Launching in the US now, and internationally this spring, Enter Night Pilsner is a unique expression of the shared values that have helped define Metallica and Stone Brewing: fiercely independent, transcending genres, shattering preconceptions and challenging convention.

Enter Night Pilsner is the outcome of a genuine creative spark between two entities that grew to become international forces of nature in their respective worlds, yet came from the fringes. An intensity of vision combined with a shared middle finger to the status quo makes Enter Night Pilsner a chorus of collaboration worth celebrating. The members of Metallica and the leadership of Stone participated at every step alongside their talented brewing team. From Metallica’s Bay Area HQ and the brewery HQ in San Diego, to many beers backstage at shows, the spirit of collaboration was powerful. Metallica’s Lars Ulrich and Stone co-founder Greg Koch even enjoyed multiple occasions at Lars’ home ‘discussing’ (industry-speak for ‘drinking’) beers. After all, there was only one chance to get this right, and anything less than an incredible result was not an option.

“The amount of ideals and outlooks that Metallica and Stone Brewing share are endless,” says Lars. “I’m always blown away about how similar our paths forward have been. Our view of the worlds that we each inhabit, of creativity and process, and sense of place in relation to our peers and ‘The Man’ are almost identical. This collaboration is beyond effortless and pure, and we can’t wait to share this incredible beverage with everyone out there.”

“I remember seeing Metallica on the cover of a magazine just after the Black Album was released,” recalls Greg. “On the cover was a quote that resonated with me to this day: ‘Metallica didn’t go to number one, number one came to them.’ I loved what that meant. Do it your way and never compromise your art. If you’re great at what you do people will come. I view that simple quote as one of the founding philosophical elements of Stone Brewing.”

Aside from its intense drinkability, craft enthusiasts will note Enter Night’s remarkable flavor and aroma which artfully combine the beauty of a traditional Northern German Pilsner with Arrogant Consortia’s modern overtones of aggression. The resulting genre-defying pilsner is hop forward with sound bitterness on the finish. It first appeared for the most worthy few in exclusive releases at Metallica’s shows this past fall. The beer will gain full US distribution in the first quarter 2019, and its global domination will roll out this spring covering Europe, Australia, China and beyond.

Arrogant Consortia is a wholly owned imprint of Stone Brewing. Its often aggressive and always self-righteous lineup of beers includes Arrogant Bastard Ale and Bourbon Barrel-Aged Arrogant Bastard Ale, among others. The world-renowned brewery is well-known for waving the proud flag of independent craft brewing, while rallying against the bland, boring nature of industrialized, commoditized ‘fizzy yellow beer.’ Enter Night Pilsner is brewed to be enjoyed fresh and is best enjoyed with your friends… be it in bars, backyards, or tailgates… with your favorite music.",Metallica & Arrogant Consortia Present Enter Night Pilsner

The annual report analyzes shipment trends from wineries to consumers in the United States. Fueling this growth, the average price per bottle increased 2.4 percent, the most significant one-year price spike since 2011.

Despite these healthy increases, the growth of the direct-to-consumer channel was slower than seven-year averages. In previous years, states have loosened their restrictions allowing wine shipments to drive growth. However, Oklahoma was the only new shipping destination for wine in 2018, leaving few states remaining yet to open for winery-to-consumer shipments.

“The direct shipping channel has matured into a mainstream option for wineries to meet growing consumer demand,” said Larry Cormier, general manager, ShipCompliant by Sovos.

Sonoma County was the standout among regions analyzed, propelling ahead of Napa County, the historic leader in the DtC channel. Sonoma’s total volume of shipments increased by 19 percent and the value of shipments by 18 percent, marking a 200 percent increase since 2011.

On the other hand, both the volume and value of shipments from Napa County wineries lagged considerably behind other regions. Napa County’s wine shipments increased a mere 1.6 percent, a response to the 7.1 percent increase in average price-per-bottle shipped.

“Napa County seemingly priced itself out of the market in 2018,” said Chet Klingensmith, publisher and president at Wines Vines Analytics. “This may be an early indicator of what’s to come for the whole channel in 2019, as price increases have historically been followed by flat or declining prices the following year. With competition from independent wine clubs and online liquor stores increasing, wineries must stay cognizant of how pricing affects consumer demand.”

Other notable trends in the 2019 Direct-to-Consumer Wine Shipping Report include:
• Oregon outpaced the DtC channel. For the seventh consecutive year, Oregon wineries outpaced the overall market. Despite a 1.4 percent increase in the average price per bottle, wine shipments from Oregon increased 19 percent in volume.
• Rosé shipments continued to skyrocket. Rosé is now the eighth most commonly shipped wine by American wineries, moving up from the bottom of the list less than a decade ago.
• The Moscato fad faded. Moscato shipments plummeted in 2018, with the average price of a bottle at $7.30, down 50 percent from its high in 2016.
• Consumers opened their wallets. Shipments of wines priced at $100 or more increased by 18 percent in volume compared to the previous year.

The Direct-to-Consumer Wine Shipping Report is an annual collaboration between Sovos and Wines Vines Analytics, examining shipment trends from wineries to U.S. consumers. The proprietary data included is comprised from an algorithm measuring total DtC shipments based on millions of anonymous direct shipping transactions filtered through the ShipCompliant by Sovos system and paired with Wines Vines Analytics’ comprehensive data on U.S. wineries.",Wine Shipments to Consumers Hit Record $3 Billion Last Year

As part of the acquisition, FreshCo has been renamed APC Manufacturing.

APC Manufacturing was founded in 2017 and has been adding capabilities and expanding its portfolio of business for the past year. The company has three CIA-trained chefs who work with clients on all aspects of product development – from concept creation and testing to packaging development and production. APC Manufacturing’s packaging capabilities currently include bag, squeeze pouch and container filling of almost any shape or size and induction seal application.

“APC Manufacturing was originally established as a stand-alone company to provide co-packing services to clients of APC. Its rapid growth has required an infusion of capital that’s best delivered by APC,” says Justin Segel, co-founder and CEO of American Pasteurization Company. “APC Manufacturing operates in the same building as APC, so it’s been an easy ownership transition.”

APC Manufacturing currently produces a variety of products, including: hummus; fresh salsa and pico de gallo; salad dressing; baby food; macaroni & cheese; soups and stews; mashed potatoes and potato sides; stuffing; pasta salads; fresh salads such as tuna and chicken; sauces and marinades; and pesto and marinara.

APC Manufacturing is also capable of co-packing guacamole and avocado-based products, fresh pasta and cooked pasta dishes, legume and bean dishes, grain and rice dishes, coleslaw and a variety of fresh dips.

“APC Manufacturing clients can take advantage of a full-service, turnkey process that provides co-packing and timely HPP services within the same facility,” says Segel. “Having manufacturing and HPP under one roof allows product to get into HPP faster, ensures the cold chain is maintained and eliminates an additional freight cost.”

The majority of APC Manufacturing’s clients also utilize high pressure pasteurization provided by APC. HPP is a cold pasteurization technique where products that are already sealed in their final package are pasteurized by applying extreme hydrostatic pressure. HPP kills bacteria that can cause spoilage and food-borne illness and greatly extends a product’s shelf life. Applying HPP to foods and beverages – rather than heat pasteurization or synthetic preservatives – results in products that have a fresher taste and better appearance, texture and nutritional composition.",American Pasteurization Company Acquires FreshCo Foods

They have enlisted leading glass packaging company, Croxsons, with the task of introducing a glass bottle to their dairy liqueur product range.

Croxsons created a bespoke 700ml glass bottle to be used for Lewis Road’s ‘Kahlúa Cream – a coffee cream liqueur. The concept was adapted from an aluminum bottle previously used by the company.

The Lewis Road ethos is about doing things right, with a focus on sustainable packaging. Currently all their 1.5L and 750ml milk bottles are made with 100% recycled plastic packaging, which can keep being recycled after use. They are considering alternatives that will reduce their use of plastic, so Croxsons’ glass bottles could become the catalyst for more change.

Croxsons needed to match the baseline design of Lewis Road’s plastic bottles in a glass equivalent, and improve the quality of the embossment. The bottles were sprayed gold, reflecting a high value product whilst also providing the liquid with UV protection. The result is a standout, contemporary product that is still on brand with the rest of the range.

A 33mm GPI closure, in a special pantone gold, was specifically produced for this project. This spec was chosen for its easy application properties, comprehensive printing capabilities, and a well-proportioned mouth opening for the size of the bottle.

Croxsons’ James Croxson said: “In terms of delivery, we really pushed the limits of what is possible. Within forty-eight hours of starting the project, there was a concept and a drawing – which were signed off within another thirty-six hours. The bottles were manufactured within nine weeks, despite considerable hurdles with production and shipping. Regardless of the set backs, this is still a fantastic achievement in terms of turnaround time, which impressed the client immensely.”

Croxsons were able to add value to the concept by including the Lewis Road Creamery trademarked cow emblem to the base of the bottle – an inventive yet simple way of creating a more premium product.

James Croxson adds: “We are delighted to make a connection with such an innovative brand, and we are looking forward to continuing the relationship by developing other product lines in the future.”

Croxsons will be exhibiting at the forthcoming Packaging Innovations exhibition. It is being held at the NEC on the 27th and 28th February. They will be at stand E43.",Croxsons Create Standout Glass Bottle for New Zealand Creamery

We know that mealtime isn’t the only time our customers are faced with these difficult food decisions, so we set out to create a more complete and nutritious way to get you to your next meal. Our customers have been asking for a lighter, lower-calorie option that still packs a protein punch to satisfy these occasions and with Soylent Bridge, we’ve delivered,” shared CEO, Bryan Crowley.

A vegan and nut-free drink, Soylent Bridge uses plant-based protein to ensure less water is utilized and less CO2 is produced compared to processes used to source protein from livestock. The innovative drink design also reduces food waste with a year-long shelf life from manufacture. Because Soylent Bridge has no need for refrigeration until opened, it’s able to stay fresh and taste great for longer.",Introducing New Soylent Bridge

Buyers with an appetite for the latest food & drink trends will be able to tap into the most up-to-date innovations and insights at IFE 2019 – taking place at ExCeL London 17-20 March.

New to IFE 2019, the multi-sensory experience will take visitors on a culinary journey as they see, smell and taste the food & drink that will be shaping the future of the industry.

Having launched an inaugural selection of 40 Japanese red wines in February 2018, Japanese whisky and wine specialists dekantā have introduced a new line of independently bottled wines, starting with a red wine from the Katashimo winery with an illustrated label influenced by Japanese cultural history.

Geisha Neko 2016 is a full-bodied dry Japanese red wine from Katashimo, one of the few wineries remaining in Osaka, and one that still maintains conventional wine-making methods to produce wine that that suits the Japanese taste. This release marries the sweet berry fragrance of Muscat Bailey A with the smoothness of Merlot. Muscat Bailey A is a hybrid variety of the Bailey grape and the Muscat Hamburg, a domestically grown grape designed to withstand extremes of the Japanese climate.

The illustrated label depicts the character of the cat geisha, ‘Geisha Neko’, a reference to the way in which ukiyo-e artists of the Japanese Edo period used anthropomorphize animal characters to bypass censorship laws and continue preserve freedom of expression. Famous courtesans, geishas and stars of Kabuki theater were often depicted as animal characters in social and political art, in which visual clues were used to hint at the true identity of the subject.

“We wanted our first private label release to embody all that is unique about Japanese wine production,” said dekantā Director Makiyo Masa. “The alluring cat geisha presents this characteristically Japanese wine of Katashimo distillery beautifully, as a delightfully subversive luxury.”

From locally cultivated grape varieties to global varieties domestically grown, the dekantā cellar is a curated selection showcasing the best of red wine produce from across Japan. Several are winners of international awards; many are chosen to spotlight smaller, upcoming wine producers; all have been hand-selected for quality and their place in the origin story of Japanese wine.

Rich and full-bodied, the Geisha Neko 2016 is bursting with notes of red and black fruit, including strawberries, blackberries, and plums. The palate delivers some dry spice and liquor-ice, before a gentle dryness comes in on the finish, delivered with a full and satisfying mouth feel.

Geisha Neko 2016 and other Japanese wines are available for worldwide delivery from the dekantā cellar.",Japanese Wine Cellar Introduces Exclusive Release

The only pod company that started in a café, Colonna employ a scientific approach and a deep understanding of the finest coffees to overturn norms and stigma around pod coffee. January 2019 sees the lauded brand launch The Bartender Series, three unique, single origin coffees (RRP £5.50 per box of 10 capsules).

Exceptional drinks need exceptional ingredients and coffee can be one of the most challenging to perfect. The Bartender Series, created by award-winning author and bar owner Tristan Stephenson, alongside Barista Champion, Maxwell Colonna Dashwood, utilises Nespresso compatible technology to deliver just that – an exceptional coffee ingredient at the touch of a button. Designed bartenders, for bartenders, the capsules are ideally suited to coffee-loving home mixologists, to take both the bar and the coffee shop home!

Colonna take the most exciting flavour profiles from the world’s best boutique producers and expertly roast and prepare the coffee using state of the art capsule technology. Utilising roller grinder technology, a new aluminium design and a revised capsule roasting approach, the Bath-based startup has been able to create recyclable Nespresso compatible capsules that translate from bean to cup ever more successfully.

For this unique new launch, acclaimed bartender and respected industry insider, Tristan Stephenson was a natural fit to lead the Bartender Series, having placed in the UK Barista Championships and created co-founded Fluid Movement, a consultancy company for the drinks industry which pioneers molecular mixology. Tristan opened his first cocktail bar Purl in Marylebone in 2010, the lauded Worship Street Whistling Shop in Shoreditch in 2011, and in 2012, Dach & Sons.

Tristan comments of the launch “The Bartender Series by Colonna is a landmark collaboration between barista and mixologist, enabling better tasting and more consistent coffee based mixed drinks. Maxwell and I have spent months exploring the potential in flavour pairing specific coffees with different styles of spirits, with the goal of elevating the role of coffee in cocktails well beyond the generic and in to the fantastic. To that end we have sourced three coffees from three unique territories, each with a unique style that leans towards one of three specific flavour camps: FRUIT, EARTH, SWEET.

The solution to ensure consistency, ease of use, and sustainability was to use recyclable capsules that work in any Nespresso machine. For the modern bar this solution meets all their needs, as it is inexpensive, takes up very little space, is easy to stock take, produces delicious results, and it couldn’t be easier to switch between different coffees during a busy shift. We think that this approach to implementing coffee in a cocktail bar environment has the potential to revolutionise the manufacture of drinks like the espresso martini as well as myriad other coffee based drinks.”

Three-time UK Barista Champion Maxwell Colonna-Dashwood founded Colonna because he wanted to source and roast the world’s most exciting coffees – and to overcome the challenges of brewing delicious, high quality coffee at home. Maxwell’s initial business, Colonna and Small’s café and roastery has been a coffee-tasting destination for the past seven years. Maxwell and his team have triumphed in the world of coffee competitions, operated a coffee school, and collaborated with scientists to constantly push the boundaries in pursuit of coffee perfection.

Loyalty is rewarded with cash vouchers, with a point gained for every £1 spent, as well as sharing and social media incentives and seasonal discounts and giveaways.

Committed to sustainability, Colonna pay a premium for coffees that ensure a high cup quality and sustainable buying practices that reward the grower. Capsule technology is extremely efficient and makes the most of the precious beans that are carefully and lovingly grown. Nespresso capsule machines use only the water you need and now the capsules are fully recyclable. Colonna is committed to realising capsule technology as one of the most sustainable brewing devices available.

Colonna directly challenges the specialty coffee world’s preconceptions about how to brew coffee with amazing flavour. Artisan brew bars and barista competitions are a far cry from single-serve pods with a mainstream, commercial flavour profile. However, capsule technology is perfect for achieving amazing results at home or in a busy bar: an oxygen-free chamber with a weighed and perfectly ground dose of coffee ready to brew. This, combined with a machine calibrated to deliver an exact amount of pressure and water at the correct temperature, means Colonna are able to brew incredible coffees using home equipment, appealing to Maxwell’s rigorous and scientific approach to quality.",Colonna: Cocktail-Focused Coffee Capsules

Fressko, a company that creates a wide variety of flasks and infusers, has announced the latest addition to its product line, the Camino coffee cup.

The Camino is a 12-ounce container that comes available in two colors: snow and coal. It makes for an excellent addition to an already-impressive line of beverage containers and receptacles that have garnered significant praise for their durability and convenience.

“We are excited to announce the addition of the Camino reusable coffee cup to our line of products,” said Hayley Culley, marketing director for Fressko. “People have already been employing many of our flasks and bottles for their everyday use and with the number of people who drink coffee on a daily basis as part of their on-the-go routines, we wanted to introduce a new, high-quality, environmentally friendly reusable coffee cup that will last for years. We are excited to get consumer feedback and to bring this product to people all over the nation.”

The Camino cup features a color-coated, scratch-resistant exterior and a stainless steel interior, designed for long-term durability.

From Sea Buckthorn to Lemon Verbena, Fennel and Hyssop, the launch of Bax Botanics Alcohol-free Spirits in January will bring a breath of fresh air to the drinks market. With no alcohol and no sugar you might think that there is no taste, but in fact, that is far from reality, added to tonic the drink comes alive, filling your mouth with layers of lingering botanical flavours.

“We have spent our lives working towards this, even if we didn’t realise that’s where we were heading,” said Chris. “My background as a chef and Rose’s artistic eye have combined to create the amazing range of edible flora that we have in these woods. We have been teaching here for years, and this is where we designed the recipes for Bax Botanics alcohol free spirits.”

“The knowledge of unusual and foraged ingredients that we have accumulated whilst researching and creating new recipes has all been poured into this range. These flavours, many of which have fallen out of mainstream fashion in cuisine, bring a variety of unique taste experiences to the drinks industry, they are forgotten treasures, which when combined with our bang-up-to-date expertise bring real originality to alcohol-free drinks.”

There are two different distillations available: Verbena, the fresh, stimulating, bright one and Sea Buckthorn which feels more relaxing and decadent.

“If you’re someone who loves a decadent or richly flavoured drink and alcohol is your thing, you’ll be spoiled for choice. But when I was looking for an alcoholic-free drink with all of the same flavour but none of the alcohol, I just couldn’t find one. That’s why we created Bax Botanics; it’s just as decadent but you can drink and stay sharp, too,” said Rose.

Bax Botanics is the culmination of years of experimentation and discovery begun in their home and at their woodland kitchen. Friends and family were the initial guinea pigs and to Chris and Rose’s delight their creations were loved right from the start.

“I remember the first time Rose gave me a glass of Bax Botanics to try” said musician and friend Scott Hutchinson. “I took a sip and told her it was delicious, but too strong for me to drive home on. When they laughed and told me it was alcohol-free I was astonished: I’ve never experienced that depth of flavour without an alcohol base. It’s amazing!”

After a particular Sunday lunch at the woods, eating campfire tapas and sampling the new drinks, the potential of taking the product out in to the world became apparent. A good friend, round the table, had faith in their palates and skills and jumped at the chance to financially back the project and bring the drinks to market. With that they set to work building a small distillery.

“It’s been a long voyage of discovery and hard work,” says Rose, “we didn’t know how it would go scaling up from a small alembic in the kitchen to a big 240-litre still, but we’ve been really pleased with the way it’s all worked out and now we’re thrilled and proud to be releasing our first products to the growing Alcohol free drinks market .”",Bax Botanics – A New Player in The Alcohol-Free Spirits Market

Slow-brew soda start-up Somersault spotted a need for a healthy option to appeal to style-conscious people who want to drink less alcohol yet don’t want to increase their sugar consumption.

Denomination was asked by Somersault to create a brand and packaging design that would be esthetically distinctive, aspirational and memorable, and that café and bar owners would be happy to display ‘like art on a shelf’.

The design team at Denomination came up with a strong graphic approach that creates great stand-out on shelf, is worthy of above-counter display in cafés and bars and provides clear varietal differentiation. The identity also stays well away from clichéd ‘natural’ and ‘organic’ design cues, looking instead to the premium-craft-drinks market to appeal to a discerning target consumer who appreciates hip, healthy options.

Contemporary pastel colours were selected to reflect the brand’s organic ingredients and good-for-you credentials. The designs are also echoed on the bottle necks to further boost stand-out and allow for a more minimalist approach on the main labels.

With so many ‘healthy’ sodas on the market in fact packing a super-sweet punch, it was also felt important to hero the key ‘low sugar’, ‘organic’ and ‘slow-brewed’ brand assets on the wrap-around label, with supporting content and tasting notes.

Finally, a strong bespoke logotype, uncoated paper stock and embellishments were used to reinforce the premium positioning of the brand.

Rowena Curlewis, Denomination CEO, says: “One of our key challenges was to create an identity that would overcome consumer scepticism that ‘healthy’ fizzy drinks lack flavor or contain artificial sweeteners. To do this we created a distinctive packaging design that sets Somersault apart from other brands, reassuring customers that they are drinking a high-quality product that tastes good and looks gorgeous.”

Neil Barker, Somersault Director, says: “Denomination exceeded the brief to create pieces of art that the coolest of cafés and bars are happy to display next to premium drinks and gourmet coffee brands. The designs provide a contemporary expression of craft soda, and the patterns provide a generous canvas that is highly disruptive, engaging and refreshing, while being understated, confident and stylish.

“Just a few weeks after launch, and with no PR or advertising support, the design has been pivotal in generating interest and excitement with the drinks trade. Retail uptake has exceeded all our expectations and we have secured listings in more than 100 of the trendiest cafés and bars in the country. Some mixologists are even using the sodas as mixers – a brand extension that we had not envisaged.”",Denomination Gives Somersault Extra ‘Pop’
More than 7 in 10 Americans (72 percent) say bottled water (still and/or sparkling) is among their most preferred non-alcoholic beverages – an increase of 9...,"January 14, 2019",https://www.drinkpreneur.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/www.drinkpreneur.com-consumers-preference-for-bottled-water-is-growing-rsz-bottled-water-is-over-1200x630.jpg,https://www.drinkpreneur.com/beverage-industry-news/markets/consumers-preference-for-bottled-water-is-growing/,"More than 7 in 10 Americans (72 percent) say bottled water (still and/or sparkling) is among their most preferred non-alcoholic beverages – an increase of 9 percent over last year, according to a new national survey. Bottled water is the most preferred beverage, followed by coffee at 61 percent and soft drinks (regular and/or diet) at 59 percent.

Nearly all Americans (93 percent) say bottled water should be available wherever other drinks are sold, with 89 percent saying they drink bottled water while they travel, 82 percent of employed Americans drink it at work, and 75 percent of all people drink it at home.

The survey, conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of the International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) of approximately 2,000 U.S. adults aged 18 and older, also found nearly all Americans (99 percent) drink water – tap, filtered, or bottled. Thirty-seven percent drink both bottled water and tap/filtered water equally. Another 37 percent drink only/mostly bottled water (up 7 percent from last year), which consists of 21 percent who drink mostly bottled water and 16 percent who only drink bottled water. Approximately a quarter of Americans drink only/mostly tap or filtered water (down 10 percent from last year), which consists of 16 percent who drink mostly-tap or filtered water, and 10 percent who drink only tap or filtered water.

When asked about their general opinion of bottled water as a beverage choice, 90 percent of Americans had a “very positive” or “somewhat positive” opinion of bottled water (up 4 percent from last year). Only 10 percent of Americans have a “somewhat” or “very” negative opinion of bottled water as a beverage choice (down 4 percent from last year).

“People are continuing to shift away from less healthy packaged drinks and are choosing the healthiest option – bottled water.”

The survey also found that among those who have ever purchased bottled water, people who identify bottled water as among their most preferred beverages are more likely than those who prefer soda to say that they always/often recycle their water containers at home (71 percent vs. 67 percent). This is consistent with a 2017 PET bale analysis study that found bottled water is the most recycled product in curbside recycling systems, with a rate of 53.9 percent, compared to soda bottles, which was 20.4 percent. The 2017 study, by the National Association of PET Container Resources, included other food and beverage containers in its analytics.

When asked who should be primarily responsible for recycling empty bottled water containers, 78 percent of Americans said consumers. Fifty-nine percent said companies (bottled water producers and retailers), 31 percent said government, and 21 percent said all of the above.

Bottled water drinkers find many factors important when choosing a beverage, but taste (98 percent), quality (98 percent), and safety (90 percent) are at the top of their list. Bottled water drinkers also say that features like ready to enjoy (81 percent), convenient packaging when on the go (81 percent), and re-sealable containers (75 percent) are important to them when choosing a beverage. Sixty-eight percent of bottled water drinkers say low calories are important when choosing a beverage, while 70 percent say the lack of artificial sweeteners is important.

Eighty-four percent of Americans say they should drink more water, and 91 percent believe that bottled water is a healthy and convenient beverage.

IBWA encourages consumers to make healthy hydration a part of their daily lives and pick bottled water as their beverage of choice, whether it’s at home, at the office, or on the go.",Consumers’ Preference For Bottled Water is Growing

Alcohol free market in recent years is recording exponentially growing numbers as certified by the results of the tests conducted by various agencies which show that particularly among Millennials, abstinence from alcohol represents a trend in sharp growth.

MeMento, the only premium non-alcoholic distillate Made in Italy for mixology presented to the market in Milan at the end of 2017, has taken a leading role in the international scene by highlighting the emerging trend.

In confirmation of its value last December MeMento has finished first in the category “Products for Cocktails” at BarAwards, as the true Innovation of the year in the sector. The product, credited by international specialists, was also finalist of the “World Beverage Innovation Awards” in 2 categories: “Best Premium/Adult Drink” and “Best Packaging Design/Label”.

“Having received these significant acknowledgments from the world beverage experts is a source of pride: I am very pleased that the great work carried out in this year has been understood and that there is a recognition for quality and innovation” says Eugenio Muraro, founder of the company.

According to the growing interest aroused by the Italian market towards non-alcoholic products for cocktail bars, MeMento has been chosen for an exclusive distribution agreement by Tek Bar, among the leaders in the import of spirits and beverages in Italy.

The 2019 forecasts are that one of the great changes in the cocktail menus of the upcoming years will be a wider selection of creative and healthy drinks, thanks to the use of new ingredients and in particular non-alcoholic spirits. Even Forbes, the prestigious international magazine, indicates this product segment as a main trend of the beverage market.

Some 4,311 wines from all over the world were blind tasted, reviewed and rated by 175 expert judges from 40 countries.

Of the nine Grand Gold winners, the top award, two used aluminium closures. Among the Gold medals 21%, were using aluminium closures. For Silver 22% were sealed with screw caps. Out of the total of 1572 winning still wines, 342, a remarkable, 22%, had the modern screw cap as a preferred closure. This has also recently been mirrored in research, released by Euromonitor and IWSR where aluminium closures now account for just under 30% of the total global bottled still wine market.

In the next category €10-19.99, 101 of 559 medalling wines, representing 18%, were equipped with aluminium closures, while the above €20 category saw a stunning 17% of the winning wines (70 out of 413) which are accessed by twisting off a cap rather than pulling a cork!

“We congratulate all the winning wines and the aluminium wine closures sector! With an almost 20% share of wines in the higher price ranges using screw caps shows they are part of the package of world-class quality wines.”, said Guido Aufdemkamp, the Executive Director of the Aluminium Closures Group.",Aluminium Closures Seal Significant Part of Mundus Vini Award-Winning Wines

Launching today, Renato’s’ Kickstarter campaign will offer consumers the opportunity to directly purchase Renato’s with a starter pack of 100 coffee and espresso capsules at a $250 reward level. Kickstarter reward levels range from $1 to $700 (excluding shipping costs) and shipping will begin in July 2019.

Renato’s is distinguished by its versatile, multi-functional brewing options, including customization of cup sizes, and the ability to enjoy aromatic and flavorful teas using convenient capsules filled with the finest quality coffee expertly roasted in Italy, and high quality tea leaves.

For extraordinary value and price savings, Renato’s will be available to consumers directly from the factory, eliminating “middleman” costs and upcharges from distributors or retailers. Online subscriptions can be customized and managed at any time for convenient monthly delivery of capsules, and 24-hour customer service will be available online or by phone for assistance.

Designed by a seasoned team of coffee experts in Switzerland, Renato’s utilizes acclaimed Swiss technology to ensure precise single-serve brewing results for espresso and coffee beverages at the push of a button. The generously sized 50.7-ounce capacity, removable and front loading water tank offers easier access and less frequent refilling. An alert system advises when the water tank is nearing empty, which avoids running the motor without water and potentially causing damage to the machine. Consumers will have the ability to customize strength and volume of espresso and coffee beverages with various cup sizes.

For convenience, Renato’s offers a quick heating, fast-brewing function and the option to connect the water tank to a water source for continuous refilling.

The large capacity empty capsule container holds up to 30 capsules at a time and alerts when the container is full. An energy-saving mode activates after 15 minutes of inactivity and can be activated manually.

Handsomely styled in classic black, Renato’s is lightweight, easy to transport and compact with a deep and narrow profile.

Renato’s espresso, coffee and tea capsules are produced in Italy in partnership with the highly regarded espresso and coffee manufacturer, Cecchetto. High quality coffee beans for the espresso and coffee capsules are expertly roasted in a small town outside Milano. Perfect roasting, grinding and blending ensures consistent aroma, body and structure, cup after cup. Eco-friendly, patented-design capsules, which can be safely recycled or incinerated, are made of polypropylene and reduced to a minimum weight of 2.2 grams per capsules for the least amount of plastic. Only one capsule size is needed for all beverage cup sizes for savings and convenience, and a variety of premium espresso, coffee and tea capsules are now offered with new options available over time.","Patented Swiss Technology Delivers Superior Tasting Espresso, Coffee and Tea"

With a long and celebrated heritage of big, bold and flavorful porters, stouts, sours, IPAs, strong ales and more, Stone is proud to continue this tradition of pushing bounds with an unconventional lager. The beer debuts now in all 50 states.

“More than 75 percent of US beer sales are lagers – predominantly from Big Beer,” said Dominic Engels, Stone Brewing CEO. “So given our history in challenging convention, and our successes in the category of IPAs, we’re releasing what I’m affectionately referring to as a ‘lager for IPA lovers.’ It’s finely crafted, intensely flavorful and undoubtedly independent, because lagers deserve flavor too.”

Hitting that sweet spot of a lager that appeals to IPA lovers, Stone’s newest core beer arrives as the brewery closes out 2018 positive in depletions year-over-year. Notably, Stone celebrated a volume increase of 17.5% for its combined year-round IPAs. These include Stone IPA, Stone Delicious IPA, Stone Go To IPA, Stone Tangerine Express IPA, Stone Scorpion Bowl IPA, Stone Ruination Double IPA 2.0 Sans Filtre and Stone ///Fear.Movie.Lions Double IPA. The latter, born out of Stone Brewing – Richmond, will debut nationwide in 2019.

Jeremy Moynier, Stone’s senior manager of brewing & innovation, explains of the beer, “This is unlike your traditional lager. When we were discussing what our next year-round beer might be we all agreed that we wanted something super flavorful and yet really crushable, all while exemplifying the genre-defying qualities we’re known for at Stone. So while we did our signature thing – seeking out the newest and most interesting hops to contribute big flavor – we really stayed focused on producing a balanced beer with classic lager characteristics. It turned out crisp, clean, intensely fruity, and definitely way crushable.”

The beer’s name is a nod to the uncharted tropical islands on which most of us would willingly castaway ourselves… provided that we could have our perfectly stocked beer fridge in tow. It’s just right for a self-imposed “three hour tour,” be it on an island, on a boat, or simply on the couch.

Aromas of citrus, pineapple and coconut are followed by flavors of lime, orange and passion fruit. A newer hop variety – Cashmere – when harvested at just the right time imparts flavors of ripe cantaloupe that elevate the juicy qualities of this beer. A welcome oasis, Stone Tropic of Thunder Lager proves to be the perfect island companion to a tropically-inspired, fruit forward lineup of IPAs, including Stone Tangerine Express IPA, Stone Scorpion Bowl IPA, and the upcoming Stone Revengeful Spirit IPA.",Stone Brewing Builds on 2018 Success

Italia Onlus, a charitable non profit foundation that helps children in serious need in Italy and worldwide, is launching the Call for Teenovators.

The objective is to find the most passionate and dedicated teenagers (ages 13 to 19), determined to change the food system and address the most pressing global issues in accordance with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. These teenagers will inspire the current and next generation of leaders at the fifth edition of Seeds&Chips, from May 6-9, 2019 in Milan, Italy at Fiera Milano, Rho.

At the Summit, Teenovators will have the chance to open the conference sessions for our exceptional speakers – heads of state, entrepreneurs, opinion leaders and innovators – from around the world, and share their thoughts and experiences with them.

Giving a voice to young people has always been a priority for Seeds&Chips. As ambassadors for the next generation, they are spokespeople for the fundamental changes that we must undertake, and symbols of the incredible potential we have to meet these challenges. It is them, after all, who have the most influence on the future, not just from a food innovation point of view. In addition to involving many teenagers, Seeds&Chips 2019 is also calling for Young Pioneers (age 20-25) to share with the world their current projects and plans for the future.

“The world needs to take inspiration from young people,” says Marco Gualtieri, Chairman and Founder of Seeds&Chips. “In the years to come new generations will have to face great challenges: soil degradation, biodiversity loss, pollution, access to water and climate change pose very serious threats to the future of humanity as we know it. With their choices and efforts, new generations have the power to help humanity transition to a better food system and to reverse the environmental damages that are threatening life on Earth. Luckily, research shows that Generation Z is poised to become the most entrepreneurial generation ever, bound to influence the next big wave of innovation and fully achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.”

“We’re enthusiastic about the synergy with Seeds&Chips because an important part of the Fondazione Francesca Rava – N.P.H. Italia Onlus is educating young people about respecting themselves, others and the environment that surrounds them,” says President Mariavittoria Rava. “N.P.H. Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos, which represents the Francesca Rava Fouundation in Italy has been changing people’s lives for over 60 years, with the motto one child at a time, from the streets to the degree.

Through our work in schools and campuses, we listen to the motivated voices of many young people who don’t often get the chance to express themselves and be valued.

The partnership with Seeds&Chips, thanks also to the support of Eco Eridania, allows us to give many deserving young people the opportunity to bring their ideas to the world stage with and be influencers for a better tomorrow.”

Seeds&Chips and the Fondazione Francesca Rava – N.P.H. Italia Onlus are thus launching a worldwide call to all teen innovators who are motivated to shape the future of the planet and of humanity.

HR-1175 serves as the companion bill to S-362, which was reintroduced by Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) in the Senate last week.

This critical legislation was first introduced in 2015 to offer parity to craft spirits producers and earned strong support with a majority in the Senate and two-thirds support in the House before its passage as a two-year, temporary relief in December 2017. Now, with the expiration date in sight, the major beverage alcohol trade groups across spirits, wine, beer, and cider remain aligned and committed to working together to bring about a more permanent relief.

On December 31, the FET tax policy is slated to revert back to a reduced excise tax rate for small producers of beer and wine while leaving craft distillers at the same rate as major corporate suppliers. The financial threat is real: spirits producers will once again pay 5.4 times more FET than craft brewers, and 16.4 times more FET than a small winery for equal quantities of beverage alcohol. Like the current legislation, which expires on Dec. 31, 2019, the proposed permanent legislation would reduce the Federal Excise Tax from $13.50 to $2.70 per gallon for the first 100,000 proof gallons removed from bond per year. This would provide parity with craft brewers and small vintners, who have enjoyed a reduced FET based on their smaller size for many years.

The craft distilling industry is growing, with, on average, one distillery opening per day. There are nearly 2,000 craft spirits distilleries operating in the U.S. in all 50 states, employing nearly 20,000 people. Investments in the industry in the last decade have now reached nearly $600 million, according to the Craft Spirits Data Project (2018), but the threat of a rising FET rate is bound to slow that year-over-year growth down significantly.

“We’ve heard firsthand about the powerful impact the reduced FET rate has had on our community of craft distilleries, who continue to use these critical savings to reinvest and grow their businesses,” said Chris Montana, President, American Craft Spirits Association. “According to a 2018 poll of our members, 93.5 percent planned to hire new employees or invest in new manufacturing equipment to increase production, which further grows their distillery footprints, peripherally touches our U.S. agricultural industry, and helps stimulate local tourism. Permanent relief is critical to ensure we continue to thrive.”

“Federal excise tax reform has dramatically helped to stimulate craft spirits growth, and a permanent relief is critically important to securing the future of our industry,” added Margie A.S. Lehrman, CEO, American Craft Spirits Association. “Without permanent and immediate reform, the stability of this vibrant industry is bound to be paralyzed. And without the certainty of a long-term reduction, it is impossible for any new or existing distillery to implement a business plan when the wide tax variable threatens the ability to hire new employees, purchase equipment, provide staff benefits, and continue to grow.”",Craft Beverage Modernization & Tax Reform Act

Michelle Wine Estates taps into both its virtuous good side and indulgent dark side with the launch of Prayers of Sinners & Saints wine, available on shelves nationwide in March.

Heralding from Washington State’s top producer, the wines feature a unique label design with hidden glow-in-the-dark features—the first of its kind.

“We launched this brand on a consumer insight that human “good” and “bad” are not mutually exclusive,” said Maggie Streng, Senior Marketing Manager, Innovation at Ste. Michelle Wine Estates. “Everyone has a little good and bad in them and this brand believes that one’s true self lies somewhere between a virtuous good side and an indulgent dark side. Now more than ever consumers are turning inward to find balance and embrace all aspects of themselves.”

“The glow-in-the-dark label,” continues Streng, “offers a dynamic consumer engagement without the need to download an app or use augmented reality. Both labels, while different in the light, reveal the same praying skeleton in the dark, suggesting that whether you are a sinner or a saint, we’re all the same at the core.”

While each wine can hold its own individually on the shelf, they tell a more compelling story when merchandised together. Consumers are given a chance to reflect and choose whether they want to identify as a sinner or a saint.

Prayers of Saints Chardonnay is bright and refreshing with 7% of the total blend comprised of “Black Chardonnay,” meaning the juice was oxidized before fermentation to reduce bitterness, increase sweet fruit flavors and enhance complexity. Prayers of Sinners is a broody red blend deeply layered with blackberry, dark fruit, violet and cocoa.",Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Launches Prayers of Sinners & Saints Wine
Fressko's premium glass- and bamboo-encased stainless steel flasks and infusers are a big upgrade from the first water bottle developed in 17th Century England..,"February 25, 2019",https://www.drinkpreneur.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/www.drinkpreneur.com-fressko-shows-how-far-the-water-bottle-has-come-1.jpg,https://www.drinkpreneur.com/beverage-industry-news/packaging/fressko-shows-how-far-the-water-bottle-has-come/,"Fressko Shows How Far the Water Bottle Has Come

Fressko’s premium glass- and bamboo-encased stainless steel flasks and infusers are a big upgrade from the first water bottle developed in 17th Century England.

Later, bottling water grew popular in Europe and the United States as many companies marketed water from natural springs, which many thought had medicinal powers.

The demand for bottled water increased during the 1800s because people feared cholera and typhoid, but production began to fall when an English doctor ended the waterborne typhoid epidemic through the use of chlorine.

The next big development came in 1973 when plastic bottles, a much cheaper alternative to their glass counterparts, were introduced.

But these early glass and plastic bottles don’t compare to Fressko’s eco-friendly glass, stainless steel, and bamboo flasks.

“The water bottle certainly has come a long way since 1622,” said Hayley Culley, marketing director for Fressko. “For almost 400 years, people didn’t recycle glass water bottles, and plastic bottles have been polluting our oceans for almost 50 years.”

As a company, Fressko, with its eco-friendly philosophy, has created sustainable, reusable alternatives to plastic, rubber or paper cups. These containers are 100 percent BPA free and designed for durability and ease of use.

Introduced to the U.S. market in 2018, Fressko’s initial product line included three glass and two bamboo flasks. Fressko recently added two new products:

Color Collection, which is a series of infuser flasks in a variety of colors: lagoon, floss, coal, denim, snow and clay.

Camino, which is a 12-ounce reusable coffee cup featuring a color-coated, scratch-resistant exterior and a stainless steel interior, is designed for long-term durability. The cup can be placed under the spout of a coffee machine and includes internal barista markings.

“The evolution of the water bottle has not stopped at Fressko,” Culley said. “We will continue to develop and innovate new products for today’s modern consumer.”",Fressko Shows How Far the Water Bottle Has Come

With newly upgraded internal capabilities, making the manufacturing and brewing process more efficient, and factoring in consumer asks and retail trends, Health-Ade announced it will roll out six new flavors this year, across retail channels, starting this summer. The new flavors, each of which is Certified Organic, Non-gmo, Gluten-Free, Vegan, Raw and Kosher include:
• Grapefruit, brewed with pink grapefruit with a splash of blood orange
• Passionfruit-Tangerine, with fruits sourced from Peru and the U.S., respectively
• Strawberry-Lemonade, just like it sounds – strawberry lemonade meets kombucha
• Peach-Mango, tasting like a fresh and juicy peach, with the mango lending just the right amount of sweetness and depth

“Developing new flavors is not only an integral part of the Health-Ade business model, but it’s one of my favorite processes,” said Daina Trout, CEO and Co-Founder of Health-Ade, who is the final taste tester of any new Health-Ade product. “We found ourselves with an opportunity to bolster our flavor variety; sourcing inspiration from colors, we set out to recreate popular notes seen in other beverage categories, that have yet to be fermented and turned into kombucha. Our primary goal is to make things that taste great and make you feel great above all else–that’s the Health-Ade difference.”

In addition to the new flavors, the hand-made and fermented in super-small 2.5-gallon batch kombucha that consumers have come to know, enjoy and expect from Health-Ade, will be available to them and retailers in new ways, allowing for greater consumption occasions. Health-Ade will be rolling out and testing different sizing and packaging varieties in markets across the nation. One such variety includes the 8oz 4 packs of Pink Lady Apple, Ginger Lemon and Pomegranate which will be available at Whole Foods Markets, nationwide, beginning in May (MSRP $9.49). Consumers can use the store locator on Health-Ade’s website to find retailers near them.

“We started Health-Ade with a small credit card and a big dream–and our 16-ounce amber glass bottles have been with us from day one. They’ve become a signature for us, a point of recognition and status. We’ve always met our consumers where their lifestyle points are so by expanding our size offerings, Health-Ade will continue to inspire and fuel customers, as they go after their most game changing goals–no matter where their journeys bring them,” said Vanessa Dew, Chief Sales Officer and Co-Founder of Health-Ade.

Consumers may have also seen new labeling on Health-Ade’s Superfood Kombucha line of teas, which was done in an effort to modernize and differentiate the two lines–giving the former a “pop” of color. The Superfoods tea line is still handcrafted the Health-Ade way, in super-small 2.5-gallon batches and made from cold-pressed juice from organic product. The distinction is the addition of exotic flavors and botanical additivities—each of which is thought to be linked to or known for a specific health benefit. The line currently includes Bubbly Rose, Maca-Berry and Power Greens with Cherry Berry, slated for inclusion upon launch.

“For the past seven years, we at Health-Ade have held fast to the belief that if you always follow your gut, the result will be happiness,” said Justin Trout, Chief Operations Officer and Co-Founder of Health-Ade. “Our guts have not led us astray yet.”",Health-Ade Kombucha Launches Six New Flavors

Shifting customer preference towards healthy refreshing and rehydrating drinks from carbonated drinks has shifted the positioning of coconut water from a niche health product to a daily drink. The global increase in demand has outstripped supply, which is largely addressed by Asian countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, and India.

Coconut water is largely consumed in liquid form, which continues to dominate the market. However, it has a short shelf-life and tends to lose its nutritional benefits when exposed to air and temperature. While liquid form will continue to have a high market share, relatively high demand is expected in the powdered coconut water. Powdered form retains natural flavors and nutritional benefits for a longer duration.

Product innovation is one key strategy adopted by companies, wherein coconut water is available in multiple flavors including pineapple, mango, lime, mango, and watermelon. Flavored coconut water has gained popularity among athletes and fitness enthusiasts.

In Asia Pacific, fresh coconut water is highly preferred, mainly in tropical countries. However, packaged coconut water is expected to grow with the increasing adoption of packaged food and beverages at large. Factors such as convenience and hygiene are expected to play a critical role in the growth of packaged coconut water in the Asia Pacific region.

In addition to flavors, companies are focusing on adopting new packaging designs to offer convenience in consuming coconut water while on-the-go. Tetra packs are the preferred form of packaging and have seen adoption by multiple brands such as Vita Coco, ZICO, and O.N.E.

Tetra packs are expected to continue to dominate the packaging space, followed by plastic packaging. In 2017, tetra packs commanded more than 40% of the market and is expected to continue to dominate the market.

The market is fragmented in nature with the presence of multiple companies having various active brands. Over the coming years, companies are expected to launch new products, focus on product packaging and business expansion. Mergers & acquisition is also evident where established companies such as The Coca Cola Company and New Age Beverage Corporation have acquired companies to strengthen their position in the market.

While New Age Beverage Corporation acquired Maverick Brands LLC in 2017, The Coca Cola Company acquired ZICO, a popular coconut brand. In addition, food products companies are investing in the market to mark their presence. For instance, in February 2018, Danone, a leading food products company, invested USD 30 million in Harmless Harvest brand. Harmless Harvest will use the funds for expanding its product portfolio and strengthening its distribution channel.

The makers of fairlife ultra-filtered milk, today announced the launch of the 2019 fairlife Grant Program, which seeks to support community groups working to improve food systems. The grant program was first introduced in 2018 in four U.S. cities with high rates of food insecurity, providing financial support to chosen organizations that serve and impact lives through the provision of better nutrition. In 2019, the fairlife Grant Program is expanding to eight cities. Five community groups in each city will be chosen to each receive a $2,500 grant to advance the vision and direction of these community-led groups whose missions align with that of fairlife.

“fairlife is dedicated to providing people throughout the world with vitality & wellness and works to achieve this mission through innovative and highly nutritious dairy products that come from pioneering, sustainable farms,” said Sue McCloskey, dairy farmer and co-founder of fairlife, LLC. “The future of a healthy population and planet is based on sustainably produced nutrition for all and that’s why we’re making a firm commitment to allocate additional resources to support the noble efforts of groups working hard to enrich the lives and food systems in their community’s underserved areas.”

The eight cities for the 2019 Grant Program and their allocated application periods are:

Organizations located in and supporting the greater metropolitan areas of the selected cities are encouraged to visit fairlifegrant.com and apply for the grant program during the assigned application period.

The portable scanner can detect contaminants at concentration levels as required by regulators, guaranteeing traceability and complete transparency.

Inspecto’s innovative device brings lab testing to the farmers, food manufactures, and retailers without time-consuming, high-cost lab testing. The Inspecto solution is fast, accurate, affordable, and saves unnecessary costs. This high-tech solution offers the food industry the ability to tailor contaminant testing to their needs and location.

“Our solution helps make food safer and cleaner, and ensures maximum transparency,” says Avner Avidan, CEO of Inspecto. “We already are engaged in pilot projects with leading food companies wanting to take product safety assurance and traceability to the next level.”

The next-gen inspection system scans the product or the crop and identifies contaminants according to specific requirements of the client. A sample is placed in a disposable capsule for detection, inserted into the device, and then activated with a simple press of a button. It scans the sample and processes it automatically within minutes, resulting in a reliable, quantified measurement of the selected contaminant. The scan can be conducted outdoors or indoors, anytime to ensure responsible sourcing. All results are stored on a cloud, recorded and analyzed in real time. This high-tech device fills the industry’s need to conduct more frequent testing at different points along the production line, with immediate results.

“Since each scan is conducted in real-time and the results are stored on the cloud, Inspecto can offer additional services to our customers that, until now, were impossible for them to implement,” explains Avidan. “For example, it enables our customers to approve or reject a shipment on the spot based on the results, and they can even use blockchain to store their information more securely.”

“We developed a portable device to ensure the safety of the product ‘from farm-to-fork’ and help food manufacture control their entire supply chains,” says Yair Moneta, VP of Business Development for Inspecto. “It can disrupt the entire way contaminants are currently being tested, reducing the risk of recalls, food waste, and potential lawsuits.”

The Inspecto device can be tuned to identify almost any chemical contaminant, in any product, liquid or solid. “The advantage of Inspecto is the ability to identify and magnify the unique spectral fingerprint of each contaminant,” added Moneta. “Moreover, you can conduct multiple scans per day without waiting for the results or paying exorbitant lab costs.”

Inspecto was established in 2016 to revolutionize the food industry by taking food contaminant testing out of the lab. Reports on the discovery of high levels of contaminants in vegetables inspired the co-founders to seek a comprehensive, fast solution for detecting contaminants.",Inspecto Hooks Food Contamination With Real-Time Results

Their first rum, Dockyard Signature Blend, is inspired by the traditional English style Caribbean rums that used to be imported, blended and stored in Dockyards along the River Thames dating back to the 18th Century.

Thameside’s mission is to change consumers’ perception of rum in the UK by championing authentic ‘Cane-to-Cask’ rum production. They work with some of the oldest and most prestigious distilleries in the Caribbean in order to support the future of traditional authentic rum production.

Thameside proudly disregard the commonly accepted practices of some of the larger rum producers who often add colouring to their rum to give the appearance of aging and also add sugar and flavourings to ‘smooth’ out the harshness of their large scale manufactured industrial distillate.

“Consumers deserve to know exactly what’s in the bottle of spirit they’re buying and how it is made. Our philosophy is focused on authenticity, integrity and transparency. We pride ourselves on producing authentic rums using centuries-old production methods and never add sugar, colouring or flavourings to our blends. What you see in the bottle is pure unfiltered, unadulterated rum. How it used to be!”

Thameside need to raise £10,000 by the end of March and are offering some fantastic rewards including giving customers the exclusive chance to purchase bottles of rum from their first batch before it is officially launched to market in the on and off-trade later this year.",Thameside Aims To Bring Authentic Caribbean Rum Back

Welcome Sunwink- a San Francisco based, female founded herbal tonic beverage that is bringing herbs to the forefront of the self-care scene.

Since its 2018 launch- the brand’s Sparkling Detox Ginger has quickly become so popular its had to rapidly increase production. Using bitter herbs like dandelion and burdock root to help the body release digestive enzymes, the effervescent tonic helps the body do what it’s supposed to do, as opposed to kombucha, which merely adds probiotics to the system (a good, but temporary fix).

With half the sugar of a kombucha (most kombuchas range from 12 – 24 grams of sugar per bottle) and 35-50 calories per bottle, Sunwink uses the cleanest and simplest ingredients – NO NATURAL FLAVORS and NO CITRIC ACID. The herbal tonic’s flavors come from the herbs. The drinks are paleo and vegan friendly; they use organic maple syrup to slightly sweeten the blends. “Sunwink puts thought and care into their blends, taking the time necessary to think about which plants they use and what they want to achieve with them,” says Clinical Herbalist, Anne Beauchemin.","Kombucha’s Out, Sunwink’s In"

With a focus on taste and quality that pioneered the premium mixer category and helped lead the renaissance of tonic, Fever-Tree is set to once again bring about a liquid paradigm shift.

Fever-Tree’s new ginger range exemplifies the same expertise that created its game-changing specialty tonics and perfectly complements all spirits, including gin, mezcal, vodka, whiskey, rum, brandy, as well as liqueurs and vermouths. The expressions will be available nationwide in some of the world’s most iconic bar and restaurant venues, including Bar Sardine, PDT, Saxon + Parole and RedFarm in New York City and The Anderson in Miami.

Like the existing ginger expressions, Smoky Ginger Ale, Spiced Orange Ginger Ale and Refreshingly Light Ginger Ale have been expertly created using a unique blend of Fever-Tree’s three signature gingers. Sourced from Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Cochin (India), the variety of gingers add an incredible freshness and aroma required to complement the large variation of flavors found in the finest spirits.

Certified Non-GMO, Fever-Tree Smoky Ginger Ale incorporates naturally-sourced ingredients with no artificial sweeteners. The unique mixer complements the complex flavor notes of a variety of whisk(e)y and rum styles, while bringing a dynamic twist to any drink.

This expression combines ginger, citrus from cold-pressed South African clementines and spice from Sri Lankan steam-distilled cinnamon. Certified Non-GMO, Fever-Tree Spice Orange Ginger Ale is gluten-free and incorporates naturally-sourced ingredients with no artificial sweeteners. It has been crafted to complement the rich, full-bodied flavors found in the finest aged spirits, in particular Cognacs and rums, while delightfully refreshing when paired with an apéritif-style liquor.

Reducing calories by 47% without compromising on taste, Fever-Tree blends fruit sugars with the same gingers used in the brand’s regular range to provide consumers with the greatest possible choices. This is the third expression of the Refreshingly Light line, joining lighter versions of Fever-Tree Ginger Beer and Fever-Tree Indian Tonic.

To round out the launch, Fever-Tree concurrently unveils its Fever-Tree Ginger Pairing Wheel inspired by the company’s groundbreaking pairing wheel for its range of tonics. The new wheel skillfully navigates through the nuances of flavors and dynamism of a wide array of premium spirits pairings. It will serve as creative in a new national campaign and will be available online for reference.",Fever-Tree Launches Three New Ginger Expressions

The LIFEWTR brand’s seventh series unlocks a new world of creativity and represents the latest step in delivering on the brand promise to support emerging artists and spark inspiration through the exploration of art and technology. Shoppers nationwide will now have the opportunity to engage with augmented reality experiences and unlock a world of art at stores across the country. Through a QR code or by accessing ar.LIFEWTR.com, consumers will be able to bring bottle art to life and even capture immersive selfies to make images on their own, provided they have the Facebook app installed on their smartphone.

In support of Art through Technology, LIFEWTR continues to expand its footprint, and is excited to launch its product in Whole Foods Markets throughout Northern California, Florida and New England. Beginning this month, LIFEWTR will be available in Whole Foods Market stores across these markets, and will bring inspiration to life in-store with product demos and giveaways. LIFEWTR and Whole Foods Markets share a common purpose of revitalizing the people and communities they serve.

“As art and technology become increasingly intertwined, Series 7 represents the future of art innovation and provides brand fans with a new lens through which to view the world,” said Stacy Taffet, Vice President, Water Portfolio, PepsiCo. “From LIFEWTR’s recent in-room AR partnership with Marriott Hotels to our newest bottle designs and in-store AR experiences at Whole Foods and other retailers nationwide, we are excited to continue providing consumers with exciting new ways to experience art through technology.”

San Francisco. Bushel, Shaka Tea, and Toast Ale won top honors for their sustainable products and technologies that increase agricultural efficiency, offer Hawaiian antioxidant beverages and fight food waste.

FoodBytes! SF 2019 marked the 15th edition of Rabobank’s global pitch competition and networking platform to help sustainable food, food tech and agtech startups succeed. FoodBytes! alumni have raised $500 million in funding since the platform launched in San Francisco in 2015, including $150 million alone in 2018. All participating FoodBytes! startups receive a mentor-ship immersion; direct feedback on products and technologies; networking opportunities with investors and corporate leaders; access to a community of 265+ FoodBytes! alumni; and ongoing support from Rabobank.

New this year, FoodBytes! recognized startups in three award categories: food and agriculture technology, sustainable consumer packaged goods (CPG) and People’s Choice (voted by the audience). Winners will receive valuable business consultation services, mentorship experiences and access to Rabobank research reports, as well as the opportunity to pitch and network with C-level food and agriculture (F&A) executives at Rabobank’s Annual Food & Agriculture Summit in December 2019.

Shaka Tea earned top honors in the FoodBytes! SF CPG category for creating the first-ever line of Hawaiian-grown herbal teas brewed with māmaki, an antioxidant only found and grown in the Hawaiian Islands. FoodBytes! SF judges not only recognized Shaka’s unique concept and strong sales traction, but also its support for local regenerative agriculture and economic development.

“Shaka Tea is expanding rapidly this year, so this incredible recognition from FoodBytes! couldn’t have come at a more opportune time,” said Shaka Tea Co-Founder and President Bella Hughes. “Working out of Hilo, Hawaii, it’s not every day that I get to meet with top leaders in food and beverage for perspective on how to scale my business. Receiving such generous mentorship and winning the CPG Award is a boon to us as we launch in 3,000 new doors this year.”

Bushel won the FoodBytes! SF Technology award for its innovative software platform and app that allows grain elevators and cooperatives to digitally connect with their growers and deliver near real-time information that informs better business decisions.

“FoodBytes! is a rare opportunity for entrepreneurs to enhance their exposure and network,” said Bushel Co-Founder and CEO Jake Joraanstad. “The quality of the connections we made far exceeded our expectations. We met a new customer on day one of FoodBytes! and can already see the direct impact this experience will have on our business as we continue to expand in the US and introduce our technology internationally.”

Toast Ale won the FoodBytes! SF People’s Choice Award, based on votes from the audience and Facebook Live viewers. Toast Ale’s innovative approach to fighting food waste – brewing craft beer from unsold bread from local bakeries – captured the audience’s attention. In addition to saving one slice of bread that would have been wasted in each beer, Toast Ale donates its profits to charities reducing food waste.

“We’re incredibly humbled and grateful to be selected for the FoodBytes! People’s Choice Award,” said Rob Wilson, chief toaster, Toast Ale. “Our aim is to brew as much beer from surplus bread as possible in our effort to combat food waste, so this validation of our mission and product is huge for us. Beyond the honors, we’re also excited to be part of the FoodBytes! alumni network and stay connected with other entrepreneurs who inspire us to think bigger.”

“The food and ag startups at FoodBytes! SF demonstrated enormous potential to address major challenges in our food system and meet consumer demand for products that provide both health and environmental benefits,” said Arif Fazal, FoodBytes! SF judge and founder, managing director of Blueberry Ventures. “FoodBytes! is an incredible resource not only for startups, but for industry leaders and investors like myself who want to preview what’s possible for innovation in food and agriculture.”

One such business being Newcastle-based tea retailer, Love Leaf Tea, who needed a presentation box for their loose leaf tea infusions.

Looking for an order quantity of 850 and requiring follow-on flexibility to change print on future runs without incurring plate costs, digital was the perfect solution for the online brand.

To create their packaging, a standard die-cut 0427 postal box was used, which suits shallow smaller products such as packs and small tea caddies as in this case. An internal fitting was designed for the box to hold the various components. The box thereafter was printed 4-colour CMYK inside and one-colour black outside with sealer varnish to the outside print.

“The presentation box is for a subscription box and a gift box we are in the process of setting up,” said Love Leaf Tea’s founder, Melanie Ieronymides. “The folk at Durham Box are great to work with and the use of digital print in this case is perfect for the application and the packaging looks so cool.

"Four Corners Brewing Co. is coming to Southern California, expanding distribution of its flagship El Chingón IPA and new El Grito Lager. This introduction...","April 9, 2019",https://www.drinkpreneur.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/www.drinkpreneur.com-four-corners-brewing-co-is-coming-to-southern-california-1.jpg,https://www.drinkpreneur.com/beverage-industry-news/retail/four-corners-brewing-co-is-coming-to-southern-california/,"Four Corners Brewing Co. Is Coming to Southern California

Four Corners Brewing Co. is coming to Southern California, expanding distribution of its flagship El Chingón IPA and new El Grito Lager. This introduction marks the first region outside of Texas where the award-winning craft brewery’s beers will be available.

Four Corners brings together the culture of craft brewing with Mexican-American bicultural heritage, creating flavorful, craft beers accompanied by vibrant, lotería-inspired branding. The brewery is perched at the intersection of the growing popularity of traditional Mexican import beers and the innovative nature of craft brewing. This blend results in a craft brewery with the ability to appeal to a wide range of culturally diverse beer drinkers.

“Four Corners Brewing Co. is a collective beer journey that has taken us from better-beer enthusiasts and homebrewers to launching and nurturing our brand with the people of Texas for more than seven years,” said Co-Founder George Esquivel. “We’re proud and excited that our journey now provides the opportunity to brew our bold, delicious beers in San Diego and raise a pint with the people of Southern California.”

Four Corners will launch in Southern California with two flagship offerings – El Chingón IPA and new El Grito Lager. Both are available now throughout Los Angeles and San Diego in colorful seis-packs, priced around $9.99 for El Chingón IPA and $8.99 for El Grito Lager. The beers will also be available on draft at popular bars and restaurants. The brewery plans to introduce more beers from its line-up to SoCal over time.

“There are many IPAs but only one is ‘El Chingón’,” said Esquivel. As the name indicates, the beer is aggressive with a chingón factor of 7.3% ABV and 72 IBU. The brew profile is malt forward balanced with a badass blend of American C hops. The label artwork of a big hop cone is a symbol of reverence to the West Coast-style IPA movement, which served as its inspiration.

On the lighter side, El Grito Lager is a perfect choice for sunny California weather. The beer balances a traditional pilsner malt with Huell Melon hops, which add hints of citrus notes and a slight floral aroma. At 4.4% ABV, El Grito Lager is a crisp, snappy, sessionable beer. On the label is a crowing rooster as if to say, “rise & shine it’s puro party time!”

The brewery was founded in 2012 in an effort to elevate craft beer culture in its hometown of Dallas. The goal was to reflect the diversity of the neighborhood and bring together creative groups of people to celebrate a common passion – and in doing so, Four Corners has pioneered and shaped the burgeoning craft beer scene in North Texas and added a unique dimension to the Texas craft beer landscape.

In years prior, the three Co-Founders George Esquivel, Greg Leftwich and Steve Porcari had become enamored by the American craft beer movement and were inspired to share their passion with others. Their true beginning goes back to Porcari’s home garage where they gained a deeper appreciation of the styles, ingredients and brewing processes as homebrewers.

At the time of Four Corners’ commercial launch, there were only a handful of breweries in the state and only two in the entire North Texas region. Since then, Four Corners has won multiple awards for both brewing and branding – most notably, winning Dallas-based D Magazine’s 2015 Editors’ Choice Award for Best Brewery.

Created by avid homebrewers, Four Corners is a brand built on humility and a respect for the uncommon beauty in everyday life. The brewery’s logo of the rooster – a scrappy but dignified animal – symbolizes its “yard birds but proud birds” philosophy of embracing, celebrating and elevating the simple things in life. This attention to detail can be found from ingredients to packaging artwork, the latter of which is influenced by the Mexican game lotería and designed by Four Corners award-winning designer Cristi Brinkman.

Four Corners Brewing Co. proudly partners with Children of Restaurant Employees (CORE) as its preferred charitable partner for upcoming promotional events across Southern California. Since 2004, CORE has raised more than $4 million, supporting children of food and beverage service employees navigating life-altering circumstances.",Four Corners Brewing Co.

Flying Embers is USDA-certified organic, gluten-free, vegan and has zero grams of sugar at a sessionable 4.5 percent abv.

The brand was founded by Bill Moses who was CEO and Co-Founder of KeVita Sparkling Probiotic Drink, which was acquired by PepsiCo in 2017. Yet again, he’s created another innovative drink for millennial consumers. Distributed since December 2018, Flying Embers has been featured by Brit + Co, Bustle, Sunset Magazine, E News!, Beverage Daily, Men’s Journal, BevNET, Mel Magazine, Brewbound, and Craft Business Daily. They’ve also participated in 100+ events and tasting partnerships with brands like Los Angeles Magazine, Hulu, Bulletproof Conference, Lucidity and Joshua Tree Music Festivals.

Moses says, “We’re really pleased to be in business with the best distributor partners across the country. It’s a reflection of our commitment to the best-tasting Hard Kombucha, and the veracity of our label claim as an authentic kombucha that has live probiotics, zero sugar, only 100 calories and a botanical adaptogen root base.”

Nearly destroyed at its nascent stages by a wildfire in Ojai, California in 2017, the team of passionate brewers credit mother nature and local firefighters for its survival. In gratitude, Flying Embers gives 1 percent of its revenues to firefighter charities across the United States.",Flying Embers Expands Distribution Across US

The Parc des Expositions Paris Nord Villepinte will become the number 1 platform where leading ingredient manufacturers establish numerous high-quality business connections. Trade visitors can expect a broad spectrum of products, concepts and innovations from established companies and promising newcomers. Since its launch in 1986, Fi Europe & Ni has become the leading food and beverage event for the industry, attracting more than half a million visitors in total. As of 2020, Fi Europe and Hi Europe will join forces to create the most comprehensive food ingredients trade show covering specialty food ingredients from sensory to functional.

Across an exhibition area of more than 80,000 m2, experts from all sectors – including product developers and decision-makers from the food and beverage industry, as well as representatives of major brand companies – will do business face-to-face with top buyers and specialists from across the F&B supply chain. Key topics of this year’s event are ‘Clean label, ‘Reduction & reformulation’, ‘Healthy and functional’ and ‘Plant-derived ingredients’. Trade fair organiser Informa Markets is currently expecting more than 27,000 visitors and over 1,700 exhibitors from 135-plus nations, including world-leading companies such as Kerry, Cargill, Naturex, DSM, Barry Callebaut and FrieslandCampina.

More than an exhibition: Insights from international experts

Since its launch, Fi Europe & Ni has not only experienced enormous growth in visitor and exhibitor numbers, but also a significant expansion of its concept – from a classic trade show to a tailor-made education pool for global professionals. This year, the show will feature free-to-attend presentations on industry trends and key market insights, a programme on food processing quality and safety in collaboration with IUFoST, as well as a special Plant-based Experience with ProVeg International featuring cooking shows, tastings, panel discussions and guided tours. The paid-to-attend conference programme will offer leading-edge expert insights into current and future opportunities for F&B professionals. Keynote presentations, panel discussions and master classes at the two-day Fi Conference (3/4 December) will focus on tackling current challenges and identifying immediate opportunities for professionals in the F&B industry.

At the pre-event Future of Nutrition Summit (2 December) independent futurist thinkers, startups and pioneers from across and beyond the industry will share their insights. The Women’s Networking Breakfast (4 December) and the Food Evolution Breakfast (5 December) are also ideal opportunities to participate in key discussions and network with peers. Once again, the Fi Innovation Awards will celebrate companies and organisations breaking new ground in the food and beverage industry, while the Startup Innovation Challenge will provide a showcase for the most exciting innovations coming from small startups, which remain largely unknown to the wider industry.

Over the last three decades, Fi Europe & Ni has established itself as a 360° event and comprehensive platform for the food industry. Numerous country and theme pavilions from ‘Free from’ to ‘Natural ingredients’ and from China to USA will help guide visitors sourcing specific specialty ingredients. At the Expo FoodTec Pavilion they will also be able to source bespoke ingredient processing and packaging solutions and services. At the new Tasting Bar, visitors will have the opportunity to taste and learn more about exhibitors’ products all in one central location.

Avebe was one of the first exhibitors since the launch of the show. Marieke Kanon, Communication Manager, says: ”We are actually one of the founding partners of Fi Europe & Ni and have exhibited since the very first one back in 1986. Fi Global shows are a really great way to increase our presence around the world, and to promote our expanding products and reach.”

Fi Europe & Ni Brand Director Julien Bonvallet adds: “Besides Avebe, many other companies have been on board from the beginning. Some of them started as young and small companies at Fi Europe & Ni – and then grew simultaneously with the show. For me, these continued partnerships prove that we set high standards with our exhibition and are always at the cutting edge. This year we are back in Paris – and the future co-located set-up of Fi and Hi Europe will alternate between France and Germany covering the two most important markets for the European food and beverage industry.”",Fi Europe & Ni Returns to Paris

"The Lab, an inventive, inclusive and interactive taproom that gives people a first taste of what's next in beer and beyond, is now open. The Lab is located...","May 9, 2019",https://www.drinkpreneur.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/www.drinkpreneur.com-the-lab-a-new-type-of-taproom-and-beverage-pilot-facility-tqdy-taa.jpeg,https://www.drinkpreneur.com/beverage-industry-news/retail/the-lab-a-new-type-of-taproom-and-beverage-pilot-facility/,"The Lab — A New Type of Taproom and Beverage Pilot Facility

The Lab, an inventive, inclusive and interactive taproom that gives people a first taste of what’s next in beer and beyond, is now open. The Lab is located at 767 N. Eustis Street in St. Paul, in the Midway and at the crossroads of I-94 and Highway 280. The Lab will serve up beers, hard sodas, as well as non-alcoholic drinks including tea, sparkling water, energy drinks, children drinks and more — giving consumers of all tastes a new type of taproom experience.

An Adventure for Tasters, a Resource for Beverage Makers

The Lab — which is a creation of BevSource, a St. Paul-based provider of beverage development and operation solutions, founded in 2002 — pours many beverages that have yet to hit the market, giving guests exclusive tastes of the newest in beer and beverage trends. The Lab also allows guests to provide feedback on what they sample via the Untappd app, which will be relayed to the beverage creators to help them perfect their recipes. The Lab is planning for its own app to be launched later this year.

“We are offering not only a friendly and fun social gathering venue for all kinds of beverage lovers, but also an interactive experience where our guests can help shape the future trends of beer and beverages,” said Janet Johanson, CEO of BevSource and creator of The Lab. “If you love beer, we’ll have plenty of it pouring, and if you’re not in to beer, we’ll still have a drink for you.”

To encourage sampling of the variety of pilot brews, The Lab’s self-serve pouring wall allows guests to select and pour their own beer and the amount they desire. On-staff “walltenders” will guide guests and help educate consumers on the on-tap beverages that will include beer, hard sodas, kombuchas and more.

As another fun twist to this taproom experience, the beers on tap won’t be labeled by brand — to ensure beverage creators receive unbiased feedback from The Lab consumers via the Untappd app.

“A big part of The Lab is to give beverage creators real-world consumer feedback on their beverage ideas. We will give consumers a beverage profile on the style of beverages but not reveal the brand name,” said Johanson. “As a result, consumers can enjoy beers and other beverages from creators of all sizes and from all parts of the country, and give them feedback based on the drink quality rather than a logo. The exciting part is that customer purchases at The Lab can turn great ideas into the next hit beverage.”

A Cutting-Edge Resource for Beverage Makers Across the Country

For brewers and beverage developers, The Lab invites both established and start-up beverage brands to explore the boundaries of the latest trends and newest ingredients. The Lab includes a pilot production facility serving as a playground for beverage creators across the country to brew, ferment and create prototypes, as well as refine recipes and formulas.

The Lab’s pilot 7-barrel brewing system helps beverage creators reduce risk and saves money in the long term — giving them a resource where they can try out new recipes in a small batch setting and get live, real-world consumer feedback to help perfect formulas.

The pilot brewery is led by Matt Hall, a multi-medal winner in the World Beer Cup and at the Great American Beer Festival, and also former long-time brewmaster at Lift Bridge Brewing of Stillwater, Minnesota.

“There’s never been a more important time in the beverage industry to focus on quality and innovation,” Hall said. “As the market expands, different consumers enter, and as competition grows, the makers and creators need their beverages to be perfected, which is why The Lab makes sense as a versatile and state-of-the-art resource. We want to be a partner in exploration and creation, and raise expectations when it comes to quality and innovation while keeping things accessible.”

Quality Assurance from the “Godmother of Quality”

In addition to the pilot facility, The Lab provides a full-service quality assurance department serving as a solution for beverage partners to outsource testing to confirm product consistency and quality. The quality department is headed by Gerri Kustelski — affectionately known as the “Godmother of Quality” — who brings more than 50 years of experience in beer quality assurance.

Beyond the beverages, The Lab offers an event space with a window into the pilot brewery that can be rented out for birthdays, wedding dinners, company parties and more. Outside, an expansive patio runs along the venue, accessible via the main door and a large glass garage doors that can open up the taproom to the outdoor patio.

The Lab will also have a full-time food truck on-site to cook up food-pairings to complement its libations. The food truck will have a monthly menu, with rotating weekly specials.

At the Intersection of Taste…and the Twin Cities

The Lab serves up a convenient location right between downtown Minneapolis and St. Paul, at the intersection of Highway 280 and I-94 — complete with free and ample parking. The Lab is just minutes from the Metro Transit Green Line’s Westgate Station, providing for easy access to Minnesota United’s new Allianz Field, Target Field, US Bank Stadium, TCF Bank Stadium and more.

Housed in the newly renovated Court & Case Building, The Lab brings a fresh new taste to the growing and on-the-rise neighborhood in an historic structure.

“We saved and re-used as much as we could from this 1940s building, including original skylights and marred concrete flooring, to maintain the open, industrial feel that our Case tenants love,” said Max Currie, Principal and Chief Engineer of Suntide Commercial Realty, the building’s owner. “We are excited to have The Lab joining us and know their patrons will appreciate the convenient location when they’re looking for a fun place to hang out, get a bite and grab a drink.”",The Lab — A New Type of Taproom and Beverage Pilot Facility
"Fi Europe, the leading trade show for food and beverage ingredients, and Hi Europe, its counterpart for health ingredients, will become co-located events,...","May 10, 2019",https://www.drinkpreneur.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/www.drinkpreneur.com-fi-europe-and-hi-europe-enter-a-new-chapter-together-1.jpg,https://www.drinkpreneur.com/beverage-industry-news/beverage-innovations/fi-europe-and-hi-europe-enter-a-new-chapter-together/,"Fi Europe and Hi Europe Enter a New Chapter Together

Fi Europe, the leading trade show for food and beverage ingredients, and Hi Europe, its counterpart for health ingredients, will become co-located events, alternating between Germany and France. Fi Europe co-located with Hi Europe will be the most comprehensive food ingredients trade show covering specialty food ingredients from sensory to functional, as well as processing solutions and services across the whole supply chain. On 1 December 2020, Fi Europe and Hi Europe will open the doors as co-located events in Frankfurt for the first time.

The strategic decision to co-locate the two events was based on extensive research conducted amongst visitors and exhibitors. Over 65 percent of exhibitors stated that they would support an annual co-located Fi Europe and Hi Europe, and 75 percent of visitors confirmed that they would visit the show every year. When asked about innovation, more than 80 percent of both visitors and exhibitors stated that they had launched a new product or a new ingredient in the past 12 months – a statement that backs the decision to offer a yearly event at which novelties can be shared with a wide audience while they are still “hot”.

With this new co-located setup, organiser Informa Markets is taking into account the rapid pace with which new trends, consumer demands, and challenges now occur. Group Director Natasha Berrow explains: “We want to offer our exhibitors and visitors a trade show that is unique not only in its thematic coverage, but also in its innovative and fresh character. It should be a platform for tomorrow’s trends, not only today’s. We want to give our exhibitors and visitors a wider spectrum of alternatives and options. With Germany and France alternating as hosting countries, we will be covering the two most important markets for the European food and beverage industry,” says Berrow. Importantly, both countries are central and accessible hubs in Europe for visitors as well as exhibitors.

Julien Bonvallet, Fi Europe Brand Director, comments: “Clean label, free from, sustainability and functionality are the trends that have moved and advanced the industry in recent years, and they have a common denominator: the health-conscious consumer. With a desire for better, more natural and healthier food and beverages this consumer has brought those issues to the table.” Many food and ingredients manufacturers therefore now offer functional products or specialist foods within their portfolios, in addition to standard solutions – and more and more ingredients’ suppliers already exhibit at both events. As innovation cycles become shorter and shorter, exhibitors and visitors alike expect to be able to attend an event every year. By bringing together the most diverse audience yet, the co-location of the two shows provides the ultimate opportunity to do business face-to-face with top buyers and specialists from across the F&B supply chain.

This year’s Fi Europe & Ni will remain unchanged as a single event, running from 3-5 December in Paris. Following Frankfurt in 2020, Fi Europe, co-located with Hi Europe, will return to Paris in 2021.",Fi Europe and Hi Europe Enter a New Chapter Together

California is the second expansion state for Riff this month. Earlier in April, Riff announced availability throughout the state of Arizona.

Some of the retailers participating in Riff’s Bay Area launch:
• Bi-Rite Market – Named one of the “25 Best Small Companies in America” by Forbes
• The Market – SF’s 50,000 sq. ft. food mecca located in the Twitter Building

Sam Mogannam, Founder of the Bi-Rite, first tasted Riff at San Francisco’s Good Food Mercantile in January. “I was very impressed, from the very first sip,” explained Mogannam. “Celebrating the natural flavors already available in the coffee bean was something that appealed to me as a chef. Our customers will appreciate Riff’s artisanal approach, as well as the transparency offered regarding caffeine levels, and empowering them to choose what’s right for them.”

The initial phase of Riff’s UNFI partnership provides availability via two west coast distribution centers. UNFI’s Rocklin Distribution Center will serve customers in Northern California, while their Ridgefield Distribution Center will serve customers in Southern Washington and Oregon.
