recent survey
 by Public Health England (PHE), children will have consumed more than double the maximum recommendation for sugar by the end of the year. 
Gavin Partington, Director General at British Soft Drinks Association, said:
“The soft drinks industry recognises it has a role to play in helping to tackle obesity which is why we have led the way in calorie and sugar reduction.
“Our efforts are reflected in the Government’s own 
NDNS data
 – published 
earlier this year
 – which shows that sugar intake from soft drinks is down 15% in 4-10-year-olds and 11% in 11-18-year-olds since 2012.
“We are the only category on track to achieving PHE’s calorie-reduction target of 20% by 2020. We hope our actions on sugar reduction, portion size and promotion of low and no calorie products set an example for the wider food sector.”
According to PHE’s 
Sugar Reduction Progress Report
 – published 
last month
 - sugar intake from soft drinks decreased by almost five times as much as other categories.
Similar reports from Food Standards Scotland claim that the decline in sugar from soft drinks has been offset by increases in sugar from other foods. This is underpinned by data from Kantar Worldpanel, which states whilst sugar intake from soft drinks has decreased by 18.7%, it has increased in frozen confectionery (+8.7%), take-home confectionery (+2.3%), and biscuits (+1.4%) since 2013.",We all have a role to play in helping tackle childhood obesity

Gavin Partington, Director General at the British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA), responded to the committee's findings.
He said: “The BSDA supported the voluntary ban on the sale of energy drinks to under 16s by retailers as it is in line with our longstanding Code of Practice, so naturally we welcome the Committee’s endorsement of this approach.
“Our members do not market or promote energy drinks to under 16s, nor do they sample products with this age group. In addition, energy drinks carry an advisory note stating ‘Not recommended for children’.
“It is worth noting the Committee found that the current quantitative evidence alone is not sufficient to warrant a statutory ban. The BSDA is committed to supporting the responsible sale of energy drinks and is keen to work with governments and retailers to achieve this – in line with and in the spirit of our own Code of Practice.”",BSDA welcomes committee's energy drinks findings

British drinkers will be relieved to know that a key element of the nation’s favourite tipple has emerged unscathed from a lengthy period of negotiation with the European Union (EU).,11 March 2019,http://www.qlzn6i1l.com/115077.png,http://www.britishsoftdrinks.com/Press-releases-/Page-1/common-sense-prevails-over-tonic-water-in-europe,"British drinkers will be relieved to know that a key element of the nation’s favourite tipple has emerged unscathed from a lengthy period of negotiation with the European Union (EU).
While most of us simply know Tonic Water as the essential accompaniment to Gin, the mixer risked falling foul of EU rules designed to prevent food and drink products from implying they have any beneficial effect on health.
The rules threatened to force manufacturers to stop using the term Tonic Water in marketing their product across Europe.
In a bid to let common sense prevail, the British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) submitted evidence in May 2014 for Tonic Water to be recognised as a generic descriptor.
Generic descriptors are terms that are used to designate a certain class of foods which could imply an effect on health, but which traditionally have not been used to indicate a health effect, and which are not understood by consumers in such a manner.
To prove its case the BSDA was obliged to compile evidence from countries across the EU to show that Tonic Water is a traditional product that has been marketed and sold throughout the continent for more than 20 years.
With just days to go before Britain leaves the EU, officials in Brussels have now ruled that Tonic Water can continue to be sold across Europe under its traditional name.
BSDA Director-General Gavin Partington said: “Whatever happens with Brexit, at least we can relax in the knowledge that the future of the quintessentially British Gin and Tonic is secured!”",Common sense prevails over tonic water in Europe

New 
legislation
 will see vehicle owners being held accountable for littering, with number plate recognition technology set to fortify the campaign.
The Keep Scotland Beautiful (KSB) charity has been pushing for this change since it started the Roadside Litter Campaign with BSDA and others three years ago.
BSDA director-general Gavin Partington, said: “Reducing litter is fundamentally a question of changing behaviour, and it is up to all of us to take action. That is why we were keen to offer our full support to the Roadside Litter Campaign. We are delighted that the Scottish Government has introduced legislation with the impetus to drive real change, and hope to see other administrations follow suit.”
With 91% of Scottish adults claiming roadside litter creates a negative impression of Scotland, the campaign fought to tackle the behaviour which ruins the view for both visitors and domestic road users.
Monitoring by KSB found that litter affects 83% of Scotland’s main roads and iconic routes. In addition, during 2018, 54% of Scottish adults said that they saw someone throw litter from a vehicle and not pick it up.
BSDA members, including Coca-Cola, AG Barr, Lucozade Ribena Suntory, Red Bull and Britvic Soft Drinks, worked in partnership with KSB and Transport Scotland, Zero Waste Scotland, VisitScotland, road operating companies and local authorities to support and promote the campaign.
KSB chief executive Derek Robertson, said: “This is a really fantastic breakthrough and one that shows that partnerships can work on littering issues. The overwhelming view of people living in Scotland is that roadside litter creates a negative impression of our country, and the message for drivers from our Roadside Litter Campaign is that littering from vehicles is unacceptable in Scotland. The solution is simple: Give your litter a lift, take it home.""

“We welcome the Scottish Government’s acknowledgement of the role our sector is ready to play in delivering a DRS.

The decision to adopt an ‘all-in’ model encompassing all retailers is preferable, as our analysis shows that this option has the best chance of increasing recycling rates.
“However, international best practice also suggests that the deposit level should be determined by the management company on the basis of what is needed to drive returns. In setting a fee level in advance, the Scottish Government is diminishing the scope of the system to adapt according to need.
“The inclusion of glass raises costs and introduces a complexity which creates unnecessary risk to the successful launch of a DRS in Scotland.
“We also remain concerned about the feasibility of introducing a well-designed and effective DRS in such a short timeframe. We urge the Scottish Government to reconsider its proposed timescale. We continue to believe a GB-wide full DRS for all plastic and can beverage containers remains the best way to increase recycling levels.”
