"Spirits, beer and wine sales have not been affected by legalized recreational marijuana sales in the three US states where marijuana sales are most established, according to industry associations. The key takeaway? ‘It’s time to stop treating cannabis as a monolithic boogeyman and start analysing it as part of a complex marketplace'.",13-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/cannabis-getty-svetlana-zajceva/9141534-1-eng-GB/cannabis-getty-Svetlana-Zajceva_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/13/Legalized-marijuana-has-no-impact-on-spirit-beer-and-wine-sales-says-study,"Colorado, Washington state and Oregon are the three states with the longest history of legalized recreational marijuana, with sales first legalized in Colorado five years ago. A study from the Distilled Spirits Council has looked at per capita alcohol sales in the three states both before and after legalization of marijuana.

It found that per capital total beverage alcohol sales (spirits, wine and beer) were roughly flat across the three states: in line with national trends.

“In the three states with the longest history of legalized recreational marijuana sales – Colorado, Washington state and Oregon – there is no evidence that legalization has had any impact on spirits sales, nor is there any evidence that it has impacted total alcohol sales,”​ says David Ozgo, chief economist for the Distilled Spirits Council.

The rise of legalized marijuana has concerned a number of alcoholic beverage producers, who fear that drinkers may choose to spend their recreational dollars on marijuana instead of alcohol.

But the Distilled Spirits Council says this has given rise to a lot of 'misinformation' about the impact of marijuana on distilled spirits and the wider alcohol market: promoting it to undertake a study of alcohol sales pre- and post- marijuana legalization.

Colorado was the first state to legalize recreational marijuana sales, with sales starting five years ago in January 2014. This was followed by Washington state (July 2014) and Oregon (October 2015).

The Distilled Spirits Council looked at alcohol tax receipts, shipment data and per capita alcohol sales in the three states for the two years prior to recreational marijuana legalization and 3-4 years post-legalization.

For the spirits category, per capita sales of spirits increased after marijuana legalization: up 7.6% in Colorado, up 5.4% in Washington state, and up 3.6% in Oregon.

“Simply put, the data show there has been no impact on spirits sales from recreational marijuana legalization,”​ says Ozgo.

“We now have four years of retail recreational marijuana sales history in Colorado and Washington state, and three years in Oregon, and each of these markets remain robust for spirits sales.​​”​

In the beer category, per capita sales have declined 3.6% in Colorado, 2.3% in Washington state and 3.6% in Oregon. This, however, is in line with a decline in beer sales nationwide and is not unique to these three states.

Bart Watson, chief economist for the Brewers Association, says the Distilled Spirits Council's figures match up with the organization’s own analysis.

“I currently see no evidence that marijuana legalization (medicinal or recreational) has had a clear effect in a singular direction on beer sales,”​ he said.

A consistent rate of decline in beer shipments per capita can be traced back over the last 10 years – starting long before the first introduction of legalized marijuana in 2014.

Watson says the decline can be explained by an ageing population (people tend to drink less beer as they get older) and a rise in prices (off-premise beer prices went up 18% from 2008-2018, compared to 4% for spirits and 1% for wine).

“Together, both of these factors would suggest you’d see beer losing per capita volume to wine (demographics) and wine/spirits (demographics and prices) regardless of marijuana.​

“We haven’t seen much change in the overall beer trend over the last decade and the overall decline we can largely explain with demographics and prices.​​”​

To look at it a different way, comparing per capita beer shipments across 10 years (from 2007-2017) between states where marijuana is legal and states where marijuana is illegal paints a similar picture.

Per capita beer shipments in states where recreational marijuana is legal look similar to where marijuana is illegal: states with recreational marijuana have seen beer declines of 1.3%; states with medicinal marijuana have seen beer sales decrease 1.6%; and states where marijuana is illegal have seen beer sales down 1.5%.

The relationship between wine and cannabis is hard to interpret for a number of reasons.

In the Distilled Spirits Council study, wine sales in the three states analysed showed a mixed picture: sales rose 3.2% in Colorado, fell 3.1% in Washington, and rose 0.7% in Oregon.

Broadly speaking, wine and marijuana tend to attract different audiences: the typical description of a cannabis user is a 26-year-old male, whereas wine typically attracts an older audience.

A key question for the wine industry, then, is whether cannabis will delay the uptake of wine among consumers as they get older; and whether cannabis will change overall consumer preferences so drastically across the alcohol industry as to have a knock-on effect on wine.

One thing is for certain: the alcohol industry will be watching the cannabis industry very closely and continuing to analyse its impact as legalization continues to gather momentum.

For the Brewers Association, the key takeaway is to treat cannabis as any other competitor. The beer industry, for example, has to compete with wine and spirits, as well as think about how to reach consumers who no longer socialize in bars​​.

""As the cannabis industry grows, it’s time for beer to stop treating it as a monolithic boogeyman that is only going to lower sales, and start analyzing it like we do so many other things: a part of the complex marketplace for consumer goods, occasions, labor, and more,""​ concludes Bart Watson of the Brewers Association.",Legalized marijuana has ‘no impact’ on alcohol sales: study
Pink drinks traditionally see a Valentine's Day surge: but the category is more a one-day wonder. Pink gin is driving growth in the gin category; rosé wine is becoming a year-round favourite; and colourful cocktails are trending on Instagram.,14-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/pinkster-inset2/9144385-1-eng-GB/pinkster-inset_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/14/Pink-and-premium-Pink-gin-rose-wine-and-colourful-cocktails-are-on-trend,"Pink gin is at the heart of the UK's gin category: grown an impressive 751% in the UK, according to the Wine and Spirits Trade Association (WSTA). Vivid cocktail colours, too, are attracting consumers; while rosé's meteoric rise is already well-documented. The WSTA notes that consumers are seeking quality drinks with a splash of colour.

“There is no doubt that the pink category has benefited by consumers love for sharing vibrant, colourful drink trends on social media,”​ says Miles Beale, chief executive, WSTA.

In gin, flavoured gins make up around one fifth of the UK market: but they’re responsible for driving over half the growth in sales.

Two years ago only a ‘handful’ of brands were making flavoured gin. By 2018, however, the category was valued at £165m ($212m): up an impressive 751% on the previous year. The key to its growth is its appeal to consumers under 45, says the WSTA.

Once the domain of a few small distilleries, pink gin has now poured into the mainstream. Gordon’s Pink Gin (‘crafted to balance the refreshing taste of Gordon’s with the sweetness of raspberries and strawberries with the tang of redcurrant – created to offer a sweeter and more accessible way to enjoy a gin and tonic’) was launched in 2017 and helped the Diageo brand's sales surge by £100m​​.

Meanwhile, Pernod Ricard’s Beefeater launched its Pink Gin a year ago (a gin with ‘soft fruit flavours of strawberry tuned perfectly with classic notes of juniper and citrus’).

In the pink: 'Pink Gin is rocketing along very nicely indeed'​

Manchester Gin has seen sales of its Raspberry Infused gin soar since its launch in 2016: in fact, in 2018 sales of the pink gin overtook sales of its signature gin for the first time.

So why is it so popular? ""I think it is a combination of factors, one is it look really pretty in the bottle and ultimately when you see it on a back bar you are drawn to it,""​ says Seb Heeley, co-founder and master distiller, told this publication.

""Secondly, a flavoured gin it is almost a gateway for people that don’t necessarily drink gin but want to try it. ​

""Pink gin is definitely not a fad, there is so much love and fondness for various flavoured gins. People have taken them to their heart so they are here to stay.""​

Premium pink gin brand Pinkster, which is based in Cambridge, entered the pink gin category in 2013. It uses fresh raspberries grown locally for a gin that’s ‘deliciously dry with a hint of fruit and an exceptionally smooth finish’.

Co-founder Will Holt says that while the colour is part of the appeal, so is the flavour.

“The rise in pink gin is driven by a desire to explore and experiment with new flavours,” ​he said. “And it clearly has Instagrammable appeal. Above all, however, our advice is to focus on the flavour not the colour. Question what makes the gin pink. ​

“Thanks to the marketing muscle of Diageo and Pernod Ricard, pink gin is now absolutely a sub-category in its own right. And one that’s rocketing along very nicely indeed. For sure, this is benefiting us at Pinkster, with demand rising as more outlets look for a premium option.""​

And the WSTA predicts the category will continue to grow in 2019 as brands launch new flavoured and pink gins on to the market.

“What next? Who knows!""​ said Holt. ""We’re wholly confident that the quality pink players will be here for years to come. What with Beefeater’s latest launch [see below], you might even be convinced that the future's orange.”​

For Heeley of Manchester Gin, the potential for flavour innovation in the category is huge - 'the sky's the limit'​ - although he says there will always be a firm place for classic gin.

In the cocktail category, the WSTA observes an ‘explosion’ in herbal bitter liqueurs and red-orange aperitifs mixed with sparkling wine. ​

“​These drinks served in pretty stem glasses have proved very ‘Instagrammable’ and consumers are keen to share their snaps of the vibrant, colourful cocktails on social media”.​

The appeal of cocktails goes far beyond Valentine’s Day and are a summer favourite.

During the UK’s 2018 summer heatwave, more than four million bottles of non-cream liqueur cocktails were sold in the off-trade.

Sales were up 56% on the same 12 weeks the year before, the equivalent of an extra 1.4 million extra bottles.

Not just for summer: ​Rosé wine​

Britons bought more than 100 million bottles of rosé in the off trade over the last recorded 12 months. This is two million bottles more than the previous year; and in value terms represents growth of 5%.

Having posted record sales of rosé last year, discount supermarket ALDI says it expects to sell 13 million bottles in 2019.

Julie Ashfield, Managing Director of Buying at Aldi UK, said: “We usually see a rise in rosé sales as the weather gets warmer and we move into spring, but recently we’ve started to see an increased demand for rosé all year round, thanks to drinkers who love to post about it on Instagram, and pair it with a variety of foods.”​

Over in non-alcoholic drinks, beetroot is helping bring a pink punch into drinks. Beetroot lattes,​​ for example, work well on Instagram, while beetroot as an ingredient comes with a health halo given that it is rich in calcium, iron and vitamins A and C.

As with gin, the appeal goes beyond pink. Any beverages that bring vibrant colour to social media posts are on trend: on Instagram #colourfullattes such as beetroot, matcha, turmeric and charcoal have seen over 200,000 posts worldwide in the last year, and this has grown by 24% in the last 6 months.",Not just for Valentine’s: Pink gin is now driving the ginaissance
"Beetroot, matcha, turmeric and charcoal are helping beverages burst into colour – all the more important as bright and beautiful photos of what we eat and drink continue to gain traction on social media channels. So how is social media shaping beverage trends?",06-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/indulgent-nostalgic-flavors-continue-dominating-social-media_wrbm_large/9116893-1-eng-GB/Indulgent-nostalgic-flavors-continue-dominating-social-media_wrbm_large_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/06/How-social-media-is-shaping-beverage-trends,"Kerry Foodservice – a division of Kerry which works with customers in the foodservice sector on insights and product development – recently commissioned Initiative to research the evolution of beverage trends globally. It says that by looking into beverages on the menus it can help identify broader trends for the future.

“Social media has changed the way we eat and drink with consumers expecting every dish and beverage to be #Instaworthy,” ​the company says. “Social sharing is now impacting the progression of beverage trends through menus, and these insights can help the industry identify future beverage trends. ​

“Not only is the beverage market highly competitive but consumers are increasingly educated, interested and adventurous which has driven a need for operators to constantly innovate and create stand-out products.”​

Research from Mintel suggests that 30% of coffee consumers are now looking for chilled coffee drinks as an alternative to carbonated soft drinks.

Online searches for ‘Espresso Tonic’ (a chilled drink made with tonic water, juniper berries, ginger, and an espresso shot) have been steadily growing over recent years and nearly 9,000 social posts have been shared showing the growth in popularity of the beverage, at a time when a significant number of consumers are searching for an alternative to soft drinks.

Many consumers are looking to cut back on caffeine (25% of consumers are interested in caffeine-free alternatives). This has lead to the emergence of coffee alternatives such as beetroot latte, matcha latte and turmeric latte, Kerry Foodservice observes.

In addition, these ingredients have a considerable health halo: important given that 33% of UK coffee consumers are interested in purchasing hot drinks with health-boosting benefits and natural ingredients.

An analysis of online keywords shows Matcha Latte has seen significant and sustained growth since originating in Singapore with a steady increase in searches for beetroot latte, turmeric latte and charcoal latte - all of which originated in Australia.

And these beverages bring vibrant colour to social media posts: #colourfullattes such as beetroot, matcha, turmeric and charcoal have seen over 200,000 Instagram posts worldwide in the last 12 months, and this has grown by 24% in the last 6 months.

Consumers continue to aspire for healthier lifestyles: leading to a rise in natural ingredients and plant-based diets (veganism quadrupled between 2012 and 2017).

Research suggests 29% of UK adults display concerns for the high levels of sugar in bottled ready-to-drink cold teas, opening the door for botanical beverages that can provide a healthier alternative such drinks, while also delivering nutrients and functional benefits of plant-based ingredients. Analysis of Google Trends, however, shows that while interest in botanical beverages is growing it is slower than other beverage trends.",‘Social media has changed the way we drink!’
A team of British and Nigerian researchers reported immediate effects that suggest a reduction of cardiovascular disease risk after study participants ingested a hibiscus drink.,06-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/nutraingredients-usa.com/article/2019/02/06/hibiscus-tea-may-help-reduce-cardiovascular-disease-risk-new-study-suggests/9118620-1-eng-GB/Hibiscus-tea-may-help-reduce-cardiovascular-disease-risk-new-study-suggests_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/06/Hibiscus-tea-may-help-reduce-cardiovascular-disease-risk-new-study-suggests,"More precisely, they found a significant increase in ‘flow-mediated dilation’ of the brachial artery after participants ingested the hibiscus drink after a meal, referring to the widening of an artery when blood flow increases in that artery, considered a gold standard to measure vascular endothelial function.

The results led the researchers, affiliated with the University of Reading in the UK and Bayero University in Nigeria, to conclude that consuming the extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa​ flowers after a meal improved vascular function and “may be a useful dietary strategy to reduce endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease risk, although this requires confirmation.”​

These results were published​​ recently in the journal Nutrients.​

Aside from a widening of the brachial artery, they found no significant changes in other markers of cardiovascular disease risk reduction, such as changes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (which was the primary outcome measure) or changes in arterial stiffness.

However, the authors added that their study was novel. Though the health benefits of anthocyanin-rich hibiscus calyces has been studied before, such as one 2010 study by Tufts University researchers that linked it to reduced blood pressure​​, none have looked at the acute impact of consuming hibiscus calyces.

Because of this, it is difficult to compare directly with other hibiscus extract human studies, though “acute consumption of anthocyanins-rich blueberries showed similar effects,” ​they argued.

Hibiscus beverages are becoming more prevalent in the US. A report by Google in 2017​​ mentioned that hibiscus was a top beverage search.

More recently, flavors company Firmenich named Hibiscus its 2019 Flavor of the Year​​. Firmenich cited Mintel’s Global New Product Development data, which revealed that worldwide use of hibiscus in food and beverage in new product launches has increased nearly 300% since 2012.

Twenty-two men recruited in Reading, UK, completed the study. All participants had a cardiovascular disease risk between 1% and 10%, measured using a QRISK2 calculator.

A special hibiscus drink was prepared for the study using a method which the researchers described as “the usual method employed by habitual tea consumers,” ​where 30 g dried hibiscus calyces in tea bags were steeped in 1 litre of low nitrate water for 10 minutes.

The study was a randomized, controlled, single-blinded crossover study. Blood pressure and flow mediated dilation were measured at the beginning of the study.

Participants were assigned to consume a glass of hibiscus or plain water with a high fat meal (buttered croissants with butter and honey) followed by a high fat meal of cheese sandwiches, a bag of slated chips, and shortbread biscuit fingers.

Blood samples and other cardiovascular measurements were collected at two hours and four hours after the meal. After a two-week wash-out period, the participants returned to follow the same protocol but with a different drink.

"Cannabis-infused beer alternatives from Two Roots Brewing Co. are coming to California dispensaries. The Two Roots brand debuted THC and CBD options last summer in Nevada, brewed as alcohol-stripped craft beer.",07-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/news/manufacturers/two-roots-brewing-co.-expands-cannabis-drinks-to-california/9119452-1-eng-GB/Two-Roots-Brewing-Co.-expands-cannabis-drinks-to-California_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/07/Two-Roots-Brewing-Co.-expands-cannabis-drinks-to-California,"Cannabiniers, a beverage, technology and brand management company, debuted Two Roots in July 2018 with ideas for cannabis-infused beer, tea and coffee products. The first launch was a line of non-alcoholic beer alternatives.

Two Roots brews the drinks as traditional craft beer and then strips out the alcohol before blending in the cannabis. The collection includes a Lager, a Stout, a New West IPA, a Blonde Ale and a Wheat.

The THC drinks are a low dose at just 2.5mg, designed not necessarily for a recreational high but more geared toward casual social occasions. According to the company, the THC is absorbed by the body within 5-7 minutes but dissipates within 90 minutes.

Timothy Walters, president and COO of Cannabiniers, said: ""We've seen a tremendously positive response to Two Roots Brewing since its initial debut in Nevada. As more states legalize recreational cannabis, users will continue to seek new, more sociable ways to consume, and companies will increasingly look to adapt to this new wave of consumption.”​

Kevin Love, VP of Market Activations for Cannabiniers, added: ""One of the primary drivers to support expanding our brewery operations was due to insights gathered on the sell-through rates in the Nevada market. Our initial forecasted run rate to support the entire Nevada market was 2,000 bbls​ [beer barrels] a year. What we found was that we were hitting those annualized volumes in 10 stores alone.”​

Launching in Nevada in July last year, Cannabiniers said the line would be the “world’s first line of CannaCrafted non-alcoholic THC and CBD infused craft beer,”​ calling their alcohol-stripping technology the first of its kind in the US.

This California expansion includes dispensaries in San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco, tapping into the state’s massive marijuana marketplace growth--it generated an estimated $2.5bn in sales in 2018.",Two Roots Brewing Co. expands cannabis drinks to California
"Carlsberg saw alcohol-free brew volumes grow 33% across Western Europe in FY2018: “We see a significant increase in alcohol-free and are putting a lot of money behind that going forward,” says the company.",07-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/birell-alcohol-free/9121414-1-eng-GB/birell-alcohol-free_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/07/Carlsberg-We-are-seeing-a-significant-increase-in-alcohol-free,"Its first global standalone alcohol-free brew Birell – which was launched in May in Bulgaria and Poland – has been met with a ‘positive response’ with a wider roll out planned for this year. It also has a number of other alcohol-free brews.

Carlsberg’s craft, specialty and alcohol-free brews now make up 30% of its global revenues.

Carlsberg set out a commitment to non-alcoholic beer in 2016 when it launched its strategy plan SAIL22.

This sets out a strategy to ‘leverage growing health and wellness trends and our R&D capabilities to drive growth in non-alcohol’.

Carlsberg observes that 68% of consumers aged 24-45 makes conscious attempts to eat and drink healthily, while its research suggests that low and no alcoholic beers are becoming 'more socially acceptable'.​​

It also notes that the growth rate for non-alcoholic beer is three times higher than the average beer market, with gross profit per hectolitre exceeding the average for the beer category.

Its strategy for non-alcoholic beer is to drive the category forward through both line extensions and stand-alone brands; as well as investing in technological advantages to overcome taste barriers and offer healthier alternatives to consumers.

Carlsberg’s alcohol-free brews include a number of varieties on the flagship brand (Carlsberg non-alcoholic, Carlsberg organic non-alcoholic, Carlsberg 0.0% and Carlsberg Nordic Gylden Bryg, for example) as well as other brands such as Munkholm in Norway, Feldschlösschen Alkoholfrei in Switzerland and Baltika #0 in Russia (which grew 35% in FY2018).

In May, Carlsberg launched Birell: it’s first global standalone alcohol-free brew. Birell’s initial launch was in two styles – Pilsner Lager and Belgian Wit – in Poland and Bulgaria, and has been met ‘with positive initial consumer response’, according to Carlsberg. This year, Birell will roll out to other markets.

Developed specifically as an alcohol-free beer, Birell has been designed to deliver the same body, mouthfeel, foam, and taste of regular alcohol. “Birell is made from ingredients of natural origin (barley, wheat, hops, water), free from artificial preservatives and colours,” ​says Carlsberg. “It contains no added sugar beyond the natural occurring sugars from the cereals. Birell contains less calories than regular beer and has isotonic properties, making it the perfect refreshment for those who like to be active.​”​ Carlsberg said it has launched the beer in response to 90% growth in the alcohol-free beer category over the last 10 years. “The alcohol-free category has seen huge growth in the last few years as consumers develop greater awareness of the food and drinks they purchase. As a result, more people are opting for alcohol-free drinks: but they don’t want their choices to be limited to water or soft drinks. They are seeking a wider range of relevant and great tasting refreshment choices.”​

In FY2018 Carlsberg saw alcohol-free brew volumes in Western Europe grow 33%. It builds on growth in 2017, where it saw volumes in the category increase 15%.

Referring to the SAIL 22 priorities, Heine Dalsgaard, chief financial officer, Carlsberg, said: “We are investing our money in Western Europe… in craft and specialty, [and] also in alcohol-free. We see a significant increase in alcohol-free across Western Europe and we are putting a lot of money behind that also going forward.​”​

The organic wine category has been growing for several years: but as consumers become more and more concerned about what they eat and drink there's now a real sense of acceleration in the category. And the latest figures show impressive growth in both production and consumption of organic wine.,08-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/millesime-bio-landscape/9113444-1-eng-GB/millesime-bio-landscape_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/08/Organic-wine-market-continues-to-grow,"To set the scene, organic wine is still a relatively small sector: accounting for around 3.6% of global consumption. But with more than 1 billion bottles of organic wine set to be consumed around the world every year by 2022, it's becoming increasingly significant.

Millesime Bio - a trade fair held in the wine heartland of France and devoted to organic wine - has been putting the spotlight on the sector.

For wine producers, the interest in organic comes from two directions. To some producers, being organic is a fundamental philosophy​​ of their business and a necessity for the longevity of their land and enterprise. Quality, too, is a key reason: many wineries feel that the quality of their wine is improved by a land free from chemicals.

There’s also the growing sense that the market is demanding organic – and will continue to so more strongly in years to come. This is backed up by figures: in five years, organic wine consumption has almost doubled from 349 million bottles in 2012 to 676 million bottles in 2017.

The EU is by far the largest producer of organic wine, making up some 90% of global wine-growing organic area. Italy, France and Spain are the world’s top wine producers overall; and with a growing focus on organic they make up 79% of organic wine production together. Spain, in particular, has seen the area dedicated to organic vineyards grow 522% over the last ten years.

With the number of winegrowing areas currently in conversion (it takes three years and four vintages to convert) it’s expected that the organic wine offering will further increase in the coming years.

Organic wine ranks top of Wine Intelligence’s SOLA opportunity index​​ [sustainable, organic, lower alcohol], primarily due to the fact that ‘organic’ is generally recognised and understood by consumers (understanding is harder for more niche terms such as ‘biodynamic’ or ‘vegan’). There’s strong awareness of the term, not only within the trade and with consumers, but also as a knock-on effect from neighbouring F&B categories such as coffee and chocolate.

What is an organic wine?​

In the EU, organic production has been regulated since 1991. There are also rules for organic vinification.

In short, wine must be made without the use of chemicals or GMOs, using only natural fertilizers such as green manure or compost, and there are restrictions or bans on certain procedures and additives, and a restriction on the total sulphite level in the finished wine.

For organic wine producers in the EU converting to organic is a long process: it takes three years and four vintages to convert to organic.

However, with a number of winegrowing areas currently in conversion, this suggests the organic wine offering will increase further in the coming years.

In the US, organic wines must follow the same requirements of USDA organic certification as other products, as well as meeting the requirements of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, especially in regards to sulphite labeling. There is a distinction between ‘wine made with organic grapes’ and ‘organic wine’ (which also requires the yeast and other agricultural ingredients to be organic).

France – a country where the organic food sector has really taken off in recent years – is seeing a mirroring boom in the organic wine sector. The turnover for the sector has leaped up, with an increased number of vineyards converting to organic and more sustained demand from consumers both at home and abroad. “The universe of organic wines is in full expansion and shows no signs of stopping​,” says Patrick Guiraud, president of SudVinBio, the French inter-professional association for organic wines in the southerly Occitanie region, and organisers of annual organic wine fair MillesimeBio. ""At a global level, more than 1bn bottles will be consumed annually from 2022.​ ""The French organic wine sector is structured to respond to this demand: and the strong acceleration in conversions over the last three years helps meet demand.” ​ In 2016, 87 new vineyards turned to organic practices. In 2017, this figure was 572. There are now 5,835 vineyards either certified organic or in conversion. At the end of 2017, 10% of Frances vineyards were either certified organic or in conversion. There are 1,778 million hectares, up 15.6% on the previous year. The area of organic vineyards has increased 249% over the last 10 years. The top producer is the southern Occitanie area: which represents 36.5% of the country’s organic wine area and producing 800,000 hectolitres of wine in 2018. In a favourable year, organic production can be expected to come in at around 1 million hectolitres. In Corsica, organic vineyards are an integral part of the industry: making up more than 30% of the total area. Organic wineries create, on average, 1.5x more jobs than their non-organic counterparts.

They can also take several forms: volume-based (one peso per liter of the finished product, for example), sugar-content based (such as the UK's tiered tax system) or value-based (ad valorem​) which adds a percentage of the product's value to its price.

In June 2015, Barbados, which has an adult obesity prevalence of around 34%, according to a national survey​, ​brought in a 10% ad valorem tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs).

The levy applies to carbonated soft drinks, juice drinks, sports drinks and fruit juices, and has resulted in a price increase of 5.9%, according to studies conducted after the introduction. Bottled waters, 100% juices, coconut water, unsweetened milk, and powdered drinks are exempt.

In this open-access study, published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity​, the researchers wanted to determine the impact of the tax on islanders' consumption habits.

“It is important to evaluate ad valorem SSB taxes (in addition to specific SSB taxes), to assess whether tax structure is associated with a differential effect,""​ they write. ""An increasing number of countries have implemented ad valorem SSB taxes, including Peru (25%), the United Arab Emirates (50%) and Chile (18%).​

“However, if ad valorem taxes incentivize brand down-switching more than specific taxes, they may undermine some of the intended health impact of these policies.”​

The researchers used electronic point-of-sale data from a supermarket chain, which represents 32% of the island’s grocery market share, to calculate sales of sugar-sweetened beverages and other beverages between January 2013 and October 2016.

After adjusting the data to take into account seasonality, inflation, tourism and holidays, they found that average weekly sales of SSBs decreased by 4.3% compared to expected sales without a tax.

This was primarily driven by a decrease in carbonated SSBs sales of 3.6%, they write. Sales of non-SSBs, meanwhile, increased by 5.2% with bottled water sales increasing by an average of 7.5%.

“This study suggests that the Barbados SSB tax was effective at reducing sales of SSBs and increasing sales of non-SSBs in a major grocery store chain.”​

However, after stratifying the results by price, they found ""evidence to suggest that consumers may have changed their behavior in response to the tax by purchasing cheaper sugary drinks, in addition to substituting to untaxed products. This has important implications for the design of future SSB taxes.""​

“[It also] has important consequences from a health perspective and may reduce the potential public health effectiveness of SSB taxes,” ​they write. “A policy that encourages consumers to substitute towards cheaper SSBs may lead to an increase in sugar consumption in cases where cheaper SSBs are associated with higher levels of sugar. ​

“On the other hand, if cheaper SSBs are lower in sugar content, such as sugar-sweetened flavored waters, overall sugar consumption may still be reduced.”​

The researchers point out three areas for future research.

""First, it will be helpful to develop a better understanding of the extent to which consumers substitute to cheaper alternatives (such as other SSBs or non-beverage high-sugar confectionary, rather than to ​non-SSBs), and to also measure the impact this may have on total sugar consumption. ​

""Second, it will be necessary to assess the extent to which behavioral responses vary by socioeconomic group and by gender and age. ​

""Third, it will be useful to model demand systems to simulate a range of future policy options, including increased SSB tax rates, and taxes or subsidies on other food and beverages.​

""Future simulation studies should take into account tax structure as well, and explicitly address potential brand down-switching behaviors,""​ they suggest. ​

"Children and adolescents who excessively consume caffeine-containing energy drinks over a short period of time, can experience sleep problems, anxiety and heart palpitations, say Norway’s food authorities.",11-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/nutraingredients.com/article/2019/02/07/norway-s-food-authorities-warn-of-caffeine-containing-energy-drinks-effect-on-kids/9121865-2-eng-GB/Norway-s-food-authorities-warn-of-caffeine-containing-energy-drinks-effect-on-kids_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/07/Norway-s-food-authorities-warn-of-caffeine-containing-energy-drinks-effect-on-kids,"A risk assessment​​ carried out on behalf of the Norwegian Food Safety Authority found caffeine consumption above 1.4 milligrams (mg) per kilogram of body weight per day (kg/bw/day) may pose a risk of sleep disturbance.

If the intake is above 3 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, there is a negative risk of effects on the cardiovascular and central nervous system.

“The highest acute intake of energy drinks containing 32 mg caffeine per dl, consumed within a short time, e.g. during a 24-hour period, may pose a risk of sleep disturbances and other general adverse health effects in 8- to 18-year-olds,”​ the report concluded.

“A regular intake poses little or no risk in this age group. A high regular intake poses low or no risk for 8- to 12-year-olds, while for 13- to 18-year-olds it may pose a risk of sleep disturbances.”​

The effect of energy drinks on adults and especially on children is an ongoing issue throughout Europe, with the drinks’ sugar, caffeine and taurine content of particular concern to authorities.

Current EU legislation requires drinks with over 150 mg of caffeine per litre to be labelled ‘High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breast-feeding women’.

Other countries like Lithuania and Latvia have banned the sale of energy drinks to under-18s. In Sweden, a number of energy drinks are only sold in pharmacies and banned to under-15s.

The UK is currently looking into restricting the sale of energy drinks to children under 16 years of age. If passed, the legislation would mean retailers would be unable to sell drinks with more than 150 mg of caffeine per litre to children.

The government is now evaluating responses to its consultation, which closed 21 November 2018.

While the Norwegian report said occasional energy drink consumption by youngsters in moderation was not linked to negative health effects, there was concern over the addictive nature of the drinks’ high caffeine content.

“Children and adolescents who consume energy drinks tend to have a higher caffeine intake than youths who do not consume energy drinks,”​ the report said, which was carried out by the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food and Environment (VKM).

“That is, children and young people who consume energy drinks also seem to consume more of other foods and drinks containing caffeine than do youths who don’t consume energy drinks. This conclusion is based on the average daily caffeine intake for the population studied.”​

Additional findings pointed to a little or no risk that regular intake of caffeine from food and drinks, except for from soft drinks posed to 8- to 18-year-olds.

However, a Norwegian Consumer Council investigation said a high regular intake of caffeine from beverages other than from energy drinks may pose a risk for sleep disturbance to 16- to 18-year-olds.

The same observation applied to 13- to 15-year-olds, but only for those who drunk energy drinks. For 10- to 12-year-olds, a high regular intake may pose a risk to both sleep disturbance and other general adverse health effects, but again this applies only to the group that drinks energy drinks.

The study acknowledged that participants in the age group 10-12 are too few to come to any firm conclusions about how high intake of energy drinks may affect them.

According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) consumption of a single dose of 480 ml energy drink containing caffeine equivalent to a dose of 3.4 mg/kg bw led to an increase in blood pressure.

Single doses of caffeine equivalent to 1 mg/kg bw to 6.2 mg/kg bw increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures with 0.5-9 mm Hg and 1-9 mm Hg, respectively, for the healthy, general population (including children and adolescents 8-17 years).

EFSA noted that habitual consumption in adults, doses up to 400 mg caffeine per day (5.7 mg caffeine/kg bw for a 70 kg adult) do not raise fasting blood pressure significantly after habituation to caffeine takes place.

The Authority further stated that changes in blood pressure induced by repeated intake of caffeine would be of low clinical relevance for healthy individuals.

This applies only if the intakes would not exceed the maximum plasma concentrations that can be achieved with a single dose of 200 mg caffeine (about 3 mg/kg bw for 70 kg person).

EFSA also noted that in children, regular consumption of 3 mg caffeine/kg bw in children would not induce anxiety or behavioural changes.

“Children appear to develop tolerance to the effects on the central nervous system at high habitual intakes of caffeine (over 300 mg per day) and show withdrawal symptoms,”​ the Authority said.

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority will send its recommendations to the Ministry of Health and Care Services by Feb 15.",Norway’s food authorities warn of caffeine-containing energy drinks’ effect on kids
Coca-Cola is launching its first new Coca-Cola trademark flavor innovations in a decade in the US this month: with Orange Vanilla Coke and Orange Vanilla Coke Zero Sugar.,11-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/article/2019/02/11/memories-of-carefree-summer-days-coca-cola-launches-orange-vanilla-coke/9131791-1-eng-GB/Memories-of-carefree-summer-days-Coca-Cola-launches-Orange-Vanilla-Coke_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/11/Memories-of-carefree-summer-days-Coca-Cola-launches-Orange-Vanilla-Coke,"The two new flavors will hit shelves on February 25th​.

Orange Vanilla Coke was developed in less than a year, beating off other flavor potentials of raspberry, lemon and ginger. “We wanted to bring back positive memories of carefree summer days,” ​said Kate Carpenter, brand director, Coca-Cola. “That’s why we leaned into the orange-vanilla flavor combination – which is reminiscent of the creamy orange popsicles we grew up loving, but in a classically Coke way.”​

Coke Orange Vanilla was launched in Canada last year, along with Coke Orange No Sugar in Australia – and Coca-Cola reports that ‘consumers in both markets loved the taste’.

While trademark Coca-Cola is one of the strongest brands in the world, Carpenter says the potential of additional flavors has not been embraced to date.

Cherry Coke (launched in 1985) and Vanilla Coke (launched in 2007), along with their zero-calorie variants – have seen ‘strong growth’ in recent years with only limited marketing support, she says.

But despite this, only 12% of Coca-Cola drinkers have been choosing flavors: “This showed us our fans want choice but are getting it outside the Coke Trademark,” ​says Carpenter.

In 2018 Coca-Cola rebranded and relaunched Diet Coke, complete with the launch of four flavors: Feisty Cherry, Zesty Blood Orange, Twisted Mango and Ginger Lime (the portfolio has just been joined by Blueberry Acai and Strawberry Guava​​). Coca-Cola says that such flavor innovation has been one of the contributing factors in turning the brand around and back to volume growth.​​

With the new Coca-Cola Orange Vanilla being developed in less than a year, Coca-Cola says this proves the company can be as agile as smaller counterparts: “​The launch is the latest example of us ​listening to what consumers want and offering an array choices that satisfy a variety of changing tastes and lifestyles – and moving quickly and taking smart risks to bring more drinks to market.""​

Like the flagship Coca-Cola drink, Orange Vanilla is sweetened with high fructose corn syrup and a 12 fl oz can contains 140 calories and 39g sugar. Orange Vanilla Zero Sugar is sweetened with aspartame and acesulphame potassium (as is Coca-Cola Zero Sugar).

Orange Vanilla Coke and Orange Vanilla Coke Zero Sugar will be available in 12-oz cans and 20-oz PET bottles; as well as at Freestyle fountain dispensers (initially exclusively at Wendy’s restaurants). Promotional 12-oz. sleek cans of Orange Vanilla Coke, Orange Vanilla Coke Zero Sugar, Cherry Coke and Cherry Coke Zero Sugar will be available for a limited time.",‘Memories of carefree summer days’: Coca-Cola launches Orange Vanilla Coke
"A third-generation farmer in England has expanded his company’s cold pressed juice range in the UK, with plans to export to Scandinavia later this year.",11-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/b.fresh-about-us-sq-cold-press/9134544-1-eng-GB/B.fresh-about-us-sq-cold-press_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/11/Field-to-bottle-British-farmer-grows-cold-pressed-juice-market-in-Europe,"Cold pressed juice company B. Fresh has expanded its juice range to include three cold pressed ‘shots’: King Kale, Rocket Fuel, and Ginger Fix.

The range joins a selection of ‘Watered Up’ juice/water mixes, cold pressed juices, super smoothies, and most recently, plant-based protein shakes, all of which are produced on-site at B. Fresh founder Philip Maddocks’ Shropshire farm.

“We own our own facility, we are here in the UK growing, producing, bottling. It’s a ‘field-to-bottle’ story if you like. None of our competitors right now have that capacity,” ​B. Fresh marketing manager Katie Briggs told FoodNavigator, adding that the company plans to expand to distribution to Northern Europe this quarter.

Maddocks founded B. Fresh in 2014, after a ‘freak hailstorm’ affected his spinach crops one summer. “The hail had peppered all the spinach leaves, which obviously makes them no use to supermarkets because they didn’t look good,” ​explained Briggs. “Nutritionally, however, they were absolutely fine.”​

A quick Google search had Maddocks investigating alternative uses for spinach, notably in green juices, before the West Midlands farmer flew to the US and discovered a well-established, growing cold pressed juice market.

On his return to the UK, Maddocks launched B. Fresh on the premise that he would grow as many of the juice ingredients as possible.

This is still the case, Briggs told this publication, although Shropshire weather doesn’t allow for the cultivation of oranges, lemons or limes, which are imported for processing.

For fruit and vegetables that can be grown close by, the company aims to source locally. “We’ve always had this ‘own grown, known grown’ philosophy, so we know that our beetroot is grown in Doncaster, the apples come from Herefordshire. We like to know where [all our produce] is coming from, to try and keep our carbon footprint down,” ​said Briggs.

The cold pressed juice is well developed in certain part of the US and Australia, with the global market expected to grow by 7.2% until 2024.

In the UK, however, the cold juice movement hasn’t “taken hold” ​as it has overseas, said Briggs. “There is no real science behind this, but we do feel that it could be weather related,” ​she said, suggesting that on grey days consumers are more likely to reach for a coffee or hot drink.

However, B. Fresh does see cold pressed juices as a growing trend – due to, in part, growing awareness of added sugar in beverages. “The [UK] sugar tax element has obviously had an effect on the juice market. People are much more aware of what they’re reaching for.​

“Our juice has benefited because it uses vegetable elements that lower the natural sugars within the juice.”​

Unlike most fruit juices found in the supermarket aisle, which are pasteurised (heat treated), cold-pressed juices are manufactured in cooler temperatures. “With any heat treatment, there is an element of cooking. There is a loss of nutrients in that process,” ​said Briggs.

Cold press juices, however, are designed to retain higher levels of nutrients and vitamins, she continued. “We don’t interfere with the natural flavours so much, our customers tell us that you can really identify [different] flavours, so you know that it’s much fresher than [the] pasteurised process.”​

The process involves pressing freshly washed fruit and vegetables before the blends are bottled, and placed into a high-pressure chamber. The chamber is flooded with water and subjected to three minutes of high pressure. “That is equal to five times the pressue you’d find at the bottom of the ocean,” ​explained Briggs.

This process kills all micro spoiling organisms and extends its shelf life. The correct pH balance is also required to ensure extended shelf life, we were told. “This is why there is always a citrus element to all our juices.” ​

However, the cold pressed process, which requires that bottles be exposed to extreme pressure, is not yet conducive to plastic alternatives.

“We’re wedded to plastic…which makes for a bit of a ‘head scratch time’ because we’ve got to find an alternative to plastic high pressure processing,” ​she told this publication.

B. Fresh relies on the flexibility of the vessel: “Glass would shatter, metal would crumble. Plastic is the best material to use.”​

While the search for an alternative substance continues, the company has ensured its bottles are recyclable, and made of 25% recycled plastic. “We obviously need to increase that and we’re looking into plant-based plastics,” ​said Briggs.",Field-to-bottle: British farmer grows cold pressed juice market in Europe

"Asahi will acquire the beer business of London Pride maker Fuller, Smith & Turner: strengthening the Japanese brewer’s presence in Europe.",25-Jan-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/article/2019/01/25/asahi-to-acquire-fuller-s-beer-business-for-250m/9071727-4-eng-GB/Asahi-to-acquire-Fuller-s-beer-business-for-250m_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/01/25/Asahi-to-acquire-Fuller-s-beer-business-for-250m,"Fuller’s, which was founded in London in 1845, produces premium brands such as London Pride ale, lager Frontier, and cider Cornish Orchards. The business being sold to Asahi Europe Ltd for £250m ($328m) consists of Fuller’s beer, cider and soft drinks brewing and production, wine wholesaling and distribution.

Asahi has been strengthening its presence in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, particularly with the acquisitions of former SABMiller brands Peroni, Grolsch​​ and Pilsner Urquell​​ in recent years.

“Through the acquisition of these businesses and brands, we aim to establish a unique position as a global player that will grow based on renowned premium brands, in addition to Super Dry, Peroni, and Pilsner Urquell”,​ says Asahi.

Fuller’s main production facility is the Griffin Brewery in Chiswick London, which has been brewing since 1654, and where brewing will continue under Asahi.

Fuller’s says it will turn its focus onto its pubs and hotels, which is the core of its business and responsible for 87% of Fuller’s operating profits.

The sale of its beer business will give it ‘significant capital’ to invest in its pubs and hotels.

Fuller’s and Asahi Europe Ltd will also form a strategic alliance, with Asahi acting as a key supplier to Fuller’s pubs and hotels.

“The beer business has been an important part of the Fuller’s history and brand identity, and its premium beers and ciders are a key part of what differentiates Fuller’s from its competitors,”​ says Fuller’s in a statement.

“However, the core of Fuller’s today, and the driver of future growth, is the Fuller’s pubs and hotels business. ​

“Given the existing relationship between the parties, with Asahi being a current key supplier to Fuller’s pubs and hotels business, and Asahi’s focus on brewing quality and brand building, Asahi was considered the ideal owner of the Beer Business and a valuable partner for Fuller’s. ​

“The Board believes that Asahi will foster an environment in which the Beer Business can flourish, both in the UK and internationally.”​

Fuller's continues: “Recent structural changes to the beer industry, which have resulted in material economies of scale benefiting global brewers and a progressive beer duty spawning small brewers (resulting in over 2,000 breweries in the UK), have been challenging for the mid-sized Beer Business to navigate while maintaining the commitment made to customers to brew exceptional, award-winning beer at Fuller’s historic Chiswick home,”​ it says.

In response to the challenges, it points to the acquisitions it has made such as premium cider and soft drinks maker Cornish Orchards, craft cask brewer Dark Star Brewing and boutique drinks wholesaler Nectar Imports. The beer business has also developed new products such as Frontier Premium London Lager to drive volumes.

But Fuller’s concludes that, with limited financial resources compared to global brewers, the company's 'ability to add further value and drive organic growth in the Beer Business and its brands is constrained'.",Asahi to acquire Fuller’s beer business for £250m
"As Singapore winds up its public consultation on sugar tax, the majority of participants have demanded sugar-reduction methods that extend more broadly across the industry beyond just targeting sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs).",28-Jan-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-asia.com/headlines/policy/too-draconian-singapore-companies-demand-broader-options-as-sugar-tax-public-consultation-draws-to-a-close/9068560-1-eng-GB/Too-draconian-Singapore-companies-demand-broader-options-as-sugar-tax-public-consultation-draws-to-a-close_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/01/28/Too-draconian-Singapore-companies-demand-broader-options-as-sugar-tax-public-consultation-draws-to-a-close,"At a recent such session held by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on January 19, beverage companies appear particularly concerned with the sustainability of sugar tax and its specific targeting of SSBs. Such a focused measure is not expected to have lasting results.

“It will simply shift the consumer to unregulated products like bubble tea, or those that are served fresh in coffee chains,”​ said Deputy CEO of Pokka International Daniel Teo via a Channel NewsAsia ​video,​ citing tobacco taxes and their failure to significantly reduce smoking as an example.

“If you look at the research carefully, 50% of the cause of diabetes is attributed to sugars in food and processed food, so that's a huge other part that needs to be addressed.”​

Teo also suggested that MOH reward companies that produce healthier products instead, because ‘nobody likes punishments or a punitive approach’​.

That said, the government currently still appears ready to stand by its initial proposal.

Senior Minister of State for Health Edwin Tong said at the consultation session that the tax was a measure that the government hoped would ‘influence and shape’​ both consumer and manufacturer behaviour.

“If we impose taxes, if we do take that step and end up collecting more tax, then I think something is not right. It means that people are willing to pay that tax to consume the same amount of sugar,” ​Tong added.

The consultation participants also voiced that a complete ban on higher sugar drinks (5.5 teaspoons of sugar or more per 250ml) is what was described as a ‘draconian’ measure, and requesting for a wider selection of healthier options instead.

MOH proposed four measures to tackle sugar consumption and diabetes in December last year​. These were: 1) A ban on Higher-Sugar Pre-Packaged SSBs, 2) An excise duty on manufacturers and importers, 3) a mandatory Front-of-Pack nutrition label and 4) implementing advertising regulations that limit exposure to less healthy food and drinks ads.

The public consultation on these proposals ran from December 4 2018 to January 25 2019.

According to The Straits Times​, the January 19 session was the last of over 10 sessions held since December, and MOH has gathered comments from over 3,000 members of the public via online and offline channels thus far.

Concurring with Pokka International, trade body Food Industry Asia previously commented via a statement that: “[There] should be a more collaborative multi-stakeholder approach, including the industry, to help solve some of these issues rather than present options like blanket bans or those that may be viewed as discriminatory in nature.”​

FIA Executive Director Matthew Kovac added that ‘there is no magic bullet’​​ to tackle chronic diseases, and that ‘many scientific studies have suggested [limited effectiveness] of sugar tax in limiting SSB consumption’​​.

As for the ban on higher-sugar packaged drinks, he said: “Consumption habits are hard to change and an outright ban on pre-packaged SSBs will not guarantee an overall fall in sugar intake as consumers may simply choose other foods that can satisfy their needs.​

“The prevention of Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) goes beyond sugar reduction – it requires adopting a balanced diet and maintaining an active lifestyle. A more effective approach would be one that is coordinated across all levels, including steps such as nutrition and physical education.”​ ​

Similarly, Coca-Cola Singapore had told Channel News Asia​ last year that “We believe there are more effective ways to address diabetes and obesity than taxes or advertising restrictions that only target beverages.​”​",‘Too draconian’: Singapore companies demand broader options as sugar tax public consultation draws to a close

Coastal Haze is available in California state dispensaries, and plans to roll out to other legal markets in the future.

Lyden Henderson, COO of High Style, said ""Getting to market has been quite the process, however, we want to thank the California Department of Health (CDPH) and Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) for their communication and guidance in helping us bring the first state-certified product in this new category to California.​

""While we were busy formulating our beverage, the State of California was hard at work formulating regulations.​

""Packaging, labeling, childproofing and testing requirements were constantly evolving and ultimately ended up pushing back our launch. The various state agencies did an amazing job of responding to our questions and concerns in a timely manner, ensuring that we went to market with their blessing.""​

The drinks use Cascade and Amarillo hops with notes of citrus and tropical fruit. Each 12oz bottle contains 50 calories. The first launch is infused with 10mg of THC extract and High Styles says the effects are felt within 20-30 minutes. Coastal Haze is also planning a to launch a second beer containing 5mg of THC and 5mg of CBD in the first quarter of 2019.

""Selection of our THC extract was very important. A one- to two-hour delay from consumption to onset of effects was unacceptable to us,”​ Henderson said.

“We believe that our consumers deserve a 'self-regulating' product, where they know by the time they finish their first High Style whether or not their individual tolerance will allow them to responsibly have another.""​

Ceria Brewing Company introduced the first THC de-alcoholized craft beer in Colorado earlier this month, helmed by the former brewmaster of Blue Moon. Ceria is brewed with blood orange peel and coriander, infused with 5mg of THC per 10oz bottle.

Two Roots Brewing Co. also launched from Cannabiniers in July 2018, reportedly the first THC beer to become commercially available in the US. Two Roots hit Nevada dispensaries first and has just 2.5mg of THC per 12oz can, dissipating within 90 minutes.",High Style launches California's first alcohol-removed THC craft beer
Coca-Cola says advances in packaging technology should be open to all: and has pledged to share its technology - even with its competitors - to enhance collaborative efforts on sustainability.,28-Jan-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/article/2019/01/28/from-cars-to-ketchup-coca-cola-pledges-to-make-eco-tech-available-to-all/9078601-13-eng-GB/From-cars-to-ketchup-Coca-Cola-pledges-to-make-eco-tech-available-to-all_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/01/28/From-cars-to-ketchup-Coca-Cola-pledges-to-make-eco-tech-available-to-all,"Coca-Cola has been sharing its PlantBottle technology with non-competitors for several years – in collaborations with companies such as Heinz and Ford – but is now pledging to open technology to competitors in the beverage industry.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey highlighted the importance of collective action.

“One of the actions we’re taking is to make available to anyone - including our competitors - our packaging technology around using plant waste to make plastic bottles, because we want to do is see the biggest collective action on design of sustainable packaging and recovery of sustainable packaging, because that’s the collective action that will make all the industries more sustainable.”​

Coca-Cola’s PlantBottle is a fully recyclable PET plastic bottle which replaces around 30% of the petroleum content with material from sugar cane and other plant matter. The result is a bottle which ""​looks, functions and recycles like traditional PET but has a lighter footprint on the planet and its scarce resources."" ​

First launched in 2009, it is now used in a number of Coca-Cola owned brands: such as Dasani water, Honest Tea and Gold Peak.

PlantBottle accounts for 30% of Coca-Cola packaging by volume in North America and 7% of its packaging globally. In total, Coca-Cola estimates that PlantBottle has avoided the CO2 emissions of nearly 1 million vehicles since 2009.

Coca-Cola has opened up the technology to non-competing companies for several years. Heinz, for example, has been using the technology for its Tomato Ketchup bottles since 2011. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola also shared the technology with the Ford Motor Company for the fabric interior for Fusion hybrid sedans.

And Coca-Cola says the potential of the PlantBottle technology spans the polyester universe, from carpet through to clothing.

Quincey now says the PlantBottle’s IP will be opened up more broadly in 2019: including to competitors in the beverage industry.

Opening up technology to more companies can help drive the technology forward and broaden its potential, says Coca-Cola.

Only a limited number of suppliers produce the type of biomaterial used to make PlantBottle resin, which adds complexity and cost to the production process.

But Coca-Cola says that by encouraging use of bioPET across the beverage industry and beyond, it can drive demand up - and drive pricing down.",From cars to ketchup: Coca-Cola pledges to make eco tech available to all
"Mexican students are transforming acidic agave waste from tequila production into a nutritious high-fiber flour. “We will create a new product to combat obesity and also have a cleaner Mexico,” they say.",28-Jan-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-latam.com/news/r-d/mexican-students-transform-tequila-by-product-into-fiber-packed-functional-flour/9076988-1-eng-GB/Mexican-students-transform-tequila-by-product-into-fiber-packed-functional-flour_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/01/28/Mexican-students-transform-tequila-by-product-into-fiber-packed-functional-flour,"The tequila and mezcal industries are booming in Mexico.

Exports were worth over USD$1.2 billion in 2016 and the tequila and mezcal industries contributed 1.25% to Mexico’s GDP in the same year.

However, the industry also generates nearly two million tons (1.732m tons) of acidic agave waste pulp (known as bagasse), according to the students behind the Mayahuel project.

Led by two biology students at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Dení Grisel Cruz and Rusty Ramírez, the Mayahuel project aims to upscale this by-product.

“We want to use the agave industry’s residues and transform them into a functional food instead of letting them become [a pollutant],” ​the students told FoodNavigator-LATAM.

The students have launched a crowdfunding campaign on Donadora​​ aiming to raise MXN$35,000 that they will use to buy a pulverizer and solar-powered dehydrator to scale up production.

This machinery will also allow them to pulverize fresh bagasse, which contains the most nutrients, further improving the healthiness of the flour.

The high-fiber content of the flour means it increases the feeling of satiety, helps improve calcium assimilation and is gluten-free.

Manufacturers can use the agave flour to make popular yet high-carb/ GI INDEX products such as bread, tortilla, cookies, chips and pizzas, it could improve the diet quality of many Mexicans without requiring them to change their eating habits.

It can also be blended with other flours.

Although the healthy and functional food market is still nascent, Cruz and Ramírez said there is an increased interest in healthy foods – “especially after what the foods most [commonly] eaten every day have done to their health”, ​they added.

“We want to offer this flour to companies that prepare food so they can deliver healthier alternatives to their consumers and that [consumers] have the opportunity to choose something healthy in the offer present in their daily lives.""​

Cruz and Ramírez hope to launch the agave flour on the market within six months and will begin distribution around Mexico City before expanding to the rest of the country.

The project has already attracted the attention of one big player; last year, Mayahuel was selected as a runner-up in Walmart Mexico's Sustainable Innovation Award​​.

The amount of residue generated by the tequila and mescal industries could cover an area twice the size of Mexico City, according to the students, and while this is disposed of by manufacturers “in safe places​”, the fibers are acidic and acidify the soil, preventing it from being arable.

Another solution used is to burn bagasse as a biofuel but this releases CO2 into the atmosphere.

“We want to be part of sustainable development of Mexico,” ​they say.

According to the students, many Mexicans are unaware of the environmental impact of tequila and mezcal production.

“The tequila and mezcal industries had an accelerated growth in last 20 years, but their ecological impact has only started to be known [in the past] 10 years. Therefore it is a new topic for most of Mexicans yet.”​",Mexican students transform tequila by-product into fiber-packed functional flour
Canadian protein drink Rumble is relaunching this month with new carton packaging.,29-Jan-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/news/processing-packaging/rumble-supershakes-relaunch-with-sig-packaging/9068660-1-eng-GB/Rumble-Supershakes-relaunch-with-SIG-packaging_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/01/29/Rumble-Supershakes-relaunch-with-SIG-packaging,"The idea for Rumble was conceived in 2011 in Canada by co-founder Paul Underhill, before expanding into the US. It is now relaunching with SIG combismileBig 11 fl oz / 330ml carton packaging.

The supershakes line has three flavors: Dutch Cocoa, Coffee Bean, and Vanilla Maple. Each bottle contains 20g of grass-fed protein, 5g of fiber, 2,500mg of Omega-3 fatty acids, and an organic veggie and green tea antioxidant blend.

The drinks are non-GMO, low-sugar and free from gluten, lactose and soy.

The new combismileBig 11oz carton packs are fully recyclable with an ergonomic shape: 'allowing for convenient consumption from the pack with a single-action closure that is leak-proof and tamper evident'. The packages are created from raw cardboard made of pulp from trees from FSC-certified (Forest Stewardship Council), responsibly managed forests and other controlled sources.

Rumble is a member of One Percent for the Planet, donating 1% of its annual sales directly to environmental nonprofits.

“Innovation and sustainability lie at the core of our brand, and as we took the opportunity to renew and improve our formulation, we sought a container that was consistent with these values. We are excited to be relaunching Rumble in the combismile packaging, and hope our customers will love the packaging as much as they do the improved formulation,""​ Underhill said.",Rumble Supershakes relaunch with SIG packaging
The UK’s Crediton Dairy has announced a £12m ($15.8m) investment in 2019 in its flavored and functional milk processing facility.,29-Jan-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/dairyreporter.com/news/manufacturers/crediton-dairy-announces-12m-expansion/9081744-1-eng-GB/Crediton-Dairy-announces-12m-expansion_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/01/29/Crediton-Dairy-announces-12m-expansion,"The investment will see an expansion in the processing capacity and capabilities at the plant in Crediton, Devon.

AB InBev has created a global partnership with Benson Hill Biosystems to develop more productive and sustainable barley varieties.,29-Jan-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/news/r-d/ab-inbev-creates-partnership-to-develop-more-sustainable-barley-varieties/9081844-2-eng-GB/AB-InBev-creates-partnership-to-develop-more-sustainable-barley-varieties_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/01/29/AB-InBev-creates-partnership-to-develop-more-sustainable-barley-varieties,"Barley is one of the most susceptible sectors of the brewing industry to climate change. A 2018 study suggested that severe climate events such as drought and heat could affect global barley yields,​​ with potential average yield losses ranging from 3% to 17% depending on the severity of conditions.

The new partnership will use Benson Hill’s computational platform Breed with ‘CropOS’:​ a platform that brings together machine learning, big data analytics and biological knowledge.

The platform can help researchers predict, select and control desirable traits, bypassing generations of experimentation to bring crop and ingredient improvements to market more quickly.

For example, the ‘predictive power’ of Breed lets producers identify favourable traits – such as taste or pest-resistance – and bring them to market faster.

Gary Hanning, Global Director of Barley Research, AB InBev, said: “Brewing quality beer starts with the best ingredients. That requires a healthy environment and thriving communities. ​

""Benson Hill's powerful Breed application positions us at the forefront of innovation to develop more resilient and sustainable varieties of barley for growers and the best quality malt for our brewers.""​

Benson Hill’s system is already being used by confectionery and food giant Mars to improve the productivity, stress tolerance and climate resilience of cacao trees.

How can computers and data help with crop shortages on the ground? CropOS identifies the most promising genetics for the desired outcome – such as a higher yield, environmental sustainability or enhanced nutrition. With the input of each field trial and each set of data, the platform can learn and predict the best outcomes. This can overtake generations of experimentation.

AB InBev - the world’s largest brewer whose brands include Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois - runs a ‘Smart Barley’ program​​ as part of its 2025 Sustainability Goals. The platform uses data, technology and insights to help barley farmers in the AB InBev supply chain improve the productivity and environmental performance of their farms.

The platform allows farmers to benchmark their progress and share best practice tips across a global network, with around 5,000 farmers participating so far.

The idea is that the platform can help identify gaps or opportunities: for example, data showed that farmers in Mexico tended to over-apply fertilizer.",AB InBev creates partnership to develop more sustainable barley varieties
"Kombucha continues to grow in popularity, capitalizing on trends like fermentation and functional ingredients. It’s also branching out beyond the tea market and into alcohol with hard, beer-alternative options like Flying Embers.",29-Jan-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/article/2019/01/29/flying-embers-expands-hard-kombucha-line/9081116-5-eng-GB/Flying-Embers-expands-hard-kombucha-line_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/01/29/Flying-Embers-expands-hard-kombucha-line,"Created in 2017, the idea for Flying Embers was born out of parent company Fermented Sciences. Founder Bill Moses - the man behind kombucha success story KeVita which was sold to PepsiCo​ in 2016 - saw an opportunity for the popularity of kombucha to ‘naturally’ grow into the alcohol category.

From the fermentation process, all kombucha contains a small amount of alcohol. In the US, a drink that exceeds 0.5% ABV is considered an alcoholic beverage, and most kombucha brands are designed to stay this threshold in order to remain functional, non-alcoholic teas.

But Flying Embers has a 4.5% ABV, on par with most beers and hard ciders. Moses and his team “realized that kombucha naturally wants to go over the legal limit of 0.49%, and there are a lot of people that actually want a healthy alcohol elixir of sorts.”​

Flying Embers is fermented with black tea and a combination of 'adaptogenic botanical roots': a blend of of ginger, turmeric, ashwagandha and astragalus.

The fermentation process for kombucha is flexible on alcohol content. Depending on how it is fermented, it can generate very little alcohol or a significant amount that exceeds the legal limit. Moses says that hard kombuchas are simpler to produce, and many traditional kombucha brands struggle with keeping the ABV at 0.49% or below.

“Unlike KeVita, where we did different things to mitigate and keep the alcohol level below 0.5%, with Flying Embers we do other things to ensure that the fermentation can continue to be elongated to generate more alcohol,”​ Moses said.

Flying Embers contains live probiotics and is sold in three flavors - Ginger & Oak, Ancient Berry, and Lemon Orchard. It’s described as “tangy with an overture of sweetness”​ including a bold flavor that comes from the tea and a tartness from the bacteria. The drinks are USDA-certified organic, vegan and gluten-free.

The brand officially launched in June 2018 and was self-distributed in grocery stores in southern California. It has since expanded to the Reyes Holdings, Columbia Distributing, Crescent Crown and the Sheehan Group for distribution across California, the pacific northwest and New York.

Moses said he is also closing soon on deals in the next two weeks with partners in New England, the eastern seaboard, Texas and Florida.

The customer base for Flying Embers is largely the millennial crowd that is already familiar with kombucha, and skews between 65-70% female. Moses is finding it most popular for daytime drinking occasions on the weekend, when people are looking for an alcoholic option that allows them to enjoy a few without getting too intoxicated.",Flying Embers expands hard kombucha line

Martin de Olde, marketing and business development manager, Food & Speciality metal division, Ardagh, said 3D modelling is a powerful tool in the marketing decision-making process with potentially significant savings on launch timelines.

“In 2016, our 3D studio was built by Turnavisual. At the time this was a good technical platform. However, we realized we needed to keep innovating this platform and ready ourselves for the future (augmented and virtual reality options) as well as offer an appealing platform to customers who do not necessarily have their own 3D software​,” he said.

“The existing software was not able to offer those options and that is why we switched to Webpackaging. They built custom built software for us which is also cloud based​.

“One of the obstacles we faced is that a customer who had created their own 3D model could not easily share this with others. In the new 3D Studio, you can easily share your files with whomever and you do not need to have any design software yourself to be able to view the 3D prototypes.​”

Ardagh handles thousands of artwork projects at its graphic studios, with the enhanced studio, customers can visualize their artwork at the early stage of the packaging development as a 3D model within minutes.

“We have built up a huge design library of different metal packaging formats, from food cans to aerosols, kegs, Easy Peel lids and Easy Open lids to enable our customers to launch and develop their brands​,” added de Olde.

"After 25 years of supplying fresh fruits to supermarkets in Europe, Japan and North America, India’s Freshtrop will move into cold-extracted beverages this year with a new brand, Second Nature.",30-Jan-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/dipti-motiani-founder-and-chief-product-officer-of-second-nature/9077397-1-eng-GB/Dipti-Motiani-Founder-and-chief-product-officer-of-Second-Nature_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/01/30/Indian-fruit-major-Freshtrop-to-break-out-into-cold-extracted-juices,"The Bombay Stock Exchange-listed Maharashtra company will use some of its infrastructure to build the brand under Dipti Motiani, who heads the processing side of the business.

The range of fruit and vegetable, nectars and dairy-free nut milks will be available across Indian metros in 2019, joining a small but growing number of cold-pressed beverage firms.

“In India, there aren’t too many players in the cold extracted segment yet. But we feel that India is a really large market that’s growing. In order to create a category you need multiple players. It’s not too over-crowded yet​,” said Motiani.

The established brands include RAW Pressery, one of the market leaders since 2013 and now with 18 juices. Last year the Mumbai company announced an injection of around US$10m from investors including Silicon Valley’s Sequoia Partners and Indian venture capitalist Saama Capital.

Other cold-pressed juice brands include Just Pressed and MyGreens, of Delhi, and Mumbai-based Juicifix.

Unlike most of its competitors, though, Second Nature will not produce cold-pressed juices. Instead, it will focus on the process of cold-extraction.

By gently extracting juice and pulp in a vacuum, the system sets out to prevent oxidation and the loss of natural flavours. In contrast, cold-pressed juices are extracted using pressure in open atmospheric conditions, causing fibre loss and oxidation, Motiani claims.

“We all know that there is bacteria in the air and there is dust around farms. Second Nature uses the latest high-pressure processing technology to address this by respecting the ingredients and ensuring retention of the nutrition and original flavour of the fruits, vegetables and nuts​,” she said.

Second Nature also intends to engage some of the processes and technologies used by its fresh fruits parent. Nashik-based Freshtrop was established in 1992 and is led by Motiani’s father as managing director. Its core activities lie in harvest management and since 2009 has been involved in fruit processing.

“We’ve learnt a lot and developed systems for processing. Two years ago we decided we’d like to look at the domestic market, and started thinking about how to grow our range​,” she said.

“Freshtrop has always been positioned as a quality supplier, rather than one that trades in great​ volumes. We may not have the quantities that other suppliers have, but we do aspire to have the best quality in any product that we work in or supply​.”

It gets all its fruit and vegetables directly from local farmers, which would typically present a problem in India, where the cold chain and cold service management are “practically non-existent​”.

To mitigate difficulties, Second Nature works directly with growers, training them in the best farming practices and ensuring that the produce they grow meets stringent food safety standards. The brand has also brought in agronomists to teach growers how to ensure that fruits they grow are harvested at exactly the right time. They are then shipped to Second Nature’s factory within hours, where they are put into a temperature-controlled environment.

The plant currently has a capacity of about 36,000, 250ml bottles a day. Motiani estimates it will take three to four years before this capacity will be reached.

“We will try to make it faster​,” she said. “At the same time we have been in the agriculture business for more than two decades, and are not in any kind of hurry.​

“We are self-funded and here for the long term, and we’re not going to create a brand that we will sell off for a profit. We are making sustainable a sustainable business and products that are second to natural​.”

The brand founder intends to stress Freshtrop’s history of international exports and its approach to producing cold-extracted juices in an intensive marketing campaign before the brand’s full launch across Indian metros “in the next couple of months​”. A successful soft-launch took place in 2018.

“When there are multiple players in a category, it does help the consumer to understand about the product. We will be launching an aggressive communications campaign across several media, with digital media being the key​,” she said.

“The consumer will hopefully spend a bit of time reading about and understanding the product. It has to be a mix of outdoor communication, what we do on our digital medium, as well as point of sale and the product itself. It will centre on education of the customer​.”

The brand has spent recent months setting up its supply chain and building relationships with supply partners in Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi. Distribution and supply chain is setting up in a manner that it can scale.

It will market in particular to young and middle-aged working consumers who are either “seeking purity​” or a healthy lifestyle. Modern retail will be central to the brand’s availability, though Second Nature has been investigating e-commerce and online marketplaces like Big Basket and Amazon as well as direct sales from its own website and subscription purchases.

Consumers will find the brand more expensive than other juices, largely because of the cost of maintaining a cold chain at below 5 degrees.

“It could fall into the premium segment, but the experience of a consumer who is wanting a healthy lifestyle, makes a difference. A price of 200-250 rupees per bottle (US$2.80-3.50) is not going to put him off. It’s what we spend for a coffee​,” Motiani said.

“Also, when there are subscriptions and bulk offers where we will be offering better prices as well. When the consumer knows how we are making the product, it closes the loop on the communication. Then price will not affect them, according to our research​.”

In the future Second Nature plans to expand its product range and sales radius to have a presence across India, and possibly overseas. Further down the line, Motiani envisages the brand producing a range of associated fruit and vegetable products, beyond beverages.

“We aren’t just saying it, we have 35 years’ experience with working with fruits and vegetables and the most demanding supermarkets in Europe and America.

The product is available for sale since Monday, January 28.

Hyalmoist lactobacillus (Lactobacillus Gasseri N320), which is the probiotic ingredient present in the product, was selected after the firm had screened 1,000 different bacteria strains.

Hyalmoist lactobacillus works by enhancing the function of human skin cells to produce hyaluronic acid, an ingredient which has shown to improve skin suppleness​.

On top of 20,000mg of Hyalmoist lactobacillus, each bottle which comes in 50ml, also contains 5,000mg of collagen and comes in a fruity peach taste.

A Nissin spokesman said that the company took 2 years and 3 months to develop the new product.

Being one of the most common bacteria found naturally in the human digestive tract, lactobacillus is used in many food products such as yogurt and supplements.

Improvements to the skin condition could be seen after consuming Hyalmoist for eight weeks, according to clinical studies conducted by Nissin two years ago.

One of the studies was conducted from February to May, a period when the humidity level in Japan is especially low.

Involving 44 subjects, the participants were separated into two groups.

One group drank 100ml of Hyalmoist and the other took the placebo for eight weeks.

Results showed that consuming Hyalmoist for eight weeks is able to retain moisture, especially in the cheeks and back areas.

According to another study, Hyalmoist has also shown to reduce skin inflammation arising from exposure to UV rays.

In the study, 70 participants were placed into two groups. One group took Hyalmoist in the form of capsules and the other was only given placebos. The two groups consumed either Hyalmoist or placebos daily for eight weeks.

Both groups were exposed to UV rays. The group which took two capsules of Hyalmoist daily suffered from a smaller degree of skin inflammation and tanning compared to the group which were given placebos.

Hyalmoist is not Nissin’s first attempt to sell a product containing lactobacillus.

Nissin Yoke, the dairy product arm of the company, has started to sell Pilkul lactobacillus drink as early as 1994.

In a financial report dated 2006, the product was described as “selling well”.

At present, the Pilkul series comes in “light”, “multivitamin”, and “calcium” versions, besides the original flavour.

It has also introduced a new product “Thomas Nyusankin”, which is a lactobacillus drink for one year olds and above.

In its latest financial presentation, the revenue of Nissin Yoke was said to have dropped 3%, due to “​the weak yogurt market which caused price competition, despite the strong performance of ‘PILKUL’.”​",From Cup Noodles to nutricosmetics: Japan's Nissin launches probiotic and collagen beauty drink
"Beer dominates the Super Bowl watch party, but wine, hard seltzer and spirits have started creeping into the game day spread. New Nielsen data suggests that an increase in female football fans is shifting demographics, reflected in alcohol choice for the number one sports event in the US.",31-Jan-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/news/retail-shopper-insights/hard-seltzer-sales-triple-for-super-bowl-watch-parties-challenging-beer/9089887-1-eng-GB/Hard-seltzer-sales-triple-for-Super-Bowl-watch-parties-challenging-beer_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/01/31/Hard-seltzer-sales-triple-for-Super-Bowl-watch-parties-challenging-beer,"Super Bowl Sunday hits the US this weekend, a much-anticipated annual event when Americans indulge in football, expensive advertising, halftime concerts, snacks and, of course, alcohol. The Super Bowl has evolved beyond a simple football game into what many people consider a holiday and an excuse to throw parties with friends and family, even without an attachment to the teams playing.

Alcohol is a major part of the day, with beer often the most popular choice for fans. It is cheaper and easier to buy in bulk for parties, and beer’s long history with sporting events is unmatched.

Mainstream domestic brands like Budweiser, Bud Light, Miller Lite and Heineken are the most popular options, but consumers indulge in their favorite craft brews as well. Nielsen reported that more than $166m worth of craft beer was consumed on Super Bowl Sunday 2017.

According to new reports from Nielsen, “wine and spirits both generate nearly half a billion dollars in sales, each, in the two weeks leading up to the Super Bowl,”​ and “59% of Super Bowl fans said they prefer to drink wine, while 55% prefer beer and 49% prefer spirits.”​

The Beer Institute, a Washington DC-based trade association, found in a recent survey that 76% of Americans celebrating the Super Bowl this year plan to drink beer while they watch. Of those drinking beer, 78% said it was an important part of the Super Bowl experience, and half said beer was very important to their Super Bowl celebration.

Jim McGreevy, president and CEO of the Beer Institute, said “Across the country, men and women will take a few hours this Sunday to enjoy good friends, good food, good football, and--of course--good beer.”​

“Our nation’s more than 5,600 brewers and beer importers are proud to be part of Super Bowl Sunday, and they have poured their talent and dedication into making sure each celebrant has the right beer for Sunday’s game and future occasions throughout the year.”​

A changing landscape is thanks in part to the female football fanbase. According to Nielsen, female Super Bowl viewership between 2014-2018 maintained at about 46%-47%. Women also control $4.3 trillion (73%) of US spending, so the adult beverage industry is shifting from male-dominated marketing to more gender-balanced advertising.

Women are more drawn to wine, spirits and hard seltzer than men, leading to a rise in their Super Bowl consumption. Sales of the low-calorie flavored malt beverage (FMB) have more than tripled since Super Bowl 2016, rising from 0.3% to 1.3% in 2018.

Overall, women are 21% more likely to drink hard cider most often compared to other adult beverages. The juicy/hazy style of New England IPAs also has a place in football, driven by female preference (63%) more than male (60%).

Nielsen reports that 11% of female football fans opt for Pinot Grigio, and 38% choose beer as their clear game day favorite. Online wine sales reached $716,792 on Super Bowl Sunday in 2017, but saw a 46% increase to $1,047,993 on Super Bowl Sunday 2018.

“Some Super Bowl staples will last forever: count beer, wings and chips among them. But it’s a much more crowded space than it used to be, and marketers need to take note,”​ Nielsen said.","Hard seltzer sales triple for Super Bowl watch parties, challenging beer"

The two flavors were chosen from a shortlist of 20 options and tested by 2,000 Americans. They join the existing Diet Coke lineup of Ginger Lime, Feisty Cherry, Zesty Blood Orange and Twisted Mango.

Rafael Acevedo, group director, Diet Coke, said: “Flavor variety is key because it provides more points of entry into the brand. Different consumers have different favorites, so it’s important to offer a range. And we’re finding that when new drinkers try a flavor, they’re also more likely to reach for (original) Diet Coke.”​

Diet Coke Blueberry Acai and Strawberry Guava hit shelves in the US in mid-January in sleek 12oz cans.

Diet Coke rebranded in 2018 with a modern new look, sleek packaging, new flavors and a marketing boost to re-energise and contemporise the brand. The restage helped spark a 2018 turnaround for the brand: which posted retail dollar sales growth in Nielsen measured channels for four consecutive quarters after at least five years of decline.

Mark Scialdone, Founder of Cafe Agave, said: “People are drinking better and looking for quality – whether it’s alcohol or coffee.​

“In coffee, they are choosing gourmet blends and new brewing techniques. Cold brewing is at the top of this coffee revolution. The coffee is brewed for 12 hours or more delivering a smoother, less bitter experience than traditional brewing methods and its mass-market appeal is growing exponentially as people continue to discover it. We saw the opportunity to create a new category of beverages that combined two of peoples’ favorite things – gourmet cold brewed coffee and alcohol.” ​

"There are now more than 1,700 drinks certified gluten-free worldwide, and beverage-specific certifications have grown in the last four years.",01-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/gfco-logo/9086485-1-eng-GB/GFCO-logo_large.png,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/01/From-kombucha-to-chocolate-milk-Why-interest-in-gluten-free-is-still-growing,"The Gluten Intolerance Group (GIG) has operated its Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO) program for CPG products since 1974, the largest and fastest-growing standard for gluten-free food in North America.

After the gluten-free trend went mainstream a few years ago, the process of product certification is still going strong. In 2018 GIG certified 2,203 products from 196 brands as gluten-free. In total, more than 52,000 products made by over 2,500 brands in 47 countries have earned the certification worldwide.

GIG began as a family-run organization helmed by dietitian Elaine Hartsook, PhD, RD, who was considered a top international expert in celiac disease. As GIG outlines, ""people with gluten-related disorders cannot tolerate the proteins found in foods containing these grains, and eating them can cause serious health problems, including malnourishment, chronic fatigue and damage to the small intestine.""​

The GFCO program helped those with a gluten intolerance identify safe foods for decades before gluten-free diets hit the mainstream. Yogurt was the first popular category for certification, though beverages are now catching up.

Everything from cheese, tea and tofu have been certified in the last few months, including Big Easy Bucha kombucha, Oatly Oatmilk, Bunny James carrot fries and A’Mond cheddar cheese.

Chris Rich, VP of marketing and development at GIG, said “Consumers today are demanding transparency, accountability and authenticity in food processing, and manufacturers worldwide continue to turn to GFCO’s third-party certification to secure the trust of the gluten-free community. With no cure for celiac disease and gluten intolerance, consumers will continue to demand gluten-free products.”​

Channon Quinn, COO and VP of food safety at GIG, says that the organization is also dealing with an uptick in requests to accommodate consumer preference for transparent and clean labels - and this is something that is becoming increasingly important in the beverage category.

Young people now have a tendency to cycle through several diets​ like gluten-free, paleo, keto and low-sugar: and this influences how they choose their beverages. Being certified gluten-free helps a brand market to this audience.

“Brands want to be able to make a claim and make it safely. They want to jump on that gluten-free bandwagon,”​ Quinn said.

Brands apply for certifications like gluten-free and non-GMO because it’s what the consumer wants to see on their groceries, even with products that may not necessarily need it. There has also been an increase in products marketed toward keto and paleo diets.

“We have turned away companies that do water or something absolutely silly, because those are inherently gluten-free and there’s no benefit to marketing that as gluten-free,” ​Quinn said.

“There’s a lot more awareness among consumers who have a medical condition, it’s not so much the fad push it was a few years ago. I think the fad is what forced consumers to say, ‘get it certified or I’m not buying it.’”​

The certification process is the same across the board regardless of what the product is. GIG has a list of standards that every single manufacturing facility must pass. Then there is an on-site audit to verify the claims, and testing that’s required to be submitted back to GIG on a quarterly basis.

GIG also does its own surveillance testing by purchasing products at retail and analyzing them. It is a similar process to organic, non-GMO, and kosher certifications, and as long as each brand is maintaining the standards, they maintain their gluten-free certification.

A requirement of GFCO is that ""all finished products using the GFCO logo contain 10 ppm or less of gluten, a stricter standard than the labeling requirements of the US, Canada, European Union and many other countries.""​

While it may seem obvious that a juice, tea or milk product is naturally gluten-free, there is much more confusion when it comes to alcohol. Beer is brewed with gluten-containing grains like rye and barley: and so there is a separate market for gluten-free beer alternatives.

Other alcohol such as liquor and hard cider are gluten-free, but the beer market for those with gluten allergies or sensitivities has produced many options. An important distinction that GIG hopes to educate on is the difference between gluten-free and gluten-removed.

According to Quinn, gluten-free beer is made from a naturally gluten-free base like sorghum or brown rice. Because there is never gluten in the product to begin with, manufacturers and consumers can be certain that it is safe for those with an intolerance.

Gluten-removed beer starts brewing with a rye or barley base, then uses an additive that removes a portion of the protein.

“There’s no way that we can validate that the part of the protein that needs to be removed is actually removed. There’s no test that can test for that,”​ Quinn said.

She believes it comes down to the debates about distillation; whether the protein is actually gone or if it is partially consumed and it doesn’t get picked up in tests. But the more educated the market, the bigger the push for verified products will be.

In a study from 2017​, GIG tested the reaction of Celiac blood to gluten-removed beer as opposed to truly gluten-free beer. It found that no blood samples reacted to the gluten-free beer, but about 50% still had a reaction to the gluten-removed beer.

Cynthia Kupper, CEO of GIG, said “The medical and scientific community has not validated or accepted that these low-gluten or gluten-removed beers are safe because available gluten testing methods have not been sufficiently accurate with fermented and hydrolyzed products. That is why we conducted this first-of-its-kind study.”​

Quinn doesn’t think the gluten-free market will fall by the wayside, but that an overall plateau is coming. GIG spends a lot of time educating consumers that living gluten-free isn’t always healthy for everyone, and testing out several fad diets won't do the body any favors.

Ardagh said ‘this footprint adjustment’, combined with its ‘ongoing focus on cost reduction, will enhance its competitiveness, and optimize the effectiveness of its capital investments’.

The company previously noted in its Q4 2017 earnings report​ glass packaging revenue North America declined by 14% to €337m in Q4 compared to the same period the previous year.

It said: “On a constant currency basis revenue was 8% lower, due mainly to lower volumes, in particular in the beer and wine end markets​.

“Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 28% to €61m in Q4, compared with the same period in 2016​.”

A review of its Glass North America division at that time led to closure of its Milford, Massachusetts​ facility; pursuing growth opportunities in stronger performing end markets such as food, wine and spirits; reduction in the mass beer category and revision of its freight and logistics structure.

In addition the company said in its Q2 2018 earnings report in October last year: “We have continued to focus on a broad range of internal initiatives to improve our competitive position. These involve adapting our footprint to best match current and projected market conditions, whilst seeking to target benefits from increased automation, continuous training and greater labour flexibility.​ ​

“Much activity has been under way in the quarter and we have now decided: the furnace at our Ruston, Louisiana, plant, which we suspended in July 2018, will now be permanently closed. Ruston will continue to serve a predominantly local and regional customer base, with a more cost-effective freight configuration.​ ​

“Secondly, our investment to re-deploy beer capacity to serve better-performing end markets such as wine and spirits, enables us to avoid the scheduled rebuilding of one furnace at our Seattle, Washington, plant. This furnace will now be permanently closed around the end of this year.”​ ​

It said in a statement: “These footprint adjustments are intended to underpin the medium and long-term prospects of our North American Glass business.​ ​

“We have previously highlighted how the North American glass industry, including Ardagh, needs to address its labour costs if it is to sustain long-term competitiveness and justify continued investment. This reflects the striking differential in all-in labour costs between North America and other markets, including Europe. We want to work with our colleagues in the coming quarters to secure a competitive and sustainable footprint, from which we can move forward.​ ​

“In the past decade in our European Glass business we have seen the benefits of capacity rightsizing and enhanced flexibility, backed by investment in our asset base. Improved competitiveness has supported a stable footprint and high-quality, skilled jobs, despite considerable economic volatility in the region over the past decade.​ ​

“We are now seeking to do the same in Glass North America and, whilst it has had a challenging year, we will continue to identify and implement additional measures to restore it to appropriate levels of profitability.”​","Ardagh to close Illinois glass production plant, axing 150 jobs"
A survey has revealed that three out of four Norwegians support the introduction of age limits on energy drink sales.,01-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator.com/article/2019/02/01/should-norway-ban-energy-drink-sales-to-kids-ever-increasing-consumption-perceived-a-real-problem/9101465-1-eng-GB/Should-Norway-ban-energy-drink-sales-to-kids-Ever-increasing-consumption-perceived-a-real-problem_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/01/Should-Norway-ban-energy-drink-sales-to-kids-Ever-increasing-consumption-perceived-a-real-problem,"Energy drinks have long been criticised for high levels of caffeine and sugar, and their appeal to children and adolescents.

In Norway, increased consumption has sparked the interest of consumer rights body, the Consumer Council. “The ever-increasing consumption of energy drinks in children and adolescents is perceived as a real problem throughout the population,” ​said the Council’s vice president Gunstein Instefjord in a statement.

According to the results of a 2018 survey, available here in Norwegian​​, half the respondents believed age limit bans should be introduced for the sale of energy drinks to under-18s.

Two out of five said that a statutory limit of 16-years-of-age should be implemented, and a majority stated that energy drinks should be placed in a separate aisle to mineral water.

“The survey shows that all sections of the population see the consequences of high-caffeinated energy drinks having taken a strong hold [in] large groups of children and young people,” ​Instefjord continued.

According to Energy Drinks Europe, a sales ban on energy drinks would be arbitrary, discriminatory and not effective. “A better approach is for governments to ensure a fact-based discussion rather than proposals based on conjecture,”​ Energy Drink Europe secretary general Andreas Kadi told FoodNavigator. “Effective measures to address caffeine intake - from all sources - would include portion control and serving size reductions.”​

Currently in Norway, some retail stores have implemented voluntary age limit bans. However, the Consumer Council, which led the survey, highlighted the importance of establishing a blanket rule for all. “This will make the workday easier for those who sell energy drinks, who will then not have to take different trade-offs when young people..buy,” ​said Instefjord.

Norway’s Ministry of Health and Care Services will consider ways in which it can protect children and adolescents from excessive energy drink consumption later this year. “The Consumer Council has expectations that the health authorities will meet the social challenge with good and effective measures in 2019,”​ Instefjord added.

With sugar content of around 10 teaspoons – almost the daily maximum limit for children – and caffeine content comparable to a cup of coffee, awareness of potential health risks associated with energy drink consumption is spreading across Europe.

Indeed, EU legislation requires drinks with more than 150 mg of caffeine per litre to state ‘High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breast-feeding women’.

While voluntary age bans exist in a number of countries, Lithuania and Latvia have implemented bans on energy drinks to under-18s, and in Sweden, some energy drinks are restricted to sale in pharmacies and cannot be sold to under-15s.

The UK investigated a similar approach in its proposal to ban the sale of energy drinks to children under 16 years of age. If approved, the legislation would prevent all retailers from selling drinks with more than 150 mg of caffeine per litre to children. The government is currently analysing responses to its consultation, which closed 21 November 2018.",Should Norway ban energy drink sales to kids?

"Budweiser is now brewed with 100% renewable electricity in Canada, as the brand works towards its goal of having all beer brewed with renewable electricity by 2025.",04-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/budweiser-canada-renewable-electricity/9105178-1-eng-GB/budweiser-canada-renewable-electricity_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/04/Budweiser-switches-to-100-renewable-electricity-in-Canada,"In Canada, Budweiser has partnered with Direct Energy, one of North America’s largest retail providers of electricity and natural gas, to receive ECOLOGO Certified Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs).

Budweiser’s renewable electricity in Canada is being sourced from renewable biomass, hydroelectric and wind power sources.

Todd Allen, vice president of marketing, Labatt Breweries of Canada, said: ""Beer is intimately tied to the environment it comes from and brewing our beer relies on a healthy environment.​

""Through this initiative, we can make sure that every watt we use to brew Budweiser helps green Canada's electricity grid and contributes to our long-term business sustainability.""​

Direct Energy sources its RECs from renewable electricity projects across Canada. The quantity of renewable electricity represented by the RECs supplied to Budweiser will be around 25,870 MWh annually: the equivalent of powering 2,323 homes. In British Columbia, home of Budweiser's Creston brewery, Direct Energy will provide RECs generated through biomass. In Alberta, where Budweiser has a brewery in Edmonton, Direct Energy will provide RECs from hydroelectric sources and is also looking at using wind power sources. In Central and Eastern Canada (where breweries are located in London, Ontario; Montreal, Quebec; Halifax, Nova Scotia; and St. John’s, Newfoundland) Direct Energy is providing RECs sourced from hydroelectric generators in Quebec. ""To brew the perfect beer, we need a mixture of energy – both electricity and heat. Nearly one third of our brewing energy comes from electricity, while the rest comes from heat,""​ says Budweiser. ""The heat for the brewing process comes from a mixture of energy sources including natural gas, which we are still dependent on. However, we have been looking at using low carbon sources such as biogas and landfill gas to help reduce our natural gas usage.""​

In 2017 AB InBev set out goals to secure all its purchased electricity from renewable sources by 2025​,​ reducing the company’s operational carbon footprint by 30%.

The Budweiser brand already uses a 100% Renewable Electricity symbol in the US to show that the equivalent of the electricity used to brew the beer in the US each year is now sourced from wind power​​. In the UK, Budweiser is transitioning to solar power​​ and will also feature the 100% renewable electricity symbol.",Budweiser switches to 100% renewable electricity in Canada

In acquiring 100% of Sufferfest, it makes its first-ever acquisition: citing shared values, a commitment to innovation and common goals as the basis of the partnership.

Sufferfest targets an active audience: and Sierra Nevada identifies the brewery as “at the front of the wave of ‘functional’ alcoholic beverages.”​

Sufferfest was launched in 2016 by long-distance trail runner Caitlin Landesberg, who was looking for the ‘perfect post-sweat beer for herself and fellow sufferers’. After taking a homebrewers course in 2012, followed by coursework at UC Davis, she started sampling her beer with fellow athletes. It is now a Certified B Corporation.

Sufferfest’s brews are gluten-removed, containing less than 5 parts per million gluten. Beers include Kolsch, a 95-calorie beer brewed with bee pollen, and its FKT (Fastest Known Time) Pale Ale brewed with salt and blackcurrant. The company’s beers are available at retailers, restaurants, run and bike shops, climbing gyms and CrossFit boxes in California and Colorado.

Caitlin, Landesberg, founder, said: “Sierra Nevada not only possesses the operational and manufacturing muscle we need to grow Sufferfest, but also is so aligned with Sufferfest in terms of values: sustainability, conservation, and a deep love of the outdoors. They are masters of their craft, and we have a lot to learn from them.​​

“The most exciting thing here is the vote of confidence in our ability to change the craft beer landscape. We’ve spent the last few years doing things differently, and it speaks volumes to the power of what we’re building that we were able to secure the partnership of Sierra Nevada, a leader in the craft beer space.​

“This partnership with Sierra Nevada enables us to do more of what we love: brew award-winning, functional beer, grow our tribe, and be in the hands of sweaty consumers all over the country.”​",Sierra Nevada acquires fellow craft brewer Sufferfest Beer Company
"Manufacturers and retailers of sweetened fermented yoghurt drinks are the focus of Public Health England’s most recent guidance, which incites a 20% reduction of added sugar by 2021.",05-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/phe/9112490-1-eng-GB/phe_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/05/UK-challenges-drinking-yoghurt-industry-to-cut-sugar-by-20,"Public Health England (PHE), the body that advises the British government on public health policy for all of the UK, has expanded its sugar reduction guidelines to include sweetened fermented yoghurt drinks.

The category covers drinking yoghurt, kefirs, lassis, drinks with disease risk-reducing claims, including plant stanols and sterols, and pre and probiotics drinks, including those with functional health claims.

According to the voluntary guidelines​​, all players in this category, including retailers, manufacturers, and businesses that provide drinks for consumers out of the home, are encouraged to reduce added sugar content by 20% over the next three years.

This can be attained by changing recipes, reducing the number of calories in a single portion size, and by encouraging consumers to opt for products with low or no added sugar.

“Industry is encouraged to focus sugar reduction for the top-selling products in the fermented (yoghurt) drinks category and/or reduce their portion size,” ​wrote PHE in the guidance.

“This will drive a reduction in sugar and calorie intakes as these products are consumed more regularly and contribute more sugar and calories to the diet.”​

Public Health England will monitor industry progress in September of this year, with progress reports to be published annually between 2020 until 2022.

Plain and unsweetened yoghurt drinks have been exempt from the guidance, and PHE has made an allowance for naturally occurring sugar.

This accounts for a lactose content (the sugar naturally found in milk) of 3.8 g per 100 ml of fermented yoghurt drink. The sales weighted average (SWA) total sugar guidelines is therefore based on a 20% reduction of the added sugar content, rather than 20% of total sugar.

With regard to maximum calorie intake, the PHE recommends the total number consumed on a single occasion be set at 300 calories by 2021.

Poor diet and nutrition are recognised as major contributory risk factors for ill health and premature death in the UK, which reports an adult obesity level of 27%.

The PHE’s supplementary recommendations have therefore been welcomed by nutrition-focused charity Action on Sugar. “We are pleased to see the publication of this report on yoghurt drinks,” ​Action on Sugar nutritionist Kawther Hashem told FoodNavigator.

“This is because this category of drink is in growth and ensuring there are no increases in the levels of sugar in products is vital.”​

The supplementary report forms part of PHE’s recommendations to the food industry to cut sugar in 10 categories by 20% by 2020.

Fermented drinking products is recognised as a sub category within the yoghurts and fromage frais sector of the reformulation programme, which also targets breakfast cereals; biscuits; cakes; morning goods; puddings; ice creams, lollies and sorbets; confectionery and sweet spreads.

When PHE launched the recommendations in 2016, it told industry it wanted to see a 5% reduction by the end of the first year.

The report tracking industry's progress during that first year, published in May 2018, revealed varying results​​. Compared to the baseline year (2015), yoghurt and fromage frais product had reduced sugar by 6%, and manufacturers of breakfast cereals and sweet spreads had cut added sugar by 5%.

However, industry had fallen short on sugar reduction targets in certain categories. In the biscuits and chocolate confectionery, for example, no change in sugar levels was recorded. Sweet confectionary reduced sugar content by just 1%, while added sugar levels in puddings increased by 1%.",UK challenges drinking yoghurt industry to cut sugar by 20%
"Sparkling botanical blend Petal - a cross between herbal tea, soda and functional water - has reformulated its core line of drinks less than a year after launching in May 2018.

These flavors are now re-launching with 10 calories per 12oz can.

Elderberry White Tea Flower, Lemongrass Dandelion (with a hint of strawberry) and Peach Marigold (with a hint of basil) are the latest flavors to join the product lineup, with 15 calories per can. Each flavor also contains about 3g of sugar.

Founder and CEO of Petal Candice Crane told BeverageDaily that the old formula needed updating to accommodate a wider range of palates, eliminating an aftertaste.

“Sometimes consumers find stevia polarizing because it can leave quite an aftertaste. It’s not necessarily bad, but some people don’t like it. So we wanted to make the drink a little more gulpable,”​ she said.

The main pillar of the Petal brand is its emphasis on botanicals. Crane described them as ancient elixirs and remedies that have been passed on throughout the ages, and Petal is trying to revive them in a modern way.

Crane said it is sometimes a challenge to find and source organic ingredients, and the company spends a lot of time developing a supply chain that meets their needs and standards. They launched locally in Chicago last year with two small distributors.

“We’re the perfect fit for natural stores, but it’s funny that conventional stores are really driving the natural sector. They’re sick and tired of being second to market and following the natural channels,”​ she said.

“We’ve had a ton of conventional retailers reach out to us because they don’t want to miss the boat on bringing in the natural and forward-thinking brands. It’s quite exciting to see the shift in the way people are buying and how conscious they are about healthier beverages and food.”​

The newly revamped Petal products launched last month at the Winter Fancy Food Show in San Francisco in partnership with World Finer Foods. They will act as Petal’s master distributor and also handle sales and marketing tasks.

World Finer Foods CEO Susan Guerin said, ""I was instantly drawn to Petal’s fresh and innovative beverage concept. The brand’s packaging pops off the shelf. We look forward to bringing Petal to consumers across the US, wherever they shop.”​

According to Crane, World Finer Foods has network of brokers throughout the country, and with them Petal plans to expand into new regions and into larger, strategic retailers. The beverages are also sold online at Amazon.com, with more digital channels in the works.

“We feel that Petal sits at the intersection of two large segments, flavored sparkling water and functional beverages. We’re a combination of both of those segments, and our ambition is to lead and own the sparkling botanicals category,”​ she said.",Petal ditches stevia after finding it ‘polarizing’ with consumers
"Brooklyn Crafted (BC) has built its New York brand with its own spin on ginger ale, drawing on the gutsy flavors from its Chinese roots. It’s now exploring other exotic flavors with a new calamansi citrus drink.",05-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/news/ingredients/from-gutsy-ginger-to-calamansi-citrus-brooklyn-crafted-explores-asian-flavors/9091045-1-eng-GB/From-gutsy-ginger-to-calamansi-citrus-Brooklyn-Crafted-explores-Asian-flavors_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/05/From-gutsy-ginger-to-calamansi-citrus-Brooklyn-Crafted-explores-Asian-flavors,"BC has a beverage portfolio of ginger beer, ginger ale, and teas inspired by southeast Asian fruit flavors not often found in Western drinks. All products are manufactured with a ginger base in an homage to the company's Chinese culture, even though Brooklyn Food & Beverage (BFB) has distinct roots in New York as an American company.

It's made its name by introducing unique flavors and a modernized ginger ale to the US and it manufactures the BC brand, which formed in 2018. The first product launched under the BFB umbrella was the Bruce Cost Ginger Ale (BCGA) in 2011, and all subsequent flavors and formulas were developed from the original BCGA recipe.

Over the last eight years BCGA has grown beyond local distribution in the New York metro area to national recognition. It’s made with fresh, unfiltered ginger, including tiny ginger particles.

The Ginger Ale is designed to be enjoyed alone or as a mixer with cocktails, sold in flavors like Jasmine Tea and Passionfruit. A ginger ale most closely resembles a soda product, and is carbonated and sweetened like one.

Ginger beers, on the other hand, are traditionally brewed and fermented like alcohol. They are not typically alcoholic, but have a spicier, more ginger-forward flavor than ales. In 2018 BFB launched the BC brand with the Ginger Beer products in New York City.

The Ginger Beers also use whole, unfiltered ginger in the formula as well as organic ginger extract. They are described as having a more ‘adult mouth feel of a beer or wine.’ The line is available in Classic, Sugar-Free, Extra Spicy, Mango, Lemon Lime and Earl Grey.

Flavor decisions behind BFB comes from the founding family, who are Chinese immigrants. Drawing inspiration from their culture and frequent travels resulted in a beverage company that puts the most functional ingredients first in innovation.

The average ginger ales on the US market are sweeter and less ginger-heavy than what BFB expected, so they set out to explore putting ginger at the forefront of a beverage and modernizing and reinventing the concept of ginger ale

Marcia Hu, marketing manager at BFB, told BeverageDaily, said “Historically, ginger as an ingredient has Chinese roots. Our CEO initially started off in the Chinese food business, so ginger has always been a really integral part of his culture and his cuisine.”​

In line with this ideal is BC’s newest launch--the Calamansi drink. Calamansi fruit is a citrus that originates from southeast Asia, a cross between a kumquat and a mandarin orange. Though not ginger-focused, Hu said BC plans to include a little ginger in all upcoming launches to see if it amplifies the flavor and keep everything on trend.

There is also a new line of herbal teas from BC that comes in five flavors, which contains small amounts of ginger as well. Finally, BC is toying with a lightly sweetened cinnamon apple beverage, expected to be completed later this year.

“Prior to creating this herbal tea line, a lot of the ginger-based drinks they were making appealed to a largely Western audience,”​ Hu said. “Herbal teas are Chinese in origin, but the target for this is definitely not just people who have a connection to Asian culture.”​

Both the teas and the Calamansi drink are being distributed locally in New York before rolling out to national partners.

“The entire mantra behind BC as a company is about drawing on unique flavors and ingredients from around the world that currently don’t exist in the mainstream American market,”​ Hu said.

BC has found its audience mainly with millennials who care about what they’re drinking and where these products are coming from. Hu said the company is fully transparent on the ingredients, sourcing naturally and never using preservatives.

The transparent supply chain is especially in demand within Brooklyn and Manhattan neighborhoods that are thriving with young people, interested in buying local items and supporting local businesses.

A main selling point to consumers is BC’s authenticity as a Brooklyn-born-and-bred company. Other brands may claim to be from New York City, but few actually manufacture and package their products within city limits.

BC’s Bushwick warehouse takes care of every step of the process, and maintaining a presence in Brooklyn is important to the company. Right now BFB is a manufacturer and a distributor, but it will soon also be a co-packer.

The new arm of the business will work with any beverage companies that are based in New York City, looking for a facility to bottle their products. It’s working with partners now and will be launching the service by March.",From gutsy ginger to calamansi citrus: Brooklyn Crafted explores Asian flavors
A Spanish start-up has formulated a recovery drink made from 20% seawater that it says is designed to replenish stores following intense exercise or after “a crazy night out”.,05-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/gettyimages-511995284/9113853-1-eng-GB/GettyImages-511995284_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/05/Functional-recovery-drink-boasts-20-seawater-The-taste-is-like-Gatorade-but-a-bit-salty,"Refix’s recovery drink does not contain added sugar, preservatives or colouring agents, and its 250ml recyclable glass bottles hold just 3.5 calories.

Of particular interest, however, is how this Spanish start-up sets itself apart within the clean label market. According to co-founder Raúl Anta, who launched in the start-up with his brother in 2016, the answer lies in the ingredients list: spring water, lemon juice, stevia, and…20% seawater.

The seawater in Refix’s beverage is sourced from Galicia, on Spain’s north-west coast, which Anta claims is one of the most biologically productive coastlines in the world.

Drinking seawater provides multiple health benefits, Anta suggested. According to the founder, consumption can help modulate the metabolism of glucose, regulate blood cholesterol levels, and relieve fatigue after exercising.

“The reason that we use seawater is that [it] has the same mineral salts as our blood, but in a high concentration,” ​explained Anta. “We mix one past seawater with four parts spring water, in order to get the same concentration of minerals salts that [the] human body [has].” ​

Refix was not the first to leverage the health properties of seawater for human consumption. Originally, “it was a French discovery,” ​Anta explained, adding that nowadays tennis player Rafael Nadal drinks seawater to replenish his mineral salt reserves after exercise.

Despite the Spanish tennis champion’s reported consumption of seawater, the ingredient is relatively new to the beverage sector. Traditionally, “people use seawater to cook fish, but not to drink. It’s something very new,” ​said Anta.

This, in part, is why Refix is looking to expand distribution to more ‘innovative’ countries, we were told. The start-up currently sells its product in Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland and Slovenia, and exports to the US, which represents its largest customer base.

“We want to sell in Northern Europe,” ​said Anta, adding that Scandinavian countries are more open to innovative drinks than his native country. “Spain, as a country, drinks ‘typical’ drinks – such as Gatorade or Coca-Cola. It is not an innovative country.” ​

Refix markets its drink as having a double function: The drink can help to relieve fatigue after exercising, and, according to Anta, after “a crazy night out – as it helps to alkalize and reduce acid levels”. ​

Drinking two bottles of Refix before going to sleep is the “best option to eliminate [a] hangover produced by alcohol”, ​the co-founder claimed. “When you drink alcohol, you eliminate it via your lungs…a lot of water is [eliminated] by the urine, and that urine has a lot of mineral salts,” ​he explained.

However, if you drink 20% seawater mixed with 80% spring water, you recover the same mineral salts, in the same concentration, that you lose in urine, he added.

Refix describes the taste of its recovery drink as similar to Gatorade, “but a bit salty”. ​However, a similar flavour profile doesn’t automatically place Refix in the sports recovery beverage market, according to Anta.

“We don’t have competitors,” ​he told us. “We don’t compare [ourselves] with Gatorade or Powerade, and while there are two or three brands [in Spain] that use seawater, we don’t [see them as] competitors because they use just 3-4% seawater.​

“You need to use 20-25% seawater to make a functional drink. Less than that and you don’t notice the benefits.”​","'Functional recovery' drink boasts 20% seawater: ‘The taste is like Gatorade, but a bit salty’"

It produces 115,000 bottles of spirits every year, with distribution across 11 states in the US and Japan.

Its sales have more than tripled since 2014, winning awards such as USA Today’s ’10 best craft distilleries’ and NASDAQ Stock Market’s 2016 list of ‘Next great consumer brands’.

Constellation Brands made the investment though its venture capital group: a division that identifies and invests in premium, emerging brands. Constellation has made several craft acquisitions in the US recent years: including whiskey brand High West Distillery​​ and brewers Ballast Point​, ​Funky Buddha Brewery​ ​and Four Corners Brewing.​​

Black Button’s spirits are distilled from New York State grains, and then aged, bottled and labeled in Rochester. It prides itself on using natural ingredients from local farms (over 90% of ingredients are grown or produced in New York State).

The company was the first grain-to-glass craft distillery in Rochester since Prohibition, and now has a tasting room and retail store offering spirits tastings, distillery tours and craft cocktails.

Black Button – which is behind spirits such as Straight Bourbon Whiskey, Citrus Forward Gin, seasonal Lilac Gin and Bespoke Bourbon Cream - will continue to manage, produce, market and sell its spirits. At the moment these are distributed throughout New York State, in select markets in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic (most notably New York, New Jersey, Maryland and DC).

Jason Barrett, founder, said the company needed to find an equity partner in order to grow at the rate it believes it is capable of.

“We found a partner right in our back yard. Constellation shares our love of Western NY and they are also committed to the agricultural roots that are so important to Black Button.”​

Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Roy Blunt (R-MO) are co-sponsoring the bill to “level the playing field for craft beverage makers.”,12-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/article/2019/02/12/new-craft-beverage-bill-excites-the-cider-industry/9135764-1-eng-GB/New-craft-beverage-bill-excites-the-cider-industry_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/12/New-craft-beverage-bill-excites-the-cider-industry,"The announcement came late on February 6, in the midst of the cider industry’s seventh annual CiderCon expo in Chicago. The CBMTRA bill​ will give cidermakers a chance to build on the ‘critical progress’ made in 2018 by re-calibrating federal excise taxes and streamlining regulations on alcohol producers.

Michelle McGrath, executive director at USACM, said “Senators ​[Wyden and Blunt] have been working really hard to make this a permanent federal excise tax reform. It expands the definition of small producers so that we can start leveling the playing field for cider.”​

“Much of the cider category's growth is attributable to the excise tax credits these companies are now receiving. Small cideries are expanding their staff and operations in a direct response. The industry can continue to support manufacturing, neighborhood renewal projects, rural economies, and orchardists, but we need these credits to stick around on a permanent basis to do so.”​

If passed, the bill will permanently establish reduced taxes and modernized regulations for brewers, cider makers, vintners and distillers to further promote job creation in each industry, as well as maintain funding for critical TTB programs.

Senator Wyden addressed attendees at CiderCon last week, encouraging the recent growth of the industry and promising “to make sure that that keeps happening.”​

He said: “You’ve shared with me the tax credits have meant new equipment for expansion, and new, good-paying jobs. I want you to know that your lawmakers are working with me to help cider workers everywhere. Thank you for your devotion to your craft, supporting our economy, and the work you do. I hope that at CiderCon 2020 we’ll be able to celebrate the passage of the CBMTRA,”​ he said.

According to the bill, the brewing industry alone contributed more than $350bn to the US economy in 2016, directly and indirectly employing about 2.23 million Americans. Cider sales alone have increased by about 500% since 2011.

Anne Hubatch, co-owner of Alter Ego Cider and VP of the Northwest Cider Association, said “The ​[CBMTRA] has made real and lasting impacts to my small business. As a micro-craft cidery, this act helps us to save on our excise taxes which in turn keep more money in the business to grow and invest in more staff and equipment.""​

There are now more than 900 cideries in the US following 2018’s ‘year of expansion’. About 100 cideries opened their doors and there is now at least one cidery in 48 states. Nielsen reports that cider is 10 times bigger now than it was 10 years ago, despite stagnant alcohol consumption overall.

McGrath said, “We're hopeful to once more see broad bipartisan support for making these credits permanent with the CBMTRA. The margins are so tight in cider that many family-owned cideries are literally depending on it.""​

The United States Association of Cider Makers (USACM) has also been working on establishing a dialogue with the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) about labeling restrictions on cider packaging.

Under current legislation, the cider industry is regulated as a subcategory of wine. It’s not brewed like beer, but fermented using apples in a process similar to the way wine is made from grapes.

Cidermakers are hoping to educate the TTB about the key, fundamental differences between it and other forms of alcohol in order to be categorized with its own set of regulations.

For example, cidermakers cannot list the place of origin, or use harvest dates, on ciders over 7% ABV. Cideries want to change this restriction designed for vineyard protection in the wine industry.",New craft beverage bill excites the cider industry
"Consuming one liter per day of yerba maté – but not green tea – may increase levels of an antioxidant enzyme linked to HDL (good) cholesterol for obese and overweight people, says a new study from Brazil.",10-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/nutraingredients-latam.com/news/research/yerba-mate-may-boost-antioxidant-levels-for-overweight-and-obese-people-study/9130668-1-eng-GB/Yerba-mate-may-boost-antioxidant-levels-for-overweight-and-obese-people-Study_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/10/Yerba-mate-may-boost-antioxidant-levels-for-overweight-and-obese-people-Study,"Data from an eight week randomized clinical trial indicated that yerba maté consumption was associated with 10% increases in antioxidant enzyme paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), which is closely related to high density lipoprotein (HDL), compared to control (apple tea) and green tea.

A reduction in leptin levels was also recorded in the maté group, reported researchers led by Guilherme Balsan and Vera Lúcia Portal from the University Cardiology Foundation – IC/FUC.

“The daily intake of one liter of yerba mate for eight weeks in subjects affected by overweight or obesity and dyslipidemia increased their antioxidant capacity through the elevation of serum levels of PON-1 and associated positively with the increase of the HLD-c, stressing the protective role of this compound against atherosclerotic disease,”​ wrote the researchers in the Nutrition Journal​​.

“[T]he reduction in leptin levels in the YM group was significantly related to reduction of insulin and BMI. ​

“These results demonstrate the antioxidant role of yerba mate and its possible benefits in glycemic metabolism and in the control of body weight.”​

Yerba maté (Illex paraguariensis​) is a tea-like drink traditionally consumed in South American countries by pouring boiling water onto a high concentration of leaves. The active ingredients of the beverage include polyphenols and caffeoyl derivatives, such as caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and different forms of dicaffeoylquinic acid. Yerba maté also contains phytosterols and saponins.

The beverage has been garnering increased attention outside of South America thanks to the global appeal of soccer stars from Latin America like Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez of Barcelona.

The new study looked at the potential benefits for mitochondrial biogenesis and thermogenesis.

The Brazilian researchers recruited 142 overweight or obese men and women aged between 35 and 60 years to participate in their trial. The participants were randomly assigned to receive one liter per day of yerba maté, green tea, or apple tea (control) for eight weeks.

Results showed that participants in the yerba maté group experienced increases in antioxidant capacity linked to greater levels of PON-1, and this was positively associated with increased levels of HDL-cholesterol.

On the other hand, green tea consumption did not impact PON-1 or leptin, said the researchers.

“Epidemiological and cohort studies provided convincing evidence on the protective paper of PON-1 against artery disease, through its ability to prevent lipid oxidation and limit the development of atherosclerotic lesion due to its connection with HDL,” ​explained the researchers. “In the present study, the variation in the levels of PON-1 also presented significant association with HDL. This result reinforces the fact that PON-1 is closely associated with HDL, promotes the inhibition of LDL oxidation and decreases oxidized lipids in atherosclerotic lesions. ​

“It is also an evidence of the antioxidant activity of yerba mate in humans, resulting in increased levels of the enzyme and a positive interaction with HDL. ​

“These results suggest that yerba mate and other nutritional antioxidants, by a mechanism not yet fully elucidated, improve levels of antioxidant enzyme PON-1 and can protect against cardiovascular events.”​

The researchers called for additional larger studies to confirm these results.

"Brazil's beverage market has been declining for the past three years, according to Kantar Worldpanel. ""The market in Brazil is significant, complex and experiencing challenging times. However, there are opportunities to grow,"" it says.",31-Jan-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/aerial-view-of-lots-of-coffees-rawpixel/9094985-1-eng-GB/aerial-view-of-lots-of-coffees-Rawpixel_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/01/31/How-to-find-growth-in-Brazil-s-declining-drinks-market,"For the past three years, the beverages market in Brazil has performed behind total fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), shrinking its size from 15% to 14.6%.

A recent report​ by market research agency Kantar Worldpanel, however, identifies important areas manufacturers should consider in order to build a strategy and find growth in the category.

Dairy-based drinks are declining the most, followed by cold drinks. Beer and coffee, on the other hand, are on the rise, enjoying year-on-year growth of more than 5%. The Kantar report does not explore the reasons behind the decline in Brazil’s dairy drink sector but it does show which categories are driving the decline. The two biggest categories in terms of size, UHT milk and powdered milk, have both registered a decline of more than 3%, as have flavored milk, fresh milk and soymilk. Bucking this trend and growing by more than 5%, however, are fermented milks and liquid yogurts.

Firstly, brands need to begin by understanding purchase intent, says report author and global beverage market analyst, George Moore. “Only when you understand the motivation of the consumer, you can build a strategy to target growth in the beverages market,” ​he writes.

Pinpointing when consumers drink certain beverages, for instance, can help manufacturers identify their true competitor.

“We typically identify competitors from within our market or category. However, we should consider the wider threat from other beverage markets that are present at the same consumption moment,” ​said Moore.

A cup of coffee and a drinking yogurt may seem worlds apart in terms of taste and other sensory characteristics, but they are both popular drinks for breakfast. This makes them potential competitors, according to Kantar Worldpanel.

Similarly, cold drinks and beer could be seen as competing products during main meals.

“To truly explore competition, we must also consider the reason behind the occasion. This shows that beer is more likely to be consumed for pleasure and therefore features more at the weekend compared to cold beverages, where the reason is out of habit and feature more in the week.​

""To understand your competitor in the beverage market, you must understand categories that compete at the same occasion and for the same reason. ​

At this point, manufacturers can directly appeal to shoppers by communicating about how their product is suited to a particular occasion.

So what strategies can a manufacturer use to pair its beverage to a particular eating occasion – such as the classic combo ‘beer and barbecue’ –­ apart from advertising?

“I have two thoughts here​,” Moore told FoodNavigator-LATAM. “Firstly is cross-category promotions, which is quite a common practice in the UK.”​

In the retail space, this is when a supermarket offers a lunchtime ‘meal deal’, offering a sandwich or salad, a drink, and a snack (such as a yogurt or a piece of fruit) for a fixed price. In the evenings, the meal deal format might be tweaked to include a ready meal starter, ready meal main course, dessert and a bottle of wine.

“Manufacturers have found growth by being added to part of the meal deal, such as coconut water,” ​Moore said.

“The second option would be through in-store display. Another common practice is to see varying products placed together to again provide a meal solution. Both examples show how beverages have been paired with main meals.” ​

Out of home sales have a higher value

According to Moore, beverage brands should also have two separate strategies to drive sales: one for in-home purchases and another for out-of-home.

Out-of-home sales represent 40% of Brazil's total beverage market value and are currently enjoying a 7.6% growth rate, with beer and cold drinks performing well. Out-of-home products also have a “far higher​” average price per liter, said the analyst.

To win in the out-of-home sector, where, he advises manufacturers to consider alternative pack formats that favor smaller servings.

“Beverage manufacturers need to ensure that they are well placed to take the opportunity in the in- and out-of-home markets, by being present in both impulse and food channels and with an adequate portfolio to match each occasion,” ​writes Moore.

“The final consideration is that [growth] can only be achieved through retail activation. To reiterate the point that the biggest brands, are those chosen the most often, this can only be true if the product is physical available for shoppers to buy.​

“Building a portfolio of brands to target varying shoppers and occasions, tailoring assortment to relevant channel and being regionally diversified can help you reach more shoppers at more occasions.”​",How to find growth in Brazil’s declining drinks market

Increased demand for fortified drinks – along with the emergence of new technologies which increase productivity – are helping make beverages the fastest growing sector in the F&B processing machinery market in the US.,14-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/pmmi-infographic-key-trends-driving-processing-machinery-technology/9131415-1-eng-GB/PMMI-infographic-key-trends-driving-processing-machinery-technology_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/14/Fortified-drinks-and-new-technology-drive-growth-in-beverage-machinery-market-PMMI,"In its 2018 PMMI Food & Beverage Processing Machinery Report, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies (PMMI) identifies 4.2% CAGR (2016-2021) growth in the US beverage machinery market.

While an increased focus on healthier beverages is driving the market forward, the decline in carbonated soft drinks has also prompted beverage processors to be more innovative with packaging in order to attract consumers back to the category.

Variety is still the spice of life​

The value of the overall US market for US food and beverage processing machinery was estimated at $5.3bn in 2016, with revenues forecast to grow at 2.8% CAGR (2016-2021) to reach $6.1bn in 2021.

Of the subsectors, the beverage machinery market is one of the most impressive: it is the second largest (after meat and poultry) worth $0.8bn. And the beverage revenues are forecast to grow the fastest: with a CAGR of 4.2%, which is considerably faster than the overall industry.

PMMI tracks continued demand for diversity and fast turnover times in beverage processing and packaging lines.

“The high demand for variety in beverages drives investment in processing machinery,” ​it says. “Consumers are increasingly demanding new products for different occasions and times of the day in many types of drink. ​

""Because of the diversity of the beverage industry, there is typically a shorter machinery lifecycle, as demand continuously changes for modified and new products, resulting in relatively frequent investment in machinery for the production of new, alternative, or modified products.​

“The industry is highly competitive with the top 50 largest companies holding a market share of half of the industry’s revenue. Small beverage processing machinery manufacturers are competing in local markets by delivering more efficient and higher quality products while ensuring the efficiency of the end product in the market.”​

As consumers look for healthier and functional options, fortified drinks are one of the key drivers of growth, according to PMMI.

“The US beverage processing market is witnessing strong growth in fortified drinks, resulting in an increase in demand for filtration machineries, as this equipment is required during the production of beverages such as soft drinks, beer, and juices for filtering and separation processing. ​

“Demand for filtration machinery, shift towards alternative beverage products, changing customer preferences for healthier drinks; and the demand for non-carbonated beverages such as juices, sport drinks, and energy drinks are increasing at a higher pace due to health awareness, as these non-carbonated beverages contain few calories”.​

As consumers turn away from carbonated soft drinks, beverage processors have had to be inventive in order to encourage consumers spending: with new packaging designs or new smaller pack sizes, observes the Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies (PMMI).

“For instance, reducing the size of cans from 12-oz to 8-oz and selling it as a premium per-ounce rate coupled with consumers’ preference for smaller-sized cans has increased spending in this area.”​",Increased demand for fortified drinks spurs growth in beverage machinery market: PMMI
Former Denver Broncos running back Terrell Davis is set to launch a CBD-infused beverage this spring designed for high-performance athletes. The Defy beverage will be the first in a collection of CBD products.,14-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/news/ingredients/nfl-hall-of-famer-enters-the-cannabis-space-for-athletic-recovery/9140174-1-eng-GB/NFL-hall-of-famer-enters-the-cannabis-space-for-athletic-recovery_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/14/NFL-hall-of-famer-enters-the-cannabis-space-for-athletic-recovery,"Davis started getting migraines as a child and suffered through them throughout his professional football career. He relied heavily on strong painkillers for much of his life, knowing the toll they took on his body. But as the conversation around the health benefits of legalized cannabis grew, he started taking CBD tinctures as a dietary supplement in lieu of medication. Since making the switch more than a year ago, he claims he hasn’t experienced a migraine or other chronic pain.

This personal experience got him interested in the burgeoning cannabis space, particularly with how it relates to high-performance athletes like himself. Davis has stated that he believes if he had started using CBD earlier it could have prolonged his football career.

Davis won two Super Bowl titles with the Broncos and was a three-time Pro Bowler and three-time First Team All-Pro in his seven NFL seasons. He struggled with knee injuries at the end of his career but was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017.

Davis formed a partnership with friend Beau Wehrle to bring Defy to life and position a CBD beverage as a natural alternative to anti-inflammatory pills. Wehrle acts as CEO and co-founder of the company, and Megan Bushell rounds out the team as COO.

The Defy drinks will launch with the flavors Lemonade, Mixed Berry and Orange Mango with 20mg of CBD extract per 16oz bottle. Defy will start off with a performance line, but hopes to evolve the brand into more categories and products, like tinctures and a lifestyle drink.

The company has faced challenges in bringing the brand to market, and Wehrle told BeverageDaily that Defy uses a delivery system that’s been in the pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals industry for several years.

“One of the main obstacles in creating a beverage with CBD is that CBD is not water soluble. Any time someone tells you they have a water-soluble CBD solution, that’s not accurate. It needs to be in some sort of delivery system that can be suspended within the drink without breaking down and sticking to the sides,”​ he said.

Though the drinks can be enjoyed by everyone, Defy emphasized that they are skewed toward high-performance athletes. It’s recommended to consume them pre-workout, during workouts and post-workout, and the effects are usually felt after about 30 minutes.

“It’s for everybody. The professional athlete, the weekend warrior, somebody who is just trying to have a healthier edge on their life. Somebody who wants to have their daily defiance at work. It applies to everybody,”​ Wehrle said.

According to the Defy team, the CBD it is using is much more bioavailable than other forms of CBD on the market. The company is currently working with partners to conduct clinical trials with collegiate athletes and collect more data on the beverage’s effectiveness later on in 2019.

“The CBD space is extremely in need of proper regulation and players who are willing to voluntarily take on and put in place the proper protocols to ensure consumer safety of the product. We’ve invested in a lot of science and research to find the right CBD suppliers and delivery system, to develop the gold standard in the industry that the consumer can trust,”​ Bushell told BeverageDaily.

Defy is in the process of finalizing its website, where it will be sold in all FDA-compliant states. The brand will get into some brick-and-mortar locations with the launch, with immediate availability in Colorado where the company is headquartered.",NFL hall-of-famer enters the cannabis space for athletic recovery
"Ingredients supplier Tate & Lyle has partnered with NGO Earthwatch to assess the sustainability of its stevia supply chain, from seedling producers to industrial farms.",14-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator.com/news/business/sustainable-stevia-tate-lyle-to-assess-eco-impact-of-sweetener/9148844-1-eng-GB/Sustainable-stevia-Tate-Lyle-to-assess-eco-impact-of-sweetener_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/14/Sustainable-stevia-Tate-Lyle-to-assess-eco-impact-of-sweetener,"Tate & Lyle, in collaboration with stevia supply partner Sweet Green Fields, has teamed with non-government organisation (NGO) Earthwatch to examine the sustainability of its stevia supply chain.

According to the agreement, Earthwatch will assess growing practices and the socio-economic impact of the partners’ stevia supply chain in China, where the companies cultivate the plant.

“Earthwatch is looking at the environmental impacts of stevia and will quantify key aspects of the production system, including impacts on soil, water, waste, and energy use,” ​Earthwatch’s interim director of corporate partnerships, Maria Pontes, told FoodNavigator.

“The research seeks to identify best practices and develop evidence-based solutions that can help mitigate or eliminate some of the issues identified.”​

Stevia, a small shrub-like herb native to South America, grows leaves containing sweet compounds steviol glycosides. According to Sweet Green Fields, dried stevia leaves have been used to sweeten beverages, such as mate and tea, as well as foods for centuries. Stevia extract, which is considered to be 200-300 times the sweetness of sucrose, is attractive to the food and beverage industries for its natural, calorie-free, and zero glycemic load sweetening properties.

Tate & Lyle commissioned the research together with its stevia, and equity, partner, Sweet Green Fields.

The UK-headquartered ingredients supplier announced it had entered into an agreement​​ to take a 15% equity holding in Sweet Green Fields in May last year, in a move to accelerate portfolio development.

According to Tate & Lyle, Sweet Green Fields is the largest privately held stevia supplier globally. “Their industry-leading portfolio of stevia-based ingredients is highly complementary to our portfolio of proprietary sugar reduction solutions…” ​said Tate & Lyle’s chief executive Nick Hampton at the time.

The global stevia market was valued at US$447m (€397m) in 2016 and is expected to reach $1045m by 2023, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.8%, according to Market Watch.

In the food and beverage industry, the adoption of stevia as a sweetener by soft drinks brands such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo has helped grow market share, as has rising consumer awareness towards low caloric foods, according to the analysts.

Government initiatives designed to reduce the amount of sugar in processed food and drinks – in an effort to lower obesity and diabetes rates – has also increased stevia consumption.

In the UK, for example, Public Health England (PHE), the body that advises the British government on public health policy for all of the UK, has challenged the food industry to cut sugar in 10 food categories by 20% by 2020. Earlier this month, PHE published supplementary guidance for the sweetened drinking yoghurt​​ category.

Elsewhere in Europe, Germany has similarly called for food manufacturers to voluntarily reduce sugar​​, fats and salts in processed foods. The strategy includes a request that food manufacturers reduce sugar content in breakfast cereals by 20% and in soft drinks by 15-20% by 2025.

Indeed, sugar reduction has been targeted by governments across Europe via sugar taxes, including in the UK, Portugal and France.",Sustainable stevia: Tate & Lyle to assess eco impact of sweetener
"The cider industry is seeing record growth in the US, outpacing stagnant sales across general alcohol. It’s drawn in a gender-equal audience primarily made up of millennial consumers.",15-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/cidercon-infographic/9150273-1-eng-GB/CiderCon-infographic_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/15/Cider-succeeds-with-men-women-and-millennials-but-faces-retention-challenge,"There’s fresh competition for market share in alcoholic beverages beyond traditional beer, wine and spirits. Cider, along with flavored malt beverages (FMB) like hard seltzer, is experiencing massive growth in the US.

At CiderCon 2019 in Chicago this month, Danny Brager from Nielsen spoke to attendees about growth trends in the alcohol industry and what can be expected for US cideries in the future.

In 2018, off-premise beer sales dropped 0.2%, wine grew 2.1% and spirits grew 3.6%. It represents the consistently flat alcohol consumption rates seen in the US since 2000. But there is room for additional categories, as cider was up 8.4% in 2018 and FMBs grew 10.2%.

Cider represents less than 1% of the total alcoholic beverage market share. But Nielsen estimates that if cider’s share of beer in the US increases by just one point, sales would increase by 65%, or more than $800m.

The category did reach more than $500m in retail sales last year, already making its impact 10 times bigger today than it was 10 years ago. There are now more than 900 cideries open in the US.

Michelle McGrath, executive director of the US Association of Cider Makers (USACM), said “In 2017, USACM declared that it was the year of regional cideries. 2018 was really the year of expansion; cideries across the country increased their production, hired new staff, launched in new states, bought new equipment, and nearly 100 cideries opened their doors for the first time.”​

The innovation within cider has taken off, giving consumers more options than ever before. Education is a major mission​ of the industry, getting bars, venues and the public to understand that cider is more than a one-trick, apple-laden pony.

Different types of apples produce different types of ciders, and certain countries have their own cider styles. There is also a whole slew of fermenting techniques and countless fruit, spice and botanical varieties on the market.

Chile Guava from Stem Ciders, Basil Mint from Seattle Cider and a coffee-infused option from Blakes Hard Cider represent a small portion of the out-of-the-box flavors that came from regional cideries in 2018. Cidermakers are working to impress upon customers that there is more to cider than apples and pears.

Cider reaches an even audience and is the most gender-balanced alcohol category. It is 51% male drinkers and 49% female, while wine is 47% male and 53% female, beer is 61% male and 39% female, and spirits are 53% male and 47% female.

“That’s very much a strength that we need to leverage and should leverage, because our consumer base is gender diverse. What retailer or restaurant doesn’t want to appeal to a demographic base of both males and females?”​ Brager said.

In cider’s gender-equal base is a core audience of youth--40% are in their 20s. The lower ABV content attracts them because young people are tending to drink less alcohol and choose healthier options across all categories. Most dry ciders are very low in sugar and carbs, with a healthier label than traditional beers.

Cider also draws comparison to wine as an agricultural product, but considers itself a less intimidating and more approachable industry. But it's facing the challenge of retaining consumers, and making sure it’s a category that’s friendly to all drinking ages.

“Obviously we can hope that younger drinkers will be retained as they become older drinkers. But I don’t like to rely on hope as a strategy. It’s not a great one. So what are we doing as an industry to encourage older generations to give us a shot?”​ Brager said.

Nationally recognized brands like Angry Orchard, Woodchuck and Crispin are responsible for much of the category’s mainstream interest and growth, particularly in spreading the massive rose flavor trend in 2018.

But regional and local cideries are still the backbone of the industry. The category’s retail sales were up by 23% in 2018, and it now accounts for a third of all cider retail sales. In comparison, local craft beer increased by 9.3% in 2018.

A major opportunity for the industry lies in food pairing. In the same way that craft beer has leaned on the trend in recent years, cider can also do so today. Twice as many Americans now go out to eat and consume alcohol every week (70%) compared to those interested in just drink-led visits (30%).

In 2018, total on-premise cider sales in restaurants and bars was $722m, with a lot of room for growth. On-premise cider is about 4.5 times bigger than FMBs, and cider drinkers visit on-premise establishments more often than beer drinkers.

However, all drinkers are concerned with the experience they get from going out to a bar. Sales are expected to continue being driven by experiential drinking​ at brewpubs, taprooms and other venues for all categories.

Alcohol in general is fighting for consumers’ money and attention thanks to the expansion of the non-alcoholic category. Non-alcoholic beverages are $7bn higher today than they were four years ago.

Big players in that expansion are flavored waters like La Croix, a half-billion dollar brand. Kombucha is worth another half-billion dollars, grabbing customers with hard and alcohol-free varieties.

An increasing number of non-alcoholic brands are tapping into consumers' desires to drink less alcohol: positioning themselves as alternatives to alcohol.

According to Brager, a lot has changed in the non-alcoholic beverage grocery aisles in terms of colors, flavors and functional benefits that are available. He advises the alcohol industry to view it as competition, but also consider it for inspiration as to what can be adapted into alcoholic beverages in the future.","Cider succeeds with men, women and millennials; but faces challenge in retaining consumers"

"Kirin — which has its roots in the beer business — has launched an eight-year plan to better align its food, nutrition and pharma sections, with a major focus on health and wellness.",18-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-asia.com/article/2019/02/18/all-rounder-ambitions-kirin-announces-plan-to-bridge-businesses-between-beer-functional-food-and-pharma/9156146-1-eng-GB/All-rounder-ambitions-Kirin-announces-plan-to-bridge-businesses-between-beer-functional-food-and-pharma_wrbm_large.png,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/18/All-rounder-ambitions-Kirin-announces-plan-to-bridge-businesses-between-beer-functional-food-and-pharma,"The firm aims to be a global CSV (Creating Shared Value) leader providing value-adding services across multiple portfolios, from serving general needs to special needs, preventative healthcare, and medical treatment by 2027.

“The Kirin Group will expand the business of high-functioning ingredients and establish a unique business model by leveraging the Kirin Group’s extensive experience and assets in pharmaceuticals and food & beverages so as to provide solutions to health issues that have not been addressed. ​

“The Kirin Group will launch several new businesses that offer products and services tailored to meet the specific need of individual consumers and will eventually grow them into another core of the Group,”​ according to a company’s statement.

Profit growth will come from existing businesses as it seeks further opportunities.

Earnings wise, it is targeting a ROIC (Earnings before interest and after tax) of 10% increase by FY 2021 and a CAGR of 5% growth for its normalised EPS.

As of Dec 2018, Kirin recorded a revenue of JPY$1.93tr (US$17bn), a 3.6% growth from the previous year.

Normalised operating profit was JPY$199.3bn (US$1.7bn), 2.4% higher than 2017, however, profit attributable to owners of the company nosedived 32.1% YoY.

For this year, it is aiming to hit a revenue of JPY$2tr (US$18bn), which is a 3.6% growth.

Consolidated normalised operating profit, however, is expected to decline due to upfront investments aimed at strengthening the foundations for growth from a medium-to-long-term perspective, in addition to soaring logistics costs, according to the firm’s latest financial presentation.

As part of the business plan, Kirin will push for profit growth from its traditional brewery and beverage business.

Its brewery businesses currently include Kirin Brewery, Lion, Kirin Beverage and Myanmar Brewery.

For Kirin Brewery, one of the plans to pump profit growth is to broaden its ready-to-drink (RTD) alcoholic beverage offerings.

“The company intends to broaden its RTD offerings to meet changes in the alcoholic beverage market expected in the wake of an increase in the consumption tax rate and resulting from increasingly diverse consumer preference for alcoholic beverages,”​ the company said.

Hon-Kirin, a RTD beer released last March topped the sales chart, hit a sales volume of 128,000kl, four times higher than the second most popular product, the Nodogoshi Special Time.

Another plan is to support Japanese hop farmers and offering Tap Marché, a system that provides several types of beer using a single small dispenser, to food services outlets.

As for non-alcoholic beverage, it will focus marketing efforts on core brands, such as Gogo-no-Kocha (black tea), Nama-cha (green tea), and FIRE (coffee), while beefing up its offerings of sugar-free beverages that provide health benefits.

Outside of Japan, it aims to grow brand equity of its beer products in the growing categories in the Australian beer market while establishing its premium crafted beverage business in craft coffee and kombucha.

Elsewhere in Myanmar, it will increase the presence of its leading brands – Myanmar Beer and Andaman Gold by scaling up production and logistics networks.

Besides beer and beverage businesses, Kirin hopes to achieve “outstanding growth” ​and global expansion from its pharmaceutical arm, Kyowa Hokko Kirin.

To do so, it will optimise global operations by revamping its organisational structure, and develop new products for the global market.","All-rounder ambitions: Kirin announces plan to bridge businesses between beer, functional food, and pharma"

The initial volume of paper straws will be limited during the launch phase, as SIG ramps up capacity with its manufacturing partner.

SIG is also continuing to invest in ways to apply this alternative straw to a variety of packaging formats.

Markus Boehm, chief market officer, SIG, said the launch of a paper straw is in response to growing concerns about the environmental impact of plastic straws.

“We saw an opportunity to address concerns about marine litter and offer an added value product to our customers by helping them meet consumer and regulatory demand to scrap plastic straws​,” he said.

SIG said it worked closely with a manufacturing partner to develop the straw, which had to be robust enough to pierce the closed straw hole of its aseptic cartons.

The wrapper for the straw has also been redesigned to prevent litter by remaining attached to the pack to be recycled along with the rest of the carton.

The paper straws will be made of paperboard from FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified forests or other controlled sources.

Customers can already include the FSC​label on any SIG carton and they will be able to add the label to the paper straws once the manufacturing partner has completed FSC Chain-of-Custody certification, which is expected during the second half of 2019.

“We are committed to improving the environmental performance of our packaging and addressing the critical issue of single-use plastics is an important part of that,​” added Michael Schwan, manufacturing manager RTD, Dairy Strategic Business Unit, Nestlé.

"The Alkaline Water Company – makers of pink Himalayan rock salt brand Alkaline88 – is gearing up to launch a new hemp infused drink this year, using new technology",19-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/news/markets/alkaline-water-co.-furthers-hemp-drink-plans/9052804-5-eng-GB/Alkaline-Water-Co.-furthers-hemp-drink-plans_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/19/Alkaline-Water-Co.-furthers-hemp-drink-plans,"The Alkaline Water Company produces Alkaline88, a US alkaline water brand with a pH of 8.8. It's infused with minerals and electrolytes from pink Himalayan rock salt and is now using its original base as a springboard for further launches. The brand says new technology will improve bioavailability of hemp.

With the growth in popularity of alkaline water, brands are looking for ways to stand out in a crowded market.

A88 manufactures Alkaline88 and secured a trademark in 2013, allowing it to be the only US brand with ‘alkaline’ in its name. The drink contains just purified water and pink Himalayan rock salt, and the original formula is the base for other product development.

First up was a line of fruit-infused flavors in both sparkling and flat options. After working on development for 18 months, A88 announced the infusion line in September. It includes five flavors, like Blood Orange and Raspberry. The infusions formula starts off with a base from the core line, blended with a bit of fruit extract.

Alkaline Water Co. is now developing a new line of hemp drinks from its house brand A88 Infused Beverage Division, Inc. (A88).

Richard Wright, president and CEO of Alkaline Water Co., told BeverageDaily that for all future launches, “It will be an alkaline water when it is flat, it will not be when it is sparkling. It’s impossible to make bubbly water alkaline.” ​This applies to the existing fruit infusions and forthcoming hemp drinks.

Launching this spring from A88 is a collection of natural hemp-extract waters, containing non-intoxicating strains of CBD. The new hemp drinks are a result of an agreement A88 made with Infusion Biosciences, Inc. (IBS) to utilize its proprietary Aqueous Phytorecovery Process (APP) technology.

This launch is expected to make A88 “the first national US beverage company to bring true water-soluble, full-spectrum features of bioactive natural hemp extract molecules to US consumers.”​

“Our bioavailability will be better than everyone else’s, and that has to do with the fact that we use a different part of the plant. Everyone else is starting with straight oil, we’re using a lipid,”​ Wright said.

“It’s a little more expensive to extract, and it’s a little different procedure. There’s a whole bunch of patents and trade secrets around it.”​

Packaged in cans and bottles, Wright plans to have five or six different flavors of the hemp product. More flavor details will be released later, but he plans to draw from what customers are enjoying in the other line.

Alkaline Water Company is working with Infusion Biosciences Inc (IBS) to use IBS's acqueous phytorecovery process (APP) technology for its RTD natural hemp-extract formulations.

The onset of the hemp is about 5-8 minutes, compared to about 20-40 minutes found in other product. Due to FDA restrictions on the sale of hemp products, the drink will have limited reach when it launches in March.

ArchPoint Group will design the cans and bottles for the upcoming hemp line, seeking to create ‘a look and feel that captures the healthful lifestyle and clean beverage promise’ of the brand.

A big financial step for the Alkaline Water Co. in the new year was its listing on the NASDAQ stock market. It was announced in December that its shares of common stock were approved to trade on NASDAQ, and it rang the opening bell on January 23.

“From a capital market standpoint it’s a big step in the right direction,”​ Wright said. “It will do great things for the shareholder base and our overall growth. We’ll have capital when we need it to continue the growth story.”​

A88 also announced a partnership with Water Source One (WSO) to expand its production and distribution capabilities as the Alkaline88 lines grow. WSO will provide customer service and regulatory support, quality assurance management, and raw materials and logistical support.

Wright said A88 chose WSO because its network of more than 30 bottled water plants in the US and production expertise make it ""the ideal partner to expand our infrastructure to support our extensive growth plans.”​",Alkaline Water Co. furthers hemp drink plans
The PourMyBeer system allows customers to serve themselves with interactive touch screens and RFID cards that charge per ounce. The new wave in automation has been designed to tackle the bottleneck in crowded bars and overworked bartenders; but the company also sees wider potential.,18-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/pour-my-beer-3/9153928-1-eng-GB/pour-my-beer-3_reference.png,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/18/Self-serve-beer-expands-eliminating-bar-struggles-and-keg-waste,"Founder and CEO Josh Goodman became interested in the automated beverage industry after experiencing one too many crowded bars and struggling to order drinks. He started work on the idea in 2009 and launched the current system in 2015.

PourMyBeer currently serves 184 spaces across the US, and another 45 internationally. They are mostly found in new and existing bars and restaurants, and the company has partnered with several Whole Foods and Buffalo Wild Wings locations.

According to Goodman, the idea was born out of a frustration with the six to seven steps to getting a drink in a traditional bar setting: getting a server’s attention, ringing up the sale, delivering the beverage, etc. PourMyBeer says it can eliminate many of these steps and give more power to the consumer.

Taps are arranged along a wall, rather than behind a bar counter, positioned under touch screens and card readers. Goodman told BeverageDaily that his clients average about 30 taps each and two taps per screen.

Customers are given a plastic RFID card that slots into a reader at each screen. They are then charged for the exact amount poured at the taps--sampling just a few sips or a whole pint.

Goodman said most kegs lose about 20%-23% in revenue in a traditional bar setting, and that PourMyBeer estimates that it saves venues up to $142 per keg.

“That’s a considerable chunk of revenue that’s not being recognized. Since our system is basically a one step process, and every ounce that’s dispensed is charged to the end customer, there’s 100% yield or close to it,”​ he said.

Since launching in 2015 the system has evolved, learning that integrating with point of sales systems is critical for larger clients like Whole Foods. It tends to stay away from pop-up engagements, but has started working with the military to provide it mobile units for events.

Goodman also shared that Pour My Beer will partner with a large music festival sometime this year, with plans to dispense $1m worth of drinks per day to attendees through the system, using 50%-60% less staff than would be typically needed.

The system is flexible and can work with all types of alcohol. Pre-mixed cocktails are a popular choice, as well as ciders. Goodman said, “We always say we’re liquid agnostic, we don’t care what you dispense.”​

PourMyBeer doesn’t expect to reach full market penetration or completely replace bars, but it anticipates a future for the system among consumers drawn to experiential drinking​. The opportunity to try several drinks without purchasing full sizes or flights is an attractive one, and consumers are increasingly looking for interactive ways to drink and ‘go out’.

Beyond bar and restaurant venues, PourMyBeer sees potential within coworking office spaces that are growing in popularity in large cities. Hotels are another target market for the system, given that the RFID cards can be easily linked to hotel room keys.

Goodman also wants to become more of a data analytics company that can share with clients the age, gender, zip code, and pouring habits of customers. He believes it will be helpful information for owners and the beverage industry at large.","Self-serve beer expands, aiming to eliminate bar struggles and keg waste"
"The UK government has launched a consultation to help shape its proposed plastic packaging tax, highlighting its aim to drive higher use of recycled content in packaging.",19-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/getty-monticello/9162179-1-eng-GB/getty-monticello_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/19/UK-sets-out-plastic-packaging-tax-plans-seeking-to-boost-use-of-recycled-content,"The UK plans to introduce ‘world-leading’ tax on plastic packaging​ in April 2022, applying to all single-use plastic packaging that doesn’t include at least 30% recycled content. It has now opened plans up to consultation to determine issues such as what items the tax would be applied to, and the threshold of recycled content.

Meanwhile, plans for a Deposit Return Scheme for cans and bottles have also been opened up to consultation.

What would a plastic packaging tax look like?​

Over two million tonnes of plastic packaging is used in the UK each year: and the vast majority of plastic packaging in the UK is currently made from new, rather than recycled, plastic.

The government believes, however, that with the right incentives there is scope to increase the use of recycled content.

The key aim of the plastic packaging tax, therefore, is to encourage producers to use more recycled plastic in packaging. This would result in less plastic waste going to landfill or being incinerated, and would also reduce energy use (‘using new plastic typically has greater environmental impact: it requires unnecessary resource extraction and processing, with higher energy use and emissions than using recycled material’.)

“The government wants to encourage all liable manufacturers who could use more recycled material to do so, in order to reduce use of new materials and so maximise the environmental benefit,” ​says the government.

“This means making use of recycled plastic from all sources, including emerging technologies, whilst minimising the risks of unintended consequences for business and the environment.” ​

The government acknowledges that a plastic packaging tax needs to be both ambitious and realistic, proposing that a tax would apply to packaging with less than 30% recycled plastic.

“The government wants to set the threshold of this world-leading tax at an ambitious level, to reflect the pressing need to act on this issue,” ​it observes.

“The threshold must also be achievable in the foreseeable future for many types of plastic packaging, or large parts of the market will be discouraged from investing in solutions to meet the target.”​

A key issue in using recycled plastic is the cost: and the government hopes that a tax could help address this.

“Our call for evidence on single-use plastic waste last year highlighted that recycled plastic is often more expensive than new plastic, despite its lower environmental impacts. ​

""The Government wants to shift the economic incentives involved in the production of more sustainable plastic packaging, encouraging greater use of recycled plastic and helping to reduce plastic waste.”​

The tax will complement reformed Packaging Producer Responsibility regulations, which are being discussed in a parallel consultation. These reforms are intended to encourage businesses to design and use plastic packaging that is easier to recycle, and discourage them from creating packaging which is difficult to recycle.

The definition of ‘plastic’ would be drawn from Article 3 of the draft Directive on Single-Use Plastics: ""'plastic' means a material consisting of a polymer within the meaning of Article 3(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, to which additives or other substances may have been added, and which can function as a main structural component of final products, with the exception of natural polymers that have not been chemically modified.""​

The government’s definition of plastic would include bio-based plastic and plastics that are compostable, biodegradable or oxo-degradable, as well as fossil-based plastic.

“Although the government recognises there is an important role for bio-based, compostable and biodegradable plastic in certain applications, the objective of this tax is to shift demand towards the use of recycled material, and therefore the government’s initial proposal is that the tax will not distinguish between different types of plastic or different ways of design for disposal,"" ​it says. ""However, we would welcome views on this.”​

Plastic bottles, trays, pots and lids are all likely to be included in the tax, as are component parts such as labels and caps. While different components may be supplied separately by different manufacturers, they would all be taxed at the point of production. “Manufacturers at this point in the supply chain are closer to the point at which recycled content is added, and have a clear line of accountability to the amount of recycled content in a product”.​

The government has also announced plans to introduce a Deposit Return Scheme to tackle plastic waste. “​This could drive up the recycling of an estimated three billion plastic bottles which are currently incinerated, sent to landfill or left to pollute our streets, countryside and marine environment.”​

The government points to the success of similar schemes in countries such as Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden, where total return rates vary between 85% and 98%. Alongside plastic bottles, the proposed DRS also covers cans and glass bottles.

The government is seeking views on two options for how the DRS could work, putting forward two proposals.

The first option, known as the ‘all-in’ model, would target a wide range of drinks beverages placed on the market, irrespective of size.

The second option, known as the ‘on-the-go’ model, would restrict the drinks containers affected to those less than 750ml in size and sold in single format containers. This would target drinks sold for consumption outside of the home.

The British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) is backing the full deposit return scheme. Gavin Partington, Director-General, said: ""BSDA supports the introduction of a GB-wide full DRS for all plastic and can beverage containers as our assessment suggests this is the best way to increase recycling levels and tackle litter.""​

The Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA), however, says that it does not believe glass should be included, instead arguing that kerbside collection is a better solution.

Miles Beale, Chief Executive of the WSTA, said the industry has already done lots to reduce its impact on the environment, with initiatives such as using less glass in bottles and shipping in bulk.

“We remain unconvinced that glass drinks containers should be included within the scope of the proposed DRS scheme,” ​he said. “Glass must be treated differently to plastic - glass cannot be compacted safely and efficiently, unlike plastic, and broken glass is much more likely to cause injury. ​

“The reality is that following years of investment in recycling, councils across the UK already have well-established, trusted and efficient doorstep recycling schemes. Changes to this system, which could instead see consumers themselves burdened with returning glass bottles to point of purchase, are unnecessary. Changes would also pose storage issues for retailers, especially SMEs. ​

“Including glass in any DRS system would serve only to undermine existing recycling schemes, and would be highly likely to undermine achievements to date.”​","UK sets out plastic packaging tax plans, seeking to boost use of recycled content"
"A marriage between India Pale Ales (IPAs) and lager beer, India Pale Lagers (IPLs) have been a small sub-category of craft beer for the past 10-15 years. Often described as ‘strong, hoppy’ lagers, recent IPL launches are fighting for shelf space in the beer aisle.",19-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/ipl-fist/9160166-1-eng-GB/IPL-Fist_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/19/India-Pale-Lagers-carve-out-a-niche-in-craft-beer,"Lagers make up the majority of the US beer category and traditionally are brewed with a slow, cold fermentation. They are said to have a more ‘clean’ taste and ‘easy drinkability’ compared to their darker, stronger IPA cousins.

IPAs dominate the craft beer industry and use a short, warm fermentation process. They are heavier on the hops, with bolder fruit and spice flavors. IPLs incorporate both styles--they are fermented like a lager but then made with excess hops like an IPA.

The IPL concept has developed a steady fanbase over the last decade, though it’s still a niche beer style with low recognition. Independent craft brewers have been slowly delving into their own IPL recipes, and many still are exploring the IPA-lager hybrid without commiting to the IPL label.

In January, Stone Brewing of San Diego launched the Stone Tropic of Thunder Lager, describing it as “a lager for IPA lovers”​ without actually calling it an IPL. It will be a permanent addition to the Stone Brewing portfolio and available in all 50 states.

Dominic Engels, Stone Brewing CEO, said ""More than 75% of US beer sales are lagers – predominantly from Big Beer. So given our history in challenging convention, and our successes in the category of IPAs, we're releasing what I'm affectionately referring to as a 'lager for IPA lovers.' It's finely crafted, intensely flavorful and undoubtedly independent, because lagers deserve flavor too.""​

Stone Brewing was looking to add “something super flavorful and yet really crushable” to its lineup, and it contains aromas of citrus, pineapple and coconut, followed by flavors of lime, orange and passion fruit. It uses Cashmere hops, a newer variety that is said to “impart flavors of ripe cantaloupe that elevate the juicy qualities of this beer.”​

Small craft player Iron Fist Brewing is helmed by brewmaster Tom Garcia, previously with Stone Brewing. He launched Fresh Perspective IPL this month, a beer with “classic pilsner overtones and a floral bouquet,”​ and “notes of herbal spice, earth, lemon and a touch of honey on the finish.”​

Iron Fist is redirecting its strategy after nine years in business, using the launch to focus on ‘short-run tap room exclusives.’ They are released monthly on draft and in a limited batch of 500 cans. Garcia pivoted to small batch beers to have room for brewing experimentation.

“We’re really excited to have introduced a new structure to our brewing that allows us to continuously push the boat out and try new things on a monthly basis,”​ Garcia said.

Other IPLs that hit the market in the last few years include Triboulet from Arches Brewing, a ‘hop-forward lager’ made with flaked high-protein grains; an option from Colorado-based Bristol Brewing; and one from WeldWerks Brewing Co.

"Domestic and international sales of Argentinian yerba maté hit a “historic record” in 2018, according to the National Institute of Yerba Maté (INYM).",19-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/fresh-and-powdered-yerba-mate-leaf-emersoncruz/9162995-1-eng-GB/Fresh-and-powdered-yerba-mate-leaf-EmersonCruz_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/19/Argentina-celebrates-historic-record-for-yerba-mate-sales,"Known as mate​ in Spanish-speaking countries and chimarrão​ in Brazil, the herbal infusion made with yerba maté leaves (Ilex paraguariensis)​ is a ubiquitous drink in Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil.

According to the Argentinian trade association, the National Institute of Yerba Maté (INYM), last year was a record year. Domestic sales for yerba maté last year in Argentina reached 261.9 million kilos while exports came to a total of 43m kilos.

This represented an increase of two million kilos domestically despite “a complex economic context​” while foreign exports grew by nearly 39% compared to 2017.

Carlos Coppoli, head of marketing at the INYM, puts this down to a combination of many factors.

“On the one side, INYM developed several advertising actions in different key markets, and the results are becoming visible,""​ he told FoodNavigator-LATAM. ""Companies also became more aggressive in their marketing actions and sales efforts. ​

""Then, the Syrian market, the biggest export market for our yerba maté, is recovering and growing after a couple of years of retraction due to socio-political troubles in the country.​

“All this contributed to increasing our exports to more than 40 million kilos in 2018. On the other side, the domestic market is also strong and growing, and this is really good news for the yerba maté sector, one of the few that gave positive numbers this year.”​

2018 was also a good year for yerba mate producers. They harvested around 809m kilos, after suffering lower yields in 2017 due to climate factors.

Within Latin America, the biggest export market for Argentinian yerba maté is neighboring Chile.

“​In the south, they already had an old tradition of maté consumption, but not in Santiago, its capital city,""​ said Coppoli. ""​We are working hard to increase maté popularity and consumption in the central and northern regions of Chile.​

This work has been paying off, according to Coppoli.

""Exports have been growing from 2.7 up to 4.3 million kilos, and we hope this is only the beginning. Chilean people love maté because of its healthy properties, natural origin and its mystic [image].”​

However, the biggest export market for the herbal infusion globally is, somewhat surprisingly, Syria.

In 2017, Argentina exported 22,563 tons to Syria and 800 tons to Lebanon.

“History can explain that,” ​Coppoli told us, speaking from Gulfood in Dubai where the INYM was exhibiting this week.

“Lot of years ago [between 1850 and 1860], Syrian people came to Argentina and fell in love with maté. Then, back to its country, they took the magic of the infusion with them and its popularity grew so much that they have their own bands.​

Drinking yerba mate is so deeply engrained in Syrian culture that many believe the custom originates there.

“Yerba maté is also imported from Argentina in bulk containers and packed in Syria with Syrian names. Most of the yerba maté consumed in Syria is in the traditional mate way and imported from Argentina​,” he added.

Yerba maté manufacturers are also courting health-conscious consumers in export markets such as the US and Europe.

“In Argentina, yerba maté is drunk mostly in the traditional way, but in the past years, there has been a lot of work done in [product] innovation,"" ​said

Meanwhile, Coca-Cola Brazil launched a range of yerba maté Nespresso-compatible pods under its Leão brand​​ last year to meet Brazilian consumers’ demand for “practical and convenient​” drinks.

“We think that these developments will open new horizons for the product […] not only for the food and drink industry [such as] maté herbal teas and other drinks, desserts, soups, shakes and more but also in cosmetics and medicine.”​

Maté innovation is also set to go digital. Unicode Consortium has developed a maté emoji for users​​, which is expected to be available on instant messaging provider Whatsapp this year. Yerba Mate Argentina, the brand of INYM, said it showed “​the infusion is a cultural phenomenon spread throughout the world”.​",Argentina celebrates 'historic record' for yerba maté sales
"An entrepreneur and an artist walk into a bar in Australia, start chatting to the owner and come out with a premium mixer brand.",20-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/gin-and-tonic-getty-marianvejcik/9167171-2-eng-GB/gin-and-tonic-getty-marianvejcik_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/20/Beverage-entrepreneurs-Australian-artisan-tonic-with-artistic-flair,"That’s the long and short of The Artisan Drinks Co’s backstory, after British healthy juices entrepreneur Steve Cooper entered Sydney’s The Barbershop with compatriot graphic designer Alan Walsh. There they got chatting to Walsh’s friend, Mikey Enright, a leading bartender and proprietor of Australia’s gin bar of the year.

“They came in the bar, got chatting about the mixer market, where it was currently at. The kind of guy Steve is, he just asked why we don’t make our own mixer, and it started from there​,” recalled Enright.

“It began as a pub chat, then we started making some samples. Alan worked on the design to give it a really fresh look and feel to make it stand out​.”

A year ago Artisan launched in Britain, where it now has four lines: a classic London tonic water with complex natural citrus flavours with subtle botanical notes, a low-calorie version, a vibrant tonic with violet, elderflower and apple blossom and a barrel-smoked cola for bourbon, whisky and rum. Now the brand has also recently begun distributing to the land where it was conceived.

A gin specialist, Enright stocks 700-odd gins in The Barbershop, a grooming parlour-cum-gin bar in Sydney. He also speaks widely about gin at industry events and has worked with artisanal brands to devise new products.

“I’m quite engrossed in this area more than any others​,” said the Englishman-turned-Aussie of Australia’s booming gin scene.

“We did a blind tasting recently for the Australian Distillers Association with about 180 local gins. I understand there’s more out there as well, so it’s pretty huge. The biggest category here, in terms of craft distilleries popping up, is whisky. But with gin growing now, it’s really good for the industry​.”

Australia and the UK: two different markets

The rise of an artisanal segment often comes with the rise of associated accoutrements, like tonic in the case of gin.

In Australia, though, demand for premium tonics is far behind that of the UK, Enright believes. He says consumers in the Old Country are well used to splashing out on complementing artisanal mixers in bars and cafés, as well as stocking them in the fridge at home.

By contrast, Australians are better used to the cola gun, even in more upmarket settings, for their mixers. Price-conscious establishments are more attuned to keeping the cost of drinks down than offering premium sidekicks to their top-shelf spirits.

But a change has slowly been taking place with tonics, with brands like New Zealand’s East Imperial and Quina Fina, which is available in over 70 markets, leading the market and showing good growth.

But as more premium and artisanal gins become available, consumers are starting to change how they think about mixers as they turn to seek quality over quantity, Enright believes.

“They don’t have much choice in most bars yet, so a bit of work needs to be done in that area. When you look at the taxes on a bottle of Australian gin—a bottle can cost A$90 [US$64]—if they’re going to invest so much money in a product, they’re going to put two and two together and realise that they’re better off finding some good-quality tonic water too.​

""It just adds more dimension to your drink. And to introduce a non-gin drinker into the category and offering them flavoured tonic waters—almost as a cocktail—everyone can get involved​,” Enright added.

Artisan’s four lines of mixers are made mainly from British ingredients, but the company is looking at a number of different botanicals from around the world for new tonics, including from Australia, which has an abundance of in-demand native ingredients.

Until then, the current range has been designed to standardise classic styles of mixers, especially tonics. And later this year, Enright and his partners plan to launch a “fiery” ginger ale containing African ginger and chilli, a tonic fused with rose water and elderflower, one with extracts of wild cinchona bark and a soda water to ""provide a pallet-pleasing, stylish mixer​”.

Asked how the brand is able to spruce up soda water, Enright says marketing will be the key, especially as it is an impressive seller in an increasingly health-conscious Australian market.

“I suppose it’s probably down to people who want to take soda and want nice packaging to at least make it more interesting than its taste​.

“Soda water is very big in Australia—actually, more so than low-calorie tonic. Vodka soda has been a sort of national drink here for quite a long time. There’s concern about sugar and whatever else. So I think it will be exciting to get that out in the market. It is what it is, I suppose, and it looks good​.”

With artist Alan Walsh on board the management team, funky design​​ is central to Artisan’s strategy to position the brand in a mixer market dominated by traditional-style packaging. The intention is for “people to feel like they are buying a small piece of art, and hopefully that will persuade them this is a bit fresh and different​”.

With a year and now two markets under their belt, the partners are now eyeing new markets, with Singapore and Italy the front-runners, though the focus will remain on the UK and Australia for the time being.

“We just want to grow our market and see what we can make of it, just see what we can do​,” said Enright. “I’m really excited about bringing out different flavours if we go with mixers for other spirit categories, but we’re just rolling with it. We have some good plans and some good partners behind it, so we’ll see where it goes​.”",Artisan tonics brand finds the best plans are hatched in the pub

"Ingredion's new stevia sweetener, the BESTEVIA® Reb M Stevia Leaf Sweetener, has received approval from Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) to be used as an 'intense sweetener'.",13-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-asia.com/article/2019/01/31/reshaping-sweetness-ingredion-s-stevia-and-saraya-s-monk-fruit-latest-additions-to-australia-and-nz-s-sugar-reduction-arsenal/9086410-1-eng-GB/Reshaping-sweetness-Ingredion-s-stevia-and-Saraya-s-monk-fruit-latest-additions-to-Australia-and-NZ-s-sugar-reduction-arsenal_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/13/Reshaping-sweetness-Ingredion-s-stevia-and-Saraya-s-monk-fruit-latest-additions-to-Australia-and-NZ-s-sugar-reduction-arsenal,"Launched jointly with Ingredion’s partnering company Sweegen, the new stevia sweetener is made from stevia leaf extract Rebaudioside M (Reb M).

According to Ingredion, the Reb M is extracted from the stevia leaf via a ‘bioconversion process’​ that can ‘achieve high quantities […] economically unattainable from traditional stevia extraction methods’​.

“BESTEVIA® ​Reb M stevia leaf sweetener is 200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar,”​ said Ingredion via its website.

“The process starts with the leaf of the stevia plant and results in a 95% pure Reb M stevia sweetener with significantly less bitterness and aftertaste than conventional stevia sweeteners, […] enabling levels of sugar reduction that were impossible or unpalatable until now.”​

Because of its sweetening properties, the new sweetener can be used ‘more ​competitively’ by food and beverage manufacturers to reduce the actual sugar content in products, heeding the ongoing sugar reduction trend.

“The sugar-reduction trend is reshaping the way manufacturers formulate for sweet taste globally,” ​added Ingredion Asia-Pacific Innovation Director Eric Weisser via the official press release.

“The world-wide trend towards clean labels [also] supports the use of nature-based, non-GMO, sustainable ingredients [like in this sweetener],”​ added Sweegen.

FSANZ amended the current specification for Rebaudioside M under the Australia and New Zealand food standard code to include this new sweetener ‘[a]fter performing a detailed safety evaluation’​, according to Sweegen.

As per the FSANZ website, Reb M is classified as a steviol glycoside intense sweetener, which is in turn considered a food additive.

“We conduct a thorough safety assessment of all food additives, including sweeteners, before they are approved for use in food,”​ said FSANZ.

“[In this safety assessment], we check whether they are safe at the levels being proposed, and that there is a good technological purpose for their use.”​

Reb M aside, monk fruit​ is also gaining traction down under.

Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) aproved an application made by Saraya Co., Ltd. to permit the use of monk fruit extract as a food additive to perform the technological purpose of an intense sweetener.

FSANZ approved the draft variations on October 31, 2018 and The Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation was notified of the decision on 12 November 2018.

“FSANZ has conducted a thorough safety assessment and concluded there are no public health or safety issues related to the use of monk fruit extract as a sweetener,”​ said FSANZ Chief Executive Officer Mark Booth back in September 2018.

According to the final approval report, “Monk fruit extract has a number of advantages over other already approved intense sweeteners.”​

“It has a relative lack of bitter taste and can be used as a sugar substitute in baking (as it has high temperature stability and no unpleasant aftertaste).”​

Previously, monk fruit was only permitted for sale in Australia and New Zealand as a fruit or drink flavouring.

Additionally, FSANZ has called for submissions over a new production method for rebaudioside D (Reb D), a steviol glycodside sweetener that is already permitted under the Food Standards Code.

“FSANZ's risk assessment found no health and safety concerns with the new method,""​ said FSANZ CEO Mark Booth via an official statement.

“The applicant is seeking approval to include a new specification for Reb D produced by an enzymatic conversion method.""​

Submissions will be accepted until March 26 2019.

Other sugar reduction efforts in the region​

Australia is taking the sugar reduction battle very seriously, with food and beverage companies leading the charge.

Last year, the Australian beverage industry announced a pledge committing to a 20% reduction in sugar across the board by 2025​, helmed by big names including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Asahi.

“It’s a landmark commitment, and a sign of the beverage industry’s awareness that we have a crucial role to play,”​ said trade organisation AusBev’s CEO Geoff Parker.

“The industry has also made critical moves to reduce sugar intake in the country, by offering greater choices for Australians with less/no sugar as well as different pack and container sizes.”​

According to the NZ Herald​, the New Zealand Beverage Council is considering a similar initiative.

In pursuit of its 2020 10% sugar-reduction target, Coca-Cola New Zealand in turn launched its new ‘Less Sugar Fruit Drink’ Keri in 2017 with 50% less calories and sugar from fruit juice than regular Keri beverages.

It also innovated and launched lower/no-sugar options like Coca-Cola No Sugar and Coca-Cola Stevia No Sugar in the country.

For other food companies, efforts are abound as well, especially in R&D. A good example is the ‘groundbreaking material science [that] makes less sugar taste just as good’ ​as posted by Nestle Australia.

“This truly groundbreaking research is inspired by nature and has the potential to reduce total sugar by up to 40% in our confectionery,”​ said Nestlé Chief Technology Officer Stefan Catsicas.

“Our scientists have discovered a completely new way to use a traditional, natural ingredient.”​

The technology was implemented in Nestle brand Milkybar Wowsomes ​in the United Kingdom last May, and Nestle General Manager Confectionery Martin Brown said that the company aimed to bring the chocolate bar to Australia and New Zealand soon as well.

The company also halved the size of its Allen’s Killer Python lollies in 2014 to 24g (336kJ) as compared to the previous 47g (630kJ) in an effort to ‘bring confectionery serves down to scale’​.",'Reshaping' sweetness: Ingredion's stevia and Saraya's monk fruit latest additions to Australia and NZ's sugar reduction arsenal

"The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), Consumer Federation of America (CFA), and National Consumers League (NCL) say that alcohol labeling reforms proposed by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TBB) 'fall dramatically short of what is needed to truly modernize alcohol labeling'.",26-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/news/regulation-safety/consumer-groups-criticize-ttb-modern-alcohol-labels/9187160-1-eng-GB/Consumer-groups-criticize-TTB-modern-alcohol-labels_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/26/Consumer-groups-criticize-TTB-modern-alcohol-labels,"The CSPI, CFA and NCL say that the proposals fail to require brands to put alcohol content, serving size, calories, ingredients and allergen information on labels.

The TTB recently set out plans to reorganize and recodify labeling and advertising regulations for wine, distilled spirits and malt beverages. The proposal is set out in “Modernization of the Labeling and Advertising Regulations for Wine, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages” (Notice No. 176)"".​

In a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, the CSPI, CFA and NCL expressed hope that “this rulemaking will bring greater clarity and consistency to alcoholic-beverage regulation,” ​but also said that this proposal “falls dramatically short of what is needed to truly ‘modernize’ alcohol labeling.”​

The organizations argue that consumers want to see alcohol content, serving size, calories, ingredients and allergen information on the labels of alcoholic beverages. But most current packaging does not reflect this.

“Not only do consumers want this information; the TTB needs it to fulfill its statutory obligation under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA) of 1935, which directs the TTB to ensure that alcohol labeling and advertising ‘provide the consumer with adequate information as to the identity and quality of the products’,”​ the groups said.

In 2003 the CSPI provided the TTB with survey data that suggested 89% of adults supported labelling of calorie content. The NCL, CSPI and 67 other organizations petitioned the TTB to require a Serving Facts Label akin to that used on packaged food and beverages.

In 2006 the TTB issued proposed rules to require mandatory allergen labeling, followed by Serving Facts information in 2007. But neither rules have been finalized and most label information is voluntary.

“Consumers expect—and need—to know what they are drinking in order to make informed choices,”​ the groups said, emphasizing its importance by pointing out that “as of May 2018, calorie and key nutrition information also must be provided at chain restaurants, including for alcohol when it appears on the menu.”​

The groups wrote, “While the proposed rule offers some benefits in terms of minor adjustments to labeling rules, it explicitly excludes action in the areas of most concern to consumers, ‘due to their complexity’.”​

“While the TTB may believe that the issues are complex, the agency has now had over a decade to consider them, and rulemakings to provide this key information are already well underway. These rules should be prioritized under any effort to modernize alcohol labeling.”​

The TTB has declined to comment to BeverageDaily on the letter, considering it is “still in active rulemaking on Notice No. 176.”​

The TTB currently has an open comment period for this rulemaking, running through March 26. It’s encouraging “all interested parties and stakeholders to submit comments for the public record”​ at the official Notice portal.​",Consumer groups criticize TTB modern alcohol labels

Edinburgh Beer Factory will use the technology to code ‘Best before’ dates and batch codes on its automatic bottling line, which processes around 2,000 330ml bottles per hour.

The company is pleased with the quality of the codes, which are highly legible and always appear in the same position on the bottles.

Martin Borland, head brewer, Edinburgh Beer Factory, said its original coder for batch and date codes wasn’t quite right so it started looking for alternatives.

“The price quoted was what we paid and in the first few months we’ve had no problems at all as well as regular support from Linx's sales team​,” he said.

“We’re confident about the future because we know the machine can go faster if we need it to, and from running successful trials, we know it works well on larger bottle sizes​.”

CSL30 uses no ink which means there is no drying time on the bottles or risk of smudging. It comes with a LinxVision Touch Screen and adjustments can be carried out in minutes.

The manufacturer said it chose the can format for the new range due to its durability, recyclability and premium appeal. A matte finish on the cans creates “tactile experience​” for consumers, it added.

The French dairy giant has been looking to expand its portfolio beyond dairy in recent years.

"PepsiCo boasts 22 billion-dollar brands, with its portfolio including flagship drinks Pepsi, Gatorade and Tropicana. But what’s next? Having taken over the reins as CEO from Indra Nooyi in October, Ramon Laguarta sets out his strategic vision of what the company will look like in 2025.",22-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/article/2019/02/22/what-will-pepsico-look-like-in-2025/9163294-6-eng-GB/What-will-PepsiCo-look-like-in-2025.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/22/What-will-PepsiCo-look-like-in-2025,"Laguarta says that PepsiCo’s vision for the company includes being a ‘much faster growing company’, building on opportunities to grow share in its key categories.

And while the company will invest in areas such as brand building and supply chain capacity, it is also building capabilities in other areas such as e-commerce – ‘large channels that are driving a lot of growth for the categories’.

Barcelona native Laguarta has already spent 22 years with the PepsiCo in a number of executive and leadership roles, and prior to joining the company he worked for confectionery company Chupa Chups in Spain.

‘Immense opportunities for us to innovate’​

PepsiCo announced its FY2018 results this month, with full year organic revenue growth of 3.7%. Asked what his 2025 vision for the company is, Laguarta says he believes PepsiCo can grow and become a company that touches two billion people around the world every day.

“You should think of PepsiCo as a company that plays in two huge large categories that globally, have a lot of tailwind,”​ he said, speaking to analysts in the FY2018 earnings call.

“I think you should be thinking about a company that has a long-term value creation model, centered around accelerated growth and sustained growth, and gaining share consistently in our two large categories.​

“How we do it? I think we painted a picture on how we're thinking about our portfolio and how we're going to be look very holistically at the opportunities in each of our categories. And there's multiple demands, spaces, there's a lot of coffers, there's a lot of different dayparts in those categories that provide for immense opportunities for us to innovate and build brands and continue to grow.​

“Geographically, you should be thinking about a company that is, I would say, skewed to developed markets, Western Europe and the US. And obviously, long-term, we would like to be stronger in some of our developing markets, where we have strong positions to build on top, so we have strong talent, we have strong market position in some of those markets. ​

“And you should think about us growing very fast in those geographies. We sell one and a half billion servings a day, so we touch conceptually one and a half billion people around the world every day, so our ambition is to touch at least two billion people every day. ​

""So you should be thinking around the vectors of how many people we serve every day and around what do we offer those people in terms of the both the convenient foods and the beverage categories.”​

In FY2018, PepsiCo’s North America Beverage (NAB) division saw operating profit decrease 16%. PepsiCo says this “reflects certain operating cost increases, including increased transportation costs, a 7-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings and net revenue growth.”​

The division is PepsiCo’s largest sector by revenue, and PepsiCo has been prioritising boosting its NAB unit with increased investment and marketing and innovation, and Laguarta says he is well aware of the challenges faced by the division.

“NAB has many leading brands in growing beverage categories and operates a differentiated integrated business model. We believe our operating model is a competitive advantage that provides superior customer and system alignment, speed to market and system-wide efficiency,”​ said Laguarta.

“With that said, in a dynamic market, NAB has faced a number of challenges over the past 18 months. New entrants have come to market in some of our stronghold categories. There are opportunities to improve some of our brand marketing and consumer engagement. And there are areas where we can step up our local marketplace execution.”​

But Laguarta says the company has ‘good plans’ in place to make the most of its opportunities. ​

“We've increased both the quality and level of A&M on key core brands, including Pepsi and Mountain Dew. ​

""We've increased our innovation to address new category entrants and to drive success in higher growth segments, with innovations like LIFEWTR, bubly, Gatorade Zero, new variants of Propel and extensions within our successful Starbucks and Pure Leaf Tea guidance.​

“At the same time, we're having good success with Pepsi Zero Sugar, and this has been a key element in stabilizing the performance of our trademark Pepsi business.” ​

Laguarta says the company is making changes to its NAB organization structure and adding frontline resources to make the company more agile and respondent to local commercial opportunities and local competitive actions.

“While there is more work to do, we're very encouraged by this steady sequential improvement we've seen in the business. We are confident that with more well-placed investments, we'll see continued improvement,” ​Laguarta concluded.",What will PepsiCo look like in 2025?

Protein is increasingly in demand in the medical nutrition market. According to Innova Market Insights, the number of global medical nutrition beverage product launches featuring whey protein grew by 9.9% CAGR between 2012 and 2017.

However, high-protein whey beverages can gel over time, taste can be compromised and, if the ingredient is not heat-stable, processing equipment can be blocked.

The shot contains added minerals and Lacprodan DI-7325, a high-quality whey ingredient suitable for beverages containing minerals which maintains good viscosity and heat stability.

Lise Povlsen, senior category manager at Arla Foods Ingredients,said: “There is increasing demand for low-volume medical nutritional food and beverages with high levels of high-quality protein. The excellent nutritional profile of whey protein makes it the perfect ingredient for this. ​

""But the fact is whey proteins can be challenging in beverages when concentration increases. Thanks to Lacprodan DI-7325, your next low-volume, high-protein medical beverage solution will have great heat stability, it won’t gel over time, and it won’t compromise on taste.”​

The illuminated labels belong to Inuru's patented technology activating the Coca-Cola logo to light up on touch.

“We are certainly interested in future developments that could drive the cost of this kind of printed electronics down and eventually permit the use of this technology in at least seasonal or promotional mainstream packaging activities,​” said Georgi Blaskov, senior brand manager, Coca-Cola CEE.

Marcin Ratajczak, CEO, Inuru, said the LEDs functionality comes within a thin piece of paper embedded with its OLED light on a digital printer. They are self-powered and there is no need to charge them with a plug or wires.

For the Coca-Cola #BeSanta campaign the labels were produced in two steps; first with label converting specialist, All4Labels, which used conventional inks and printing technology to produce pressure-sensitive paper labels bearing all the typography and colours typically found on a Coke label.

Then the rolls of these labels, including the release liner, were sent to Inuru, where the paper labels printed by the company were laminated on top.

“We print both the light source and the energy source. ​When the label is touched, it’s like a circuit is closed between energy source and light source, which causes the Coca-Cola label to light up​,” he added. ​

Ratajczak said this is the first time it has brought an OLED product in a packaging application to a sizeable audience by a major brand.

“The potential of our technology lies in the fact we can scale the production easily to billions of units because our inks make it possible to print OLED at a fraction of the cost of technologies used in the production of electronics​,"" he said.

"Approximately 8% of AB InBev’s global beer volumes now come from no and low alcohol beers, as the world’s largest brewer works towards its goal of 20% by 2025.

And the trick to succeeding in the category is to have a wide range of products within the low/no alcohol category to appeal to a wide group of consumers and occasions, says CEO Carlos Brito.

Consumer trends in health and wellness have spurred innovation in the no and low alcohol beer category.

The largest brewers have all recognised a need to tap into this demand: including AB InBev along with Heineken (which now offers a Heineken 0.0​ version of its flagship brand) and Carlsberg (which has seen 33% growth of alcohol free brews​ in Western Europe).

As part of its Smart Drinking Goals, AB InBev wants to see existing drinkers integrate no and low alcohol beers (3.5% ABV or below) into their current drinking choices.

AB In Bev’s no and low alcohol portfolio includes Budweiser Prohibition (launched in 2016), Hoegaarden 0,0 (2012), Jupiler 0,0%, Castle Free (launched in South Africa in 2017), Carlton Zero (launched in August in Australia), Aguila Cero (Colombia), and Leffe Blonde 0.0% (launched this year in Belgium).

No and low alcohol beer currently makes up 8% of AB InBev’s portfolio: and the beer giant plans for this to reach 20% by 2025.

This goal of 20% has already been reached in six of its markets: Australia, China, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama and Honduras.

“Our no- and low-alcohol beer (NABLAB) portfolio continues to cultivate new opportunities in many of our markets by addressing the growing consumer trends of moderation and health and wellness,” ​says AB InBev.

“With these trends becoming ever more important to consumers around the world, we are committed to leading innovation in this space.”​

AB InBev CEO Carlos Brito says the NABLAB category is no longer about having one or two alternatives to traditional beers: it’s about mirroring the choice found in the traditional beer category with a wide range of no and low beers.

""We decided to approach no and low alcohol beer as we do with the global brands: for example, in a portfolio approach way,""​ he said, speaking in the company's FY18 earnings call last week.

“We believe that for global brands, the way to really do it is through a portfolio approach, not with one brand, because consumers have more and more occasions, they're used to more and more assortment, more and more choices. So we built a portfolio of global brands that appeal to different needs, different occasions, and are complementary - and are doing very well.​

“And we're using the same strategy, portfolio approach, to no- and low-alcohol beer. We believe it's about different brands. ​I'm here in Belgium, and we have Hoegaarden zero-zero with different flavors. We have Leffe zero-zero and we have Jupiler zero-zero. ​

""And that's exactly what consumers want, because these brands are different, they offer different profiles in terms of liquid, styles, and consumers want to have that option. ​

This drive for a ‘robust portfolio’ has spurred on new product launches, said Brito.

“As such, we have launched 12 new products this year resulting in 76 brands globally that qualify as no- and low-alcohol. What makes the segment even more exciting is that these brands is often command a premium price point and the margins are typically higher, since excise taxes tend to be lower.”​",AB InBev: 8% of beer volumes now come from no and low alcohol

One major trend among new launches has been the influence of wine-inspired cider, beginning with the rise of rosé cider last year.

Now brands are exploring other ways to incorporate a wine vibe into their cider, like prosecco and pear drinks​ and Stella Artois’ new canned Spritzer. After testing well in late 2018, the Spritzer launched nationwide in February.

Stella calls it “a twist on the classic white wine spritzer,”​ which is traditionally a mix of white wine and carbonated water. The Stella Spritzer instead blends apples and hibiscus flavors for a dry cider with a low ABV (3.5%).

Lara Krug, VP at Stella Artois, told BeverageDaily “In the last few years we’ve seen a rise in sparkling wines and flavor trends amongst millennial consumers - for example, the recent rosé craze - but the innovations outside of wine haven’t caught up.​

“Spritzer is our take on what we think will be the next big ‘it’ drink with consumers - sparkling spritzers that are very drinkable and offer an alternative to wine.”​

Stella’s existing Cidre is more of a traditional, sweet cider that launched in the US in 2013. It was one of the earliest mainstream brands to add a cider to its beer-focused portfolio. It shares similarities with the new Spritzer, but has a more crisp, sparkling taste.

Spritzer will be sold in a six-pack of slim, 12oz cans, rather than the glass bottles the Cidre is packaged in. It’s rolling out nationwide this spring.

“The slim packaging means Spritzer can be taken on-the-go, and there’s no cork screw needed, so we hope to see consumers enjoying Spritzer during all manner of occasions and whenever they’re in need of a bubbly moment,”​ Krug said.",Spritzer is Stella’s first US innovation since 2013

Craft brewing: ‘Bringing focus back to what we love most’​

Jing-A Co-founders Alex Acker and Kris Li – ‘two North American guys and long-time Beijingers with a passion for great beer’ - say growing the brewery has been an ‘incredible journey’ to date.

But it has also required a shift in focus.

“There’s a saying in this business that if you want to be a brewer, don’t start a brewery – and that definitely has some truth to it,” ​they say.

“Over the past year, we’ve found ourselves increasingly pulled out of the brewery and into the back office. ​

“As a result we’ve been exploring funding options that would support Jing-A’s future development, while at the same time allow us to bring focus back to what we love most – brewing craft beer in China.”​

The duo say the investment from Carlsberg will allow them to take their beers ‘to the next level’. ​

“With this new partnership, we continue to retain full control of Jing-A while receiving support where we most want it – state of the art brewing/lab facilities and a solid distribution network.​

“We’ll be able to take the quality of our beers to the next level – including popular seasonal and small-batch beers from our brewpub – and make them more widely available to beer lovers in Beijing and throughout China.​

“It will be the same people doing it, driven by the same passion and creativity – now with more support for quality, innovation, and distribution.”​

"﻿Nestlé is launching a new variety of Nesquik in Europe. In a move indicative of its global commitments on single-use plastics, Nestlé is rolling Nesquik All Natural out in an innovative new paper packaging material that is plastic-free and fully recyclable.",04-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/nesquik-sep/9214268-1-eng-GB/nesquik-sep_large.png,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/04/Nestle-launches-Nesquik-All-Natural-in-plastic-free-packaging,"In a “global first”​ for Nestlé, its latest innovation, Nesquik All Natural, will be available in a specially developed paper-based packaging.

The launch comes just two months after the Swiss food group said it will accelerate action to tackle plastic packaging, pledging to make 100% of its packaging re-usable or recyclable by 2025 and placing a particular emphasis on plastic waste.

According to senior packaging specialist Sarah Divanbeigi, hitting this target is “a challenge”​ and Nestlé is examining a series of options.

“We are looking at developing alternative materials for our products, like the Loop system. We are looking at alternative recyclable materials such as paper. We are trying to develop biodegradable and compostable materials and packaging. We are trying to look into using more recycled content in packaging where possible. And we are trying to simplify the structure of our packaging.”​

Divanbeigi noted that Nesquik All Natural is the “first product that puts the [packaging pledge] to the test”​ moving away from plastic, which can be difficult to recycle, to paper, which is “fully recyclable”​.

The product development process is evidence of Nestlé’s efforts to be more agile in innovation. Nesquik All Natural took just nine months to complete, from conception to launch. This is a notable achievement given the particular challenges of developing a paper-based packaging material.

“The use of paper as a packaging material is not as easy as it seems… Packaging in this particular space is quite fragile, it doesn’t hold well in factory environment, it doesn’t travel well in the supply chain,”​ Divanbeigi explained.

“In order to address these challenges papers are usually laminated with a plastic layer. For the Nesquik All Natural range, instead of using a laminate we used a coated paper. It is a food contact approved grade and it protects the product but is still recyclable in the paper stream.”​

Details of the coating are “proprietary”​, Divanbeigi told FoodNavigator. However, she added, it is commonly used in the paper industry.

“We have been working in partnership with an external company. Where possible we are trying to use what is already existing in the industry instead of trying to reinvent something. Coating paper is commonly known but this is coming into content with food so we had to be careful in terms of the chemistry… it was quite a difficult balance.”​

The company also had to strike a “balance”​ between developing a material that was fully recyclable in the paper stream and protecting the product. The company has carried out “extensive​” tests to ensure the paper pouch performed adequately in storage and transportation.

While single-use plastic is now recognised as an important problem for the food sector, plastic-based packaging does effectively help extend a product’s shelf life.

Divanbeigi said calculating the impact that the new packaging solution has on shelf life is complicated by changes in product formulation. “It is not a simple calculation that if you change your packaging your shelf life will reduce – it depends on the formulation as well.”​

However, Peter Mester, business executive officer for confectionery and dairy, confirmed that the nine-month shelf life of the new All Natural product is below the year and a half shelf life of other SKUs in the Nesquik range.

Nestlé does not believe this will be a problem. According to Divanbeigi, the 168 gram packs contain 25 servings and should be used in the home well-within six months, even by “very low users​”. Mester added that retailers typically carry 30-60 days of stock in store. “We don’t think it will cause an issue with shelf life.”​

While the end price of the product is ultimately decided by the retailer, Nesquik All Natural’s list price will be 40-50% more expensive per kilo, Mester revealed. This will partially be offset by offering a smaller pack size.

The price premium reflects higher input costs, in particular related to the recipe formulation.

“The cocoa content is almost twice as much as the mainstream recipe. The sugar is the cheapest ingredient inside a recipe. The sugar in this recipe is differentiated – it is raw cane sugar that we are going to import from outside the EU. These factors will increase the price,”​ Mester explained.

Divanbeigi believes that the packaging will not add a significant layer of cost. “This is a new material and in terms of costs, we are still working on that. It is not that much different from what we are currently using,”​ she suggested.

However, because the paper packaging is more fragile than plastic, the production line currently has to run at 40% of the speed.

Nevertheless, Divanbeigi is upbeat on the potential of this paper-based solution. “This is the first time we have used this. We are looking to see how we can apply this learnings to as many products as possible as time goes by.”​

Nestlé is launching the new Nesquik All Natural in five European markets in the coming weeks: France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain. It will sit alongside the existing Nesquik range, and will be rolled out to other European countries in the “near future”.​

Plans are also well underway for further products in the Nesquik All Natural range across Europe, to be launched within the year. These include a zero sugar version.",‘The first product to put our plastic pledge to the test’: Nestlé launches Nesquik All Natural in paper packaging

The Asia-Pacific region is currently home to about 60% of the world’s population of older people, defined as those aged 60 years or older.

And the number of older persons in the region is expected to more than double from 600 million in 2018 to nearly 1.3 billion by 2050.

This means the demand for nutrition and food products suitable for the elderly population will soar, while younger people are increasingly aware that the nutrition and health choices they make today will affect their quality of life in older age.

This event will look at how the nutrition and food industry can meet the needs of the rapidly ageing populations of today, and more crucially, tomorrow.

Editor-in-Chief of both titles, at Regional Head of APAC for publisher William Reed, Gary Scattergood said: “Last year’s event was hugely successful in shining the spotlight on the efforts food and nutrition companies are making to promote healthy changes across all life stages. ​

“The overwhelming consensus was that healthy ageing begins from conception, and that food and nutrition can play a pivotal role in ensuring we ultimately lead healthier, as well as longer lives.​

“With the number of older people in the region predicted to hit 1.3bn by 2050, the event also highlighted the immense opportunities for industry to meet the demands of the region’s soaring senior sector.”​

Among the first wave of confirmed speakers, are:

This year’s event will highlight the latest new product development from firm’s striving to make heathier alternatives, including through reformulation and fortification.

It will also assess emerging research and its product potential across nutraceuticals, spanning heart health, cognition, join, bone and muscle health, among others.

It will also look at how industry and policymakers can better align to meet the region’s population challenges, and drill down into the latest market trends and data.

Last year’s event was attended by over 170 delegates from across the globe, with 90% revealing in a feedback survey that it met or exceeded their expectations. 85% said it attended significant value to their business.

"A no deal Brexit would create added red tape for the wine industry: generating more than 600,000 additional forms and costing the wine industry £70m ($93m), according to the UK's wine association. Ultimately this could lead to increased prices for consumers.",27-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/news/markets/wine-inspectors-will-find-themselves-drowning-in-paperwork!-wine-association-fears-no-deal-brexit/9196192-3-eng-GB/Wine-inspectors-will-find-themselves-drowning-in-paperwork!-Wine-association-fears-no-deal-Brexit_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/27/Wine-inspectors-will-find-themselves-drowning-in-paperwork!-Wine-association-fears-no-deal-Brexit,"A no deal Brexit would mean UK wine businesses have to ‘jump through hoops to import wine into the UK’ thanks to the introduction of new forms and laboratory test demands, says the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA).

Miles Beale, Chief Executive, WSTA, said: “The reality is that if we leave the EU without a deal wine businesses, big and small, will be facing a catalogue of extra costs which will ultimately be passed onto the British consumer.”​

The UK is set to leave the EU on March 29. If a deal is reached, this will put mechanisms in place for a transition period. Without a deal, however, the UK will ‘crash out’ of the EU.

Pressure is mounting on the government to set out a clear path forward. Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal was rejected by MPs last month; and MPs are due to vote on a revised deal on March 12.

The WSTA has been campaigning for the government to find a deal, and its ‘Don’t bottle it’ campaign has already highlighted the threats from a no-deal scenario - such as the uncertainty created for business, issues over cash flow, staff shortages and delays of products at the border.

It has now written to members of parliament Michael Gove, Liam Fox and Philip Hammond to highlight mounting costs facing the UK wine industry, particularly with regards to the potential of extra red tape from a no deal Brexit.

The WSTA says that the combination of additional forms, wine duty hikes, wine tariffs and rising inflation will likely mean a rise in price for consumers.

Around 55% of the wine drunk in the UK is imported from Europe. The industry is largely made up of small winemakers and independent merchants, which feel the pressure of extra paperwork more acutely.

Wine entering the EU must be accompanied by a VI-1 form. If Britain leaves the EU without a deal, an estimated 500,000 new VI-1 forms - all accompanied by a lab test - will be required for wine that enters the UK from Europe.

Wine from the UK which is destined for the EU will also have to use a VI-1 form, adding around 150,000 forms.

It costs in the region of £20 for each two-page document, which has to be filled out by hand.

In addition, wine inspectors will feel the pressure of the extra paperwork, argues the WSTA.

“Every handwritten VI-1 form will have to be scrutinised and stamped before wine from Europe is allowed into the UK. ​

“It is estimated that it would take 12 full time wine inspectors a whole year to process the half a million new VI-1 forms expected to mount up after a no deal Brexit. This does not take into account the other work carried out by Wine Standards who currently consist of a team of six regional inspectors.”​

A no deal Brexit would mean that the UK would lose the EU’s Excise Movement Control System (EMCS), which tracks alcohol coming in out of the country with electronic documentation. This would ‘likely to see ports descend into chaos’, says the WSTA.

Whitehall officials are holding emergency meetings to discuss the rise in paperwork - which is predicted to ‘treble their workload overnight’, according to the WSTA.",‘Wine inspectors will find themselves drowning in paperwork!’ Wine association's no deal Brexit fears
"The wine industry is shaping up to be more transparent and international than ever in 2019. Consumers want more local, sustainably sourced wines, but at the same time they are expanding their palates to newcomers on the market from places like Bulgaria, Hungary and Georgia.",27-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/news/markets/millennials-buy-more-wine-online-and-want-it-to-be-organic/9192398-1-eng-GB/Millennials-buy-more-wine-online-and-want-it-to-be-organic_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/27/Millennials-buy-more-wine-online-and-want-it-to-be-organic,"Across food and beverage, consumers are demanding transparent supply chains. They want to know what goes into products before they purchase and consume them, and have made a push for more organic and sustainable choices.

It’s a movement led by millennials, who are more likely to adopt ‘healthy’ trends like biodynamic farming and diets like keto and paleo. Young people are also finding more ways to buy their groceries online, shopping for globally-inspired flavors and a roster of healthy food in general

This has bled into the wine category in a major way, according to Alan Beasey, Sommelier and Head Bartender at The Purple Pig in Chicago. He told BeverageDaily that restaurant patrons now ask for organic wines ‘all the time.’

“People that come into the restaurant are very interested in making conscious choices about what they’re eating and what they’re drinking. They get excited about knowing where things come from and how things are produced,”​ he said.

“They lean toward and focus on local produce for food choices. A big category for wine is natural, organic, sustainable production methods.”​

Organic wine only accounts for about 3.6% of global wine consumption, but it’s a fast-growing movement​. Beasey said it’s important that more winemakers are turning toward organic and biodynamic practices to preserve the vineyards and soils, and also believes that it improves the quality of the wine.

He thinks this shift is born partly from the effects of global warming and climate change, as a lot of old winemakers with centuries of tradition are looking at these changes in weather patterns and climate as an opportunity, more than as a limitation.

France's Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, widely considered to be one of the world’s best wine producers, famously converted to biodynamic farming in all of its vineyards, inspiring other winemakers to take on the complicated and expensive process for getting the most out of their land.

Consumers are responding to this by asking for more label transparency​ in their alcohol and for options that reflect sustainable and biodynamic practices.

“It pushes the industry to make changes; it pushes us to be more conscious about the wine we’re sourcing and that I’m buying. I look for these things now, and it’s important to me,”​ Beasey said.

An interest in foreign market wines is expected to flourish in 2019, and Beasey reports that even the landlocked midwest is seeing an influx of options beyond classics like France, Italy and Napa Valley.

Germany and Austria are producing more red wines than usual, which require a longer growing season and warmer temperatures. Beasey thinks more “interesting and good quality wines”​ are coming out of central Europe, like from Georgia and Hungary.

Unfortified, dry wines are being explored by Portugal, which is well-known for Port and other sweet dessert wines. And Lebanon, Armenia, Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovenia are all ramping up their winemaking abilities as well.

“Some of these countries were under the former Soviet umbrella, and they have just now started to get their wine and beverage industries back on track after decades of being held under the thumb of the former Soviet government,”​ Beasey said.

“It took until now for some of these countries, like Armenia, Georgia and Bulgaria, to revive what was a centuries-old winemaking tradition that never really died, but it was in hibernation for a long time.”​

Beasey said that the Fertile Crescent area of Eastern Europe and Western Asia is home to “a great bedrock of winemaking”​ that is “being re-awoken.”​

To enjoy these ‘re-awoken’ wine markets, US millennials are turning to the internet. Wine.com sold 38,000 different wines in 2018 from 5,500 wineries, and millennials now make up one-third of the site's shoppers.

Rich Bergsund, CEO of Wine.com, said ""Mobile is the best thing to ever happen to wine retailing. It puts the power of wine scores, write-ups, videos and our live chat experts right in the hands of our customers -- helping them discover and enjoy wine with confidence, wherever they are.""​

Wine.com launched a mobile app in mid-2017 and mobile revenue has since grown to represent 30% of total revenue. Mike Osborn, founder and executive VP of Wine.com, credits the success to young consumers’ disdain for in-person shopping: ""Millennials will not put up with the dreaded 'wall of wine' at retail,""​ he said.

With consistent annual growth of 15%-20% over the last few years, Wine.com’s success represents the public’s desire to make it easier to purchase alcohol online. Wine has seen a more complicated path to ecommerce than most other food and beverage products.

Wine.com will start sharing its online wine purchase data with Nielsen to make the channel more transparent, and to “measure, predict and activate on insights to improve performance within the wine category.""​

Beasey of The Purple Pig finds all the latest shifts in wine consumers' behavior helpful to the restaurant and bar industry, even with the rising popularity of ecommerce.

He said, ""It helps make us better when our guests are better informed, and when consumers are more engaged and enthusiastic about trying new things. It motivates us and keeps us always trying to improve and come up with the next thing.""​",Millennials buy more wine online and want it to be organic
Personalisation in drinks has been talked about for years: yet we’re only now starting to see fully tailorable liquids and the era of truly personalised ‘drinks on demand’ and ‘drinks as a service’ is still emerging.,27-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/robot-cocktail-getty-apartment/9093700-1-eng-GB/robot-cocktail-getty-apartment_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/27/Personalization-in-drinks-Tailored-beverages-and-drinks-on-demand,"In 2013, Coca-Cola swapped its bottle’s logo with hundreds of first names (and later over a thousand) so people could ‘Share a Coke’ with friends. They made many more names available when buying direct online and supported the sharing of personalised virtual bottles too.

That was a very crude type of personalisation of course, but it’s limited how far you can push a low value, high volume product that’s successful because it’s always the same.

Bottles of spirits, carrying a much higher price point than Coca-Cola, can now be bought with customised labels. In 2014, The Famous Grouse played on their name to tailor bottles bought online with labels such as ‘The Famous Dad’ or ‘The Famous Chef’ accompanied with your own uploaded photo. The following year they made the service available in Selfridges with printing live in store.

It’s now commonplace to be able to personalise the label with your own greeting when buying spirits online (such as this example from Glenfiddich​).

All these examples are just changing the dressing. But now brands are starting to personalise beyond the packaging to the liquid itself.

In a rather unsophisticated fashion, Coca-Cola’s Freestyle vending machines​ let you mix drinks perfectly to your preferred taste.

More impressively, the robotic bartender Nino​ by Makr Shakr serves up custom cocktails in seconds.

Pernod Ricard’s Opn​ supports custom cocktail making at home with a connected cocktail library using an ecosystem of devices, applications and services.

Johnnie Walker’s My Edition​ enables people to purchase whiskies that are matched to an individual’s flavour preferences. Despite the feeling of a custom match, there are in fact only six varieties of the product but you get the impression of creating highly personalised blends.

There are a number of other services, however, that more widely open up the blending process to consumers. Whisky Blender​ enables drinkers and gifters to create a 70cl bottle made up of a completely customisable mix of up to seven different varieties of whisky. Master of Malt​ offers a similar service and also a Home Blending Kit​ to experiment with a custom blend before committing to a full bottle.

While these examples are personalising drinks, they’re rather bluntly mixing existing malts, blends and base ingredients. What about creating a completely custom brew of beer or distillation of a spirit?

Specific beer brews have been created for large conferences and events but rely on a certain volume of production and budget to be viable.

Making your own homebrew can be a complex, laborious and often disappointing pursuit. Yes it’s personalised, but it has little appeal to today’s ‘on demand’ generation used to getting things at the click of a button or tap of a screen.

LG thinks it has the answer with HomeBrew​, unveiled at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Its capsule-based craft beer making machine aims to simplify and digitise the process of brewing your own beer. However, waiting approximately two weeks for your brew means it’s unlikely to appeal to impatient Millennial and Generation Z drinkers.

Depending on what ingredients you use, a brand new gin can be created and distilled in a matter of days. Some producers like Oro Distilling​ provide a personalised distilling service, one step closer to truly personalised drinks on demand.

Whisky naturally has to age at least three years before it’s ready so such a service for Scotch lovers is unlikely to surface anytime soon.

Have it your way

We expect to see more personalised liquids in 2019, extending beyond the label and beyond blending to craft completely new drinks that you can call your own.

Nitro cold brew coffee brand Rise Brewing Co. has announced a partnership with USA Surfing and USA Climbing ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. In furthers Rise’s mission to ramp up national distribution and recognition.,28-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/news/markets/rise-brewing-co-partners-with-new-olympic-sports/9175811-1-eng-GB/Rise-Brewing-Co-partners-with-new-Olympic-sports_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/28/Rise-Brewing-Co-partners-with-new-Olympic-sports,"Surfing and Climbing will debut at the Olympics for the first time in 2020, and the US teams will head to Tokyo with Rise as their official coffee sponsor. The partnerships have already begun and will be represented at all major regional and national events leading up to next summer’s games.

On February 8, Rise kicked off the partnership with USA Surfing at Toyota USA Surfing’s Prime Series in Huntington Beach, Calif. On February 1, the USA Climbing deal debuted at the Bouldering Open National Championship in Redmond, Ore.

The coffee will be provided to the organizations, judges, athletes and attendees at all upcoming competitions throughout the seasons.

Zachary Brinchi, marketing and communications manager for USA Climbing, said “As an organization that is always on the move and constantly making coffee shop runs, having convenient, ready-to-drink coffee that also tastes great is a huge win. Our athletes are looking for quick alternatives to coffee for those early mornings at the crag or at the gym.”​

Greg Cruse, CEO of USA Surfing, said “Rise Brewing Co. is such a smart, progressive group of pros, who are making big waves in the market. Our athletes like the portable, clean energy the drink provides for early morning surf sessions and it tastes amazing.”​

Rise is focusing on expanding its reach and distribution in 2019, building on the success of the last 12 months. In 2018, Rise opened a flagship cafe in Manhattan, established a presence in the Pacific Northwest and launched its Organic Nitro Cold Brew Oat Milk Latte​.

The oat base is used for the Oat Milk Latte and Mocha Latte, both introduced in September along with the Classic Latte. The inspiration behind the latte line came from Rise’s customers.

The company found that more than half the people asking for milk in their coffee at Rise locations in New York wanted non-dairy, with oat leading the pack. The latte cans are now available alongside the core flavors: Original Black, Lemonade and Blood Orange.

In conjunction with the USA Surfing and USA Climbing partnerships, Rise is showing up in more mainstream retailers this year. It will enter 2,000 Walmart​ locations in April as part of its effort to move the brand west.

CEO and co-founder Grant Gyesky recently moved to Oregon to further the brand’s growth in the region, going straight to the ‘home of coffee’ for inspiration and expansion. Since debuting in 2014, Rise has built a strong presence on the East Coast, Florida and California.",Rise Brewing Co partners with new Olympic sports

In the US, the company delivered its best annual share trend performance since 2012.

“2018 was another step forward in our company’s transformational journey. We had many successes to celebrate, though the year was not without its challenges,” ​says the company.

“Today we are a stronger, more diversified company applying our learnings across our global business. While there is more work to be done, we are confident in our strategy and plans to grow our business by creating value from seed to sip and delivering sustainable top and bottom line growth in 2019 and beyond.”​

Premium to grow 5x faster than core and value​

Premiumization continues to be key to growing the beer category, says AB InBev.

“We see a significant opportunity for premiumization around the world and we have the best portfolio to lead this trend. Compared to wine and spirits, beer is in its early stages of premiumization globally, providing us with the opportunity to capture beer’s fair share.​

“For instance, Corona currently has a market share of 3% or higher in just three countries where we own the brand. With the brand growing double digits globally, we believe it is still far from reaching its full potential and see an opportunity for further growth.​

“We expect the premium segment to grow about five times faster than core and value in the years ​to come. Our High End Company is well positioned to capitalize on this trend and deliver high growth and profitability.”​

Revenue grew by 4.8% in FY18, boosted by 5.8% growth in the fourth quarter. Revenue per hl grew 4.5% in FY18, driven by premiumization and revenue management initiatives. Volumes grew by 0.3% in FY 2018, with own beer volumes up 0.8% and non-beer volumes down 3.6%. Combined revenues of AB InBev’s three global brands, Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, grew by 9.0% in FY18. Outside of their respective home markets, the global brands grew by 13.1%. EBITDA increased by 7.9% in FY18 as a result of top-line growth and enhanced by cost discipline and synergy capture. EBITDA margin expanded by 118 bps to 40.4%. AB InBev saw volume, revenue and market share growth in important markets such as Mexico, China, Western Europe, Colombia and Nigeria in FY18. “​Each of these markets delivered strong performances in their respective premium portfolios while simultaneously evolving their core portfolios in line with the category expansion framework.”​ Performances were ‘below expectations’, however, in Argentina, Brazil and South Africa, due to a weak macroeconomic environment.

In the US, revenues declines by 0.7% over the year but grew 1.3% in the latest quarter. Revenue per hl grew by 1.9% in FY18, driven by revenue management initiatives and continued premiumization of the portfolio.

Premiumization continues to be a key driver in the US: particularly with brands like Michelob Ultra and craft-style brands in its High End portfolio (the High End saw revenue grow 18.3% in 2018).

“Our above core portfolio continues to outperform the industry; driven by Michelob Ultra, our regional craft portfolio, the recently rebranded Bon & Viv Spiked Seltzer and our innovations in the segment,"" ​says AB InBev.

“Michelob Ultra accelerated its growth this quarter, solidifying its position as the top share gainer in the US for the past four years. Our 2018 innovation pipeline contributed 50% of total industry innovation volume, up from 10% in the previous year, and included Michelob Ultra Pure Gold, Bud Light Orange and the Budweiser Reserve series. These innovations had a strong year and continue to gain share, enhancing the premiumization of our portfolio.”​

“Within their segments, Budweiser and Bud Light are performing better than prior year trends. However, the core and core light segments remain under pressure as consumers trade up to higher price tiers.​

“Our Super Bowl advertising was in line with our strategy to strengthen the beer category. We drove stronger consumer awareness of our premium brands and innovations including Stella Artois, Bon & Viv Spiked Seltzer, Michelob Ultra and Michelob Ultra Pure Gold.”​

AB InBev’s UK business achieved double-digit top line growth in 2018, with strong performances from global brands, the craft portfolio and Bud Light.

Capitalizing on the demand for premium brands, Michelob Ultra was introduced to the UK​​ last year. “In the States, Michelob ULTRA has been the fastest-growing beer brand in terms of volume and value share for the past three years and we have big ambitions for it in the UK,”​ said Paula Lindenberg, president, AB InBev UK & Ireland.

The latest launch from the MillerCoors brand is part of a larger trend of wine-inspired ciders that are seeking to expand the category into new drinking occasions and appeal to an audience of wine drinkers. Other mainstream cider brands like Woodchuck and Wyder’s have already launched a pearsecco option.

Though cider is made from apples, brands often experiment with fruit flavors like berries, pineapple and pear. Nielsen data revealed that pear-flavored ciders were up 120% in 2018 and prosécco wines were up about 10%.

Crispin already has a pear cider in its portfolio called Pacific Pear, described with an aroma of “ripe pears with floral notes and hints of stone fruit”​ with ‘woody complexity’ and earthiness.

Pearsecco is lighter - “a marriage of pear-based cider with a bubbly prosécco taste, offering a unique, crisp, yet dry taste.”​ It will be packaged in a 12oz slim can design, available in six packs once the flavor is permanent.

Danielle Rappoport, director of Ciders at MillerCoors, said ""The release of Crispin rosé was our first venture into wine-inspired ciders at the forefront of the rosé trend last year.""​

""Both prosecco and pear-inspired beverages have seen strong growth in recent years. With the new Pearsecco flavor, we are continuing to appeal to cider and wine drinkers alike with yet another rendition of our fresh and modern take on cider.""​

Crispin wants the slim cans to be convenient for sampling and being poured into wine glasses, and designed the cans in pastel colors to be enjoyed throughout the spring and summer seasons. The Pearsecco packaging is light teal.

Pale blues are emerging as the color of choice for pearsecco ciders, similar to the way light pink dominates the packaging for all rosé drinks, including cider. Woodchuck introduced a pearsecco in 2018 with a light blue can, and Wyder’s pearsecco bottles also have blue labeling.

The pearsecco blues and rosé pinks invoke similar aesthetics that appeal to millennials. About 40% of cider drinkers​ are in their 20s, and the ‘millennial pink’ trend even mirrors the colors of rosé cider packaging.

Companies are branching out to attract the key millennial and forthcoming Gen Z audiences that prefer low ABV alcohol and healthy, clean labels over traditional beer, wine and spirits.

MillerCoors acquired Crispin in 2012 and operates a portfolio of alcohol brands outside of beer, like Smith & Forge Hard Cider and Henry's Hard Sodas.",The new rosé cider? Crispin introduces Pearsecco cider in time for spring
"From farms in Brazil to supermarket shelves in the Netherlands, blockchain technology has enabled Albert Heijn to enhance traceability and transparency across its orange juice supply chain.",01-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/rainforest-alliance-certified-seal-lg-300x266-jpeg/9204402-1-eng-GB/rainforest-alliance-certified-seal-lg-300x266-jpeg_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/01/Reaping-the-fruits-of-blockchain-How-Albert-Heijn-links-orange-grove-to-shopping-basket,"Blockchain is an open and secure digital ledger that enables a permanent record of transactions.

The technology has been leveraged by a great number of industries, from pharmaceuticals to finance – most famously used by cryptocurrency Bitcoin – to ensure security and promote consumer trust.

Now Dutch supermarket Albert Heijn (AH) is tapping the technology for its own brand of orange juice. By scanning a QR code on AH’s orange juice packaging, consumers can see the route the oranges have travelled, from farm to supermarket shelf.

An AH smartphone app also allows consumers to check the percentage of oranges that come from each of its supplier’s 25 Rainforest Alliance Certified plantations in Brazil, when they were harvested, and their degree of sweetness.

“We wanted to combine…safety, health and sustainability…for the customer,” ​said AH senior director of quality assurance and product sustainability, Anita Scholte Op Reimer, at the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) conference in Nice, France this week.

“We care about our consumers, and what they think of this product and the supply chains that…bring the product to our shelves.”​

Beginning with the farmer, AH’s orange juice supply chain also comprises the processor, cold storage unit, bottler, and retailer.

“The oranges are picked, then the concentrate made has to be shipped – it is an international supply chain. When it arrives at [bottling firm] Refresco in the Netherlands, it is again processed and then goes to our warehouses and into our stores,” ​explained Scholte Op Reimer.

“It is not such an easy supply chain. We thought blockchain would be a good solution because [the supply chain is] complicated.”​

In addition, the technology allows for both the manufacturers’ concerns and customers’ interests – which are not always the same – to align.

Primary risk areas in orange juice production, according to AH, include forced labour and excessive working hours, wages (when lower than the minimum and living wage), health and safety of workers, excessive use of agro-chemicals, and deforestation and loss of habitat.

The consumer, however, is predominantly interested in where the oranges come from, when they were picked and from which fields, how the juice is produced, and how sweet it tastes.

Blockchain offers the best of both worlds. “The journey of the orange is the journey that brings all these [elements] together,” ​said Scholte Op Reimer.

The project, which took just five months to implement, is the product of a collaboration between retailer AH, orange supplier Louis Dreyfus Company (LCD) Juice, bottling firm Refresco, and technology partner Supply Chain Information Management (SIM).

While the blockchain ledger incorporates data from each stakeholder, Scholte Op Reimer stressed that the data remains with each party. “We haven’t created a big new database. Before the whole process, we agreed what data is there – because not all data is digitally available – [and] that everyone would upload their data.”​

Trust in its partners was crucial to the project’s success. “Only people make technology work. Blockchain will never run without trust,” ​we were told.

Moreover, each party must stand to gain, she continued. “All have to benefit. It wouldn’t have worked if Refresco [for example] couldn’t [use the project to] show the industry that they are a trustworthy partner.”​

Rather than focus on the food safety and quality aspect of its orange juice product, AH has taken the opportunity to push the sustainable, transparent and healthy aspects of its supply chain to consumers.

“Our sustainable orange juice comes from Rainforest Alliance (RFA) Certified farms. This means that farmers must follow more sustainable farming methods that help to protect the environment, nature [and working conditions],” ​Scholte Op Reimer told delegates.

“We​ congratulate Albert Heijn on introducing this orange juice for which Rainforest Alliance certified oranges were grown. It is good that so many consumers are able to enjoy orange juice that contributes to improving the environment and the future of orange grove keepers and their families,” ​said Rainforest Alliance CEO Han de Groot in a statement last year. “An ever-increasing number of consumers want to have information about where their food is coming from and how it’s made, and it is, therefore, wonderful that Albert Heijn clients can follow the route of their orange juice. We encourage other parties to follow this example.”​ ​​

This story extends across the entire supply chain. “Customers can see when the product arrived at LDC Juice and when it was concentrated, also when it was shipped from Brazil to Ghent in Brazil…you can see all the dates of production… This is all visible for our customers within the app,” ​said Scholte Op Reimer. “I think we tell an amazing story by doing this.”​

In the age of social media and digital communication, AH has used blockchain to take the project full circle.

On the app, a ‘Like2Farmer’ function allows consumers to send messages directly to the 8,000 fruit pickers working across LDC Juice’s 25 groves. The messages are displayed on television screens in the buses that take the workers to the plantations.

“The messages I have sent have been ‘Thank you for this tasty orange juice’, or ‘I hope you have a lovely day’,” ​said Scholte Op Reimer.

“This is really connecting the customers to the farmers in Brazil. We are really closing the circle and bringing that connection back to the farmers.” ​

While the high number of consumers using the app when the project first launched – which counted in the thousands – has since reduced to “a stable base”​, the company continues to see value in the project.

“We [both] tell the story to the customer and [make] sure that the oranges were safely produced…[with] no fraud in the supply chain.”​

AH is also running a blockchain project for eggs, with plans to expand the systems to incorporate additional products. “We haven’t decided which ones yet, we want to do a proper analysis of where it will best make the best impact,” ​said Scholte Op Reimer.",Reaping the fruits of blockchain: How Albert Heijn links orange grove to shopping basket
Yili has partially switched from carton to PET bottles investing in three aseptic lines from Sidel including its Sidel Aseptic Combi Predis for dry preform sterilisation.,01-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/dairyreporter.com/article/2019/03/01/yili-ambrosial-greek-yogurt-in-pet-single-serve-bottles/9205361-1-eng-GB/Yili-Ambrosial-Greek-Yogurt-in-PET-single-serve-bottles_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/01/Yili-Ambrosial-Greek-Yogurt-in-PET-single-serve-bottles,"As part of the changes the Chinese dairy is packaging Ambrosial Greek Yogurt in PET single serve bottles and plans to diversify its portfolio with more value-added products.

The Sidel Aseptic Combi Predis machines are equipped with specific dosing valves with wider diameter and a low-high speed regulation to prepare for future market requirements.

Arnaud Poupet, product manager, sensitive products, Sidel, said the yogurt drinks are intended to attract active, health-conscious consumers with growing expendable incomes.

“This demographic is particularly relevant among young Chinese people who, typically, have fast and busy lifestyles but do not want to compromise their way of life in terms of convenience and design of the products they choose​,” he said.

“The lines we installed were the first high speed lines for liquid dairy products globally. Additionally, these lines are producing yogurt, which is a highly viscous product, with the same safe and flexible aseptic flow meter filling valve configuration applied for still beverages.​

“The bottles are produced from white PET preforms including TiO ​, which requires a high process expertise to ensure consistent good bottle quality at a high speed​.”

Prior to the launch Sidel carried out a number of laboratory tests to determine the behavior of different liquid dairy products (yogurt, UHT white milk) in several PET barrier materials (PET multi-layers and mono-layer with different rates of TiO ​).

The scientists evaluated different caps’ opacity to achieve the optimal light and oxygen barrier and ensure the product’s stability without any alteration in terms of taste or color, resulting in a 5-month yogurt shelf life.

China is seeing a growing demand of liquid dairy products for Ready-to-drink (RTD) consumption, giving Yili the opportunity to move from traditional wet bottle decontamination technology, it was previously using, to the Sidel aseptic blow-fill-cap with dry preform and cap sterilisation technologies.

“The country has recently enjoyed a period of sustained economic growth. As consumer income levels and spending power increase, the beverage market has seen a shift to more natural, 'healthier' beverages. In this category, innovation is key to succeeding and PET packaging is likely to be instrumental in this during the coming years​,” added Poupet.

He said traditional aseptic technologies use peracetic acid, which means the bottles have to be rinsed with chemicals or hot water. But, the Sidel Aseptic Combi Predis sterilises the preform by injecting hydrogen peroxide (H ​O ​) vapor into the preform, before the preform heating stage in the oven.",Yili turns to Sidel to launch Ambrosial Greek Yogurt in PET single serve bottles
"Búho Soda is Mexico's first all-natural, low-sugar soft drink made using locally-sourced ingredients, according to its manufacturer - and inspiration came from the country's booming craft beer movement, the start-up founder says.",04-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/py/9200074-1-eng-GB/py_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/28/Mexican-start-up-carves-out-niche-in-craft-soda-category,"The founder and CEO of Queretaro-based start-up Mima Sodas, Roman Gaa, originally comes from Germany but got to know Mexico when studying in Mexico City and then on a trip in 2014.

“One of the first things I noticed was all the fresh fruit and vegetables on every street corner. But something also made me very curious: the impressive soft drink consumption. It is such a big part of the culture here. At every meeting, reunion, and party there are massive volumes.​

“I thought ‘how is it possible that a country can be so rich in natural resources - fruit, agave, stevia – but doesn’t use them to make a good soft drink?’”​

At the same time, Gaa noticed the booming craft beer movement in Mexico, with new microbreweries opening all the time.

To him, this indicated that consumers were interested in craft, artisan products made with natural ingredients.

“I took the ideas of the craft beer movement and put them into a non-alcoholic​ beverage​,” he told FoodNavigator-LATAM. “I went back to my job [as a logistics consultant] in Germany but it took me about half an hour to decide to quit. I had no connection to food or the FMCG industry but liked the idea of this product.”​

After several kitchen experiments and 'sensory testing' trials with Mexican friends living in Germany, Gaa traveled back to Mexico in 2015 and founded Mima Sodas, launching the first product of the Búho Soda brand in 2016.

The start-up is currently working on new flavors and hopes to launch at least two more in 2019.

Sweetened with natural sweeteners stevia and agave syrup, Buho’s drinks contain around 60% less sugar than other commercial varieties.

“People know stevia and agave and see it as positive. Our customers are very curious, they are used to checking labels and reading ingredient lists, and sometimes ask us questions.”​

“For example, we are the only Mexican soda drink without any preservatives and people appreciate that. When they ask how why we don’t need them, we explain [...] that we pasteurize our products.”​

“As much as possible, all the juices are from Mexico and the final product contains between 95 and 98% locally sourced ingredients. We buy the organic blue agave syrup from Jalisco, for instance.""​ ​

'The tax made people aware soda has too much sugar'

Asked whether Mexico’s sugar tax has helped companies like his making lower-sugar products, Gaa said: “I’m convinced the answer to those kinds of questions [such as Mexico’s obesity crisis that has reached epidemic proportions] should come from the market, and that’s what we are doing. Let’s give people the choice between products with lots of sugar and more natural, healthy ones.”​

However, the entrepreneur recognizes that the public debate around the country’s sugar intake triggered by the sugar tax “definitely helped us”.​

“It made people aware they are drinking soda with too much sugar.”​

The start-up struggled to find a distributor in the first two years after its launch but taking part in Mass Challenge start-up accelerator last year helped it take off.

It now has listings in Mexico’s major retailers, including City Market, Fresko and La Comer (although most of its sales come from foodservice channels such as bars, and restaurants).

In Mexico’s “highly competitive​” soda market, Gaa preferred not to disclose revenue or sales figures but said around 60% of its business comes from sales in

Mexico with the remaining 40% from international markets, although its export business is growing more quickly.

Mima Sodas exports its soda to 16 countries, including the US, Canada and all over Europe but no Latin American countries so far.

Gaa attributes this to the premium price and glass bottle format.

“We didn’t want to use plastic but glass is heavier, more expensive and can get broken. When you include the cost of shipping, we can’t compete in markets where people want cheap options.”​

In Mexico, Búho Soda is between 50 and 70% more expensive than Coca-Cola (depending on the format) while there is a 10% price difference between Buho and imported soft drinks.

“Of course, if it is possible we would like to bring the price down but prices are increasing in Mexico at the minute because of inflation, and our suppliers are raising prices. At the minute, we are looking to offer other formats, such as aluminum can and bigger bottles, which could bring the price down.”​

This could also open up new markets around Latin America, he added.",Mexican start-up carves out niche in craft soda category
"Middle Eastern mineral water giant Agthia Group is focusing on functional benefits with its latest product launches, with intentions to expand further into the APAC market.",27-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-asia.com/article/2019/02/27/bringing-science-to-water-agthia-expands-functional-product-range-with-eye-on-apac-market/9176910-1-eng-GB/Bringing-science-to-water-Agthia-expands-functional-product-range-with-eye-on-APAC-market_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/27/Bringing-science-to-water-Agthia-expands-functional-product-range-with-eye-on-APAC-market,"Speaking to FoodNavigator-Asia​ at the Gulfood 2019 event, group CEO Tariq Ahmed Al Wahedi said: “We are the only company to bring science to water. Nobody else is doing that.”​

“Agthia as a company was based on elements such as innovation, food security and our corporate social responsibility initiatives are all also based on these two points.”​

Innovation is definitely a key focus of the company, with a focus on health benefits especially with bringing this to mineral water.

“[One of our new launches here today]​ is our Al Ain Zero Bromate drinking water, which is especially suitable for pregnant women and patients with kidney issues as it is light on the kidneys,” ​ said Al Wahedi.

According to him, bromate is a known carcinogenic-linked compound and although regular waters already do meet regulatory sanitary and health standards, going completely zero-bromate makes for a ‘worry-free’ product.

This follows on the success of other Agthia fortified mineral waters, including its market-first sodium-free water several years back, and its Bambini water for babies which was specially formulated to be used in baby formula or directly ingested without harmful ingredients such as sodium sulfate.

Agthia also produced a Vitamin D-enriched mineral water a year back, and the technology for this has been transferred into another of its newly-launched products: The region’s first vitamin D fortified flour, Grand Mills Vitamin D.

“Vitamin D is a big thing here [in the Middle Eastern region],” ​said Al Wahedi.

“We have a lot of sun but rarely go out and stay indoors in the air-conditioning all the time – this has led to some 80% of the population being vitamin D deficient and is the cause of many diseases.​

“Introducing vitamins as a fortification is nothing new, but [putting it into water] is challenging as it normally needs an oil medium. But we wanted to put it into water so that people can drink it daily [and] benefit from it with no other unnecessary stuff like sugar, colouring and so on.”​

He added that making the water available to the masses in terms of pricing was also a point of focus, so it was very economically priced at some AED2 (US$0.54) per bottle.

“We then took this technology for water and put it into flour, changing the concept to fortify [bread, which is one of the region’s staples]. Before this, putting vitamins into the oven would mean it disappears [upon heating],” ​he added.

Both the zero bromate water and vitamin D fortified flour will be available to the public in March this year.

Apart from these, Agthia also launched three other products at the event: Alpin Alkaline (a pH8.5, mineral water rich in alkalizing compound), Yoplait Lactose Free (a lactose-free fruit yoghurt), and Al Ain Water Bag-in-Box (BiB) (a unique new packaging form of water specially aimed to be used for outdoor gatherings, picnics and the like.

According to Al Wahedi, the company currently has a presence in the Middle East, Turkey, North Africa and Iraq, and have started exporting to Asia too.

“We have started exporting to China now, and our first shipment has just been sent to Singapore. We’re looking at discussions with Malaysia, and working on moving into Indonesia as well. We are definitely quite active in the [APAC] region,”​ he said.

“There are also very close discussions with Japan now, and they are very much interested in our Vitamin D products.​

“Each market [in APAC] is unique and has its own demands and requirements [but it is] definitely one of the areas we think will bring a huge value to our company​

“No doubt that when it comes to size and difficulty and complexity, China [takes the lead]. When it comes to the sophisticated consumer, definitely Japanese consumers are challenging because they are used to innovation.”​

He added that Agthia is also already active in Europe, in the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium, and is hoping to penetrate the United States market this year too.

When it comes to current trends in the F&B industry, Al Wahedi is positive that these present huge opportunities for Agthia.

“All of us know the pressure that is being applied to carbonated soft drinks. The sugar tax, the sin tax, everybody knows about it,” ​he said.

“At the same time, this opens a huge door for us and the consumer to realise that water is actually very ‘interesting’”​

“Nobody denies that at the end of the day, water is water and it is ‘boring’. But the consumer is hungry for innovation, they want something different, something special that is unique be it in terms of status or all-natural or with added functionality [and that is something we can bring].”​",'Bringing science to water': Agthia expands functional product range with eye on APAC market

Chocolate milk outperformed a commercial sports drink in a study looking at strength gains in adolescent athletes. But study—set up as a field trial—also highlighted the difficulties of translating lab results to the real world.,25-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/nutraingredients-usa.com/article/2019/02/25/chocolate-milk-performs-well-in-strength-test-with-teens-but-real-world-issues-complicate-study/9186329-1-eng-GB/Chocolate-milk-performs-well-in-strength-test-with-teens-but-real-world-issues-complicate-study_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/25/Chocolate-milk-performs-well-in-strength-test-with-teens-but-real-world-issues-complicate-study,"The study was conducted by researchers affiliated with the University of Texas at Austin and funded by Dairy Max, a group representing diary farmers in southwestern US states. It evaluated the effects of chocolate milk as post workout beverage, measured against a commercially available carbohydrate-based sports drink.

Population that has been little studied

The study was conducted with 103 male and female athletes participating in a summer strength and speed training program at a large southwestern high school. The authors noted that there were almost 8 million high school athletes participating in organized sports in the 2016-2017 season, according to a national federation. This amounts to a huge underserved market and one that has been little studied, they said.

The training protocol for the study lasted seven weeks. In week one, baseline tests were performed. Then followed five weeks of training, followed by post training testing in week seven. Baseline and post-test measures included height, body weight, bench press, squat, and power clean.

The authors noted that past research has show promise in combining carbohydrates and protein in a post recovery supplement. But many of those studies used specially formulated test materials that are difficult to find or too costly in a real world setting.

“One of the challenges of translating this research into practice is the use of controlled ratios of carbohydrate to protein within supplementation. Ratios that have been used in the laboratory are difficult to find in quantity and at acceptable cost within the general population,”​ they wrote.

Chocolate milk, however, is a convenient stand-in for these laboratory beverages, they said. It provides an attractive ratio of protein to carbs and includes an important does of electrolytes as well, the researchers wrote.

They used the Horizon Organic chocolate milk brand, which they reported provided 16 grams of protein, 44 grams of carbohydrate (as lactose, sucrose and cocoa) and 360 mg of sodium in a 473 mL serving that came in at 300 calories. The commercial sports drink was provided in a 710 mL serving, with 46 grams of carbs, 320 mg of sodium and 160 calories.

The test protocol was based on the training program’s existing structure. The junior varsity and female participants were instructed to find a weight for each exercise that they could lift a maximum of three times. The varsity male athletes did that same for a one-time repetition (the idea being that they had more weight lifting experience and so were at less risk of injury).

The authors said the study is “the first to test the effectiveness of a commercially available form of chocolate milk as a post-exercise recovery method on strength in adolescents in a field trial in comparison to the effects of commercially available sports (CHO) drink. The results indicated that the CM group had greater improvements in the composite strength score compared to the CHO group.”​

The authors said some of the difficulties they experienced in carrying out the study could be taken as lessons for future research. They had assumed that since most of the athletes had had previous training and the program itself was well established, the athletes would know how to do the lifts.

This was generally true for the bench presses and squats. But few of the athletes were familiar with the power clean lift, in which a bar is pulled rapidly from the floor to chest height. So the results of those lifts were of little use in forming their conclusions, they said.

This emphasized the need for thorough preparation and interaction with the training staff, they said. In addition, working with high school athletes means recruiting their parents, too, as most of these athletes are minors. The authors said they spent a full year laying the groundwork for the study.

“This study shows the importance of working with partners (high school coaches) during the planning stages of studies and training programs. The lack of control of the athletes’ diet and testing procedures were threats to internal validity, but the positive results inform the practice of these athletes. The study also guides the design of future research as it highlights the challenges and potential of these field-based designs,”​ they concluded.

In Metal Packaging Europe, volume mix grew by 3%, with broad-based increases in Bev Cans, which increased by 4% and food and specialty cans, which increased by 1%.

“Brand owners in all regions, most notably in Europe recognized the central role of metal packaging and we are supporting their growth with differentiated premium and sustainable packaging, while enabling them to meet their publicly stated targets​,” said Coulson.

“The level of everyday engagement with customers on this topic continues to increase and we are a committed partner in helping customers to meet their long-term requirements.​”

He said its commitment to delivering sustainable packaging was recently recognised for the fourth consecutive year, for example, with a gold rating by EcoVadis, a sustainability rating platform.

In other parts of the business, Coulson reported Glass North America's earnings were lower in the quarter and it will ‘continue to execute profit improvement initiatives’.

Q4 revenue of $2.4-$2.14bn increased by 1% and by 4% compared to the same period last year.

“Volume mix growth for the quarter, 1% comprised of 3% increase in metal packaging led by our beverage can businesses globally, partially offset by a decline of 1% in glass packaging where broad-based growth in Europe was offset by lower volumes in North America,​” he said.

Highlights for the quarter included volume mix growth in three of its four divisions, led by advances of 3% in both metal packaging Americas and metal packaging Europe.

“In North American Bev Cans we've seen an environment where the value for our products is certainly improving, but those margins are still relatively lower than what we have in Europe and elsewhere, but there is improvement coming and we have been negotiating improved pricing, which will come on stream next year and I think that will have a knock-on effect elsewhere in our market there​,” said Coulson.

“Groupwide volume mix in beverage cans increased by 5% in 2018 and with supported demand drivers we intend to invest in our customers' growth in 2019​.“

This will involve cans and ends expansion in Brazil with other targeted investments in Europe and North America.

Continued strength in Glass Packaging Europe, where packaging volume/mix increased by 2% in a strong market with a 3% decline in Glass North America.

“In North America, volume mix declined by 3% in the quarter, principally due to continued weakness in the beer category, partially offset by growth in wines and other beverages​,” said David Matthews, CFO, Ardagh Group.

“We are looking at growth in three of the four areas in Glass. North Americas is going to be pretty flat, but we do see growth in other areas.​”

According to Coulson there are lot of other steps being taken not just footprint optimization, but improvements in efficiency, profitability, and quality across its Glass sector in North America.

“It will take some time before it comes to the level of profitability, or the level of margin that we currently enjoy in Europe​,” he added.

“The European Glass industry is probably better invested than the US Glass Industry. It takes time for increased automation and inspection equipment to start taking effect and also improving the whole operating performance of the business​.”",Ardagh to differentiate premium & sustainable packaging to meet European demand
"Functional drinks currently represent a small slice of Brazil's non-alcoholic beverage market but recent regulatory change should encourage innovation and growth, says the president of Brazil's Association for Soft Drinks and Non-Alcoholic Beverages (ABIR).",26-Feb-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/alexandre3/9192268-1-eng-GB/Alexandre_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/02/26/Fueling-functional-Brazil-regulations-to-spur-beverage-innovation-says-trade-head,"Last year saw significant change to Brazil's regulatory landscape, with the introduction of a dietary supplement framework [RDC No.243/2018​] in July outlining use, claims and complementary labeling for nutrients, bioactive substances, enzymes and probiotics. Earlier this month, ANVISA - the country's National Health Surveillance Agency that implemented the framework - released updated guidance to assist implementation​.

Whilst the framework predominantly covers dietary supplements, it also regulates isotonic sports drinks – one of Brazil's most popular functional beverages alongside energy drinks, according to Brazil's Association for Soft Drinks and Non-Alcoholic Beverages (ABIR).

Functional juices were also recently regulated in Brazil under a separate law. Fortification of 100% fruit juices or 'full juices' with vitamins, fibers and other nutrients, for example, was regulated in September last year, under the Ministry of Agriculture's normative instruction number 49/2018 [Article 14].​

Alexandre Jobim, president of ABIR, said these regulatory changes would fuel continued growth in Brazil's functional drink category, which currently represented just 5% of the market for non-alcoholic beverages.

“Companies are looking to diversify through the launch of new products and some types of functional beverages have only been regulated in recent years in Brazil. .​..With the regulation of these products in recent years, we expect growth of this sector as we will have more options in the market,”​ Jobim told NutraIngredients-LATAM.

This, he said, aligned well with increased consumer desire for “beverages of greater nutritional value”​, particularly those enriched with vitamins and minerals, and a general wider interest in functional drinks.

Asked what product areas presented the biggest opportunities in functional, he said: “Fortified juices, teas, products with regional fruits and coconut water.”​

Jobim said other recent regulations to standardize regional fruits, including buriti, cajá, cupuaçu and umbu, among others, would significantly increase use of these ingredients. The Ministry of Agriculture standardized numerous fruits under normative instruction number 37/2018​ in October, last year.

Some of the regulations around use of regional ingredients, he said, were also still “in progress”.​

“At the request of the industries, ANVISA is currently evaluating the process of standardizing many regional herbs,” ​he said. “Some herbs are already in the Brazilian pharmacopoeia edition of 2010 and were already used in various alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. However, in 2013 ANVISA decided that pharmacopoeia would serve only as a basis for consultation on Brazilian herbs and vegetables, but wouldn't serve as a standard of legislation.”​ Examples included ginseng, jurubeba and catuaba, he said.

Jobim said that despite clear opportunities presented by regulatory change and a healthy interest among consumers for functional beverages, success would not be without its challenges.

“We think that the biggest challenge will be the way to communicate functional properties to consumers, because there are labeling and marketing restrictions in place by the Brazilian health regulatory agency ANVISA.”​

Mintel food and drink analyst Ana Paula Gilsogamo previously told us improved energy, fast hydration and natural were three important drivers for Brazilian consumers looking to try a new beverage​ and manufacturers should look to “invest in these claims”.​","Fueling functional?

And while it may be the world's largest brewer, AB InBev says it's proving the quality, heritage and individuality of such brands with 161 gold medals last year.

Designed to drive these brands forward, the High End is AB InBev’s business unit of global, specialty and craft brands that spans 22 countries, including the US.

Brands in the portfolio include craft beer acquisitions such as Goose Island, 10 Barrel Brewing, Devils Backbone Brewing,​ Four Peaks Brewing,​ Wicked Weed Brewing​ and Golden Road Brewing​. These sit alongside premium big brands such as Stella Artois, Stella Artois Cidre, Leffe and Hoegaarden, and home-grown craft style brand ShockTop.

“We expect the premium segment to grow about five times faster than core and value in the years to come,” ​says AB InBev. “Our High End Company is well positioned to capitalize on this trend and deliver high growth and profitability.”​

‘We’re the number one craft beer brewer in the world!’​

With the High End unit responsible for 10% of global revenue and 30% of global revenue growth, AB InBev dubs it the ‘#1 growth engine of the company’.

“​As consumer tastes for various styles become more sophisticated, craft and specialty brands become more essential for our growth,” ​said AB InBev CEO Carlos Brito, speaking in the company’s FY18 earnings call this month.

“And as a result, we have enhanced our portfolio across our markets to ensure we're relevant in this exciting and profitable space.​

“We're the number one craft beer brewer in the world with the portfolio more than 35 craft brands across 30 countries to meet the needs of every consumer occasion. ​

“Examples of the success of our craft business are the global expansion of Goose Island​​ - with brew house or brew pub locations now open in Brazil, Canada, China, Mexico, South Korea and the UK - as well the growth of our specialty portfolio.​

“In addition to positive recognition from consumers many of our craft and specialty brands have been widely recognized at beer competitions across the world. ​

""Our craft and specialty portfolio won 363 awards in 2018 including 161 gold medals at the 15 most prestigious competitions in the world. ​This is a testament to the quality, heritage and individuality of the brands within our portfolio.”​

As an autonomous unit that is part of a giant multinational, the High End unit is able to combine speed and agility with the economies of scale, says Brito.

He emphasises that it’s not just about having good brands: it’s also about having the right brands in the right place and the right time.

“For this reason, we established the High End company, an autonomous business unit with a focus approach to the premium segment. ​

""The High End company is currently in 22 countries which represents roughly 70% of the premium opportunity worldwide. Within these markets, we focus on the top urban centers and target the most premium points of consumption - such as craft beer bars, nightclubs and fine dining restaurants. ​

“The High End company is led by senior and experienced owners with specialized structure that combines the agility and speed of being independent with the scale of our core business.​

“It has established itself as the number one growth engine of our company, responsible for 10% of our total revenue, about 30% of our revenue growth. ​

Having identified a ‘significant opportunity’ for premium brands globally,​​ AB InBev says the High End business unit is well-placed to capitalize on the growth trend in this category. The brands within the High End Company command a premium and contribute higher margins that other products.

“In fact, premiumization represents our single biggest opportunity for growth,” ​continued Brito. “We estimate that the premium segment will reach more than 200 million hectoliters by 2020. ​

""This segment is expected to grow about five times faster than the core and value segment and - based upon our experience - it's a very profitable segment driving about two times more revenue for every hectoliter sold.​

“In summary, the premium segment represents a powerful combination of high growth and high profitability, and we're confident that our diversified portfolio of global craft and specialty brands is best positioned to capture this growth.”​

While craft beer has spearheaded the craft movement, craft spirits and other artisan drinks are following in its wake. AB InBev, too, is diversifying its craft and specialty portfolio outside beer.

Last month it announced its acquisition of San Diego’s Cutwater Spirits,​​ a maker of spirits and canned cocktails.

Cutwater – whose portfolio is made up of seven premium mixers, 14 canned cocktails and 16 spirits across whiskey, rum, gin and vodka – started life as an off-shoot of Ballast Point Brewing (before becoming a separate company after Constellation Brands bought the brewery).

Cutwater has a 50,000 square foot production facility in San Diego, with an accompanying bar and restaurant to explore new cocktails. It has experienced double and triple growth since inception and now distributes to 34 states.

“When we enter established categories other than beer, we try to do it from a disruptive angle,” ​said Brito. “So if we're entering spirits in a more serious way, we don't want to enter trying to do a me-too type brand, big brand, national brand. We're entering with a craft mindset.”​",AB InBev on craft and specialty beer: ‘The High End is the #1 growth engine of our company’

"Malt Products Corporation (MPC), which manufactures malted barley extract and sweeteners, has seen increasing demand for non-GMO and natural, nutritious ingredients.",06-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/bakeryandsnacks.com/article/2019/03/06/mpc-sees-demand-grow-for-non-gmo-natural-ingredients/9225338-2-eng-GB/MPC-sees-demand-grow-for-non-GMO-natural-ingredients_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/06/MPC-sees-demand-grow-for-non-GMO-natural-ingredients,"In response to this, the company has invested over $15m ($16.96m) in a drying plant, with a vacuum belt dryer designed and built by drying technology expert Bucher Unipektin.

MPC has grown from a regional supplier of malts to an international company offering a full line of natural sweeteners for the bakery, snack foods, cereals, confectionary and beverage industries.

The dryer is the culmination of a five-year, $50m ($56,56m) investment, beginning in 2015 with the expansion of its brew house, Meura mash-filter, expanded laboratory, R&D and customer application capabilities.

“The drying plant will continue our commitment to supply natural sweeteners, which are minimally processed and environmentally sustainable​,” said Amy Targan, president, MPC.

MPC chose the vacuum belt dryer over a spray dryer because of its ability to produce free-flowing particulates of viscous sugar syrups, as well as retain flavor, aroma and color.

The 58-foot-long machine has completed installation and validation, and is installed at the company’s Dayton, Ohio, US, manufacturing facility.

Vacuum belt dryers operate by reducing the pressure in the chamber and moisture is evaporated from the product at lower temperatures. This eliminates oxidation and prevents damage to the syrup.

Important to the drying of malted barley extract, vacuum belt drying uses a gentler process that protects unique-to-product characteristics not found in other sweeteners, including antioxidants, essential amino acids, minerals and vitamins.

Vacuum belt drying also helps avoid burnt notes or other off-flavors and aromas typical with spray drying, and better controls the maillard reaction for a more consistent final product color.

Vacuum belt drying produces a powder that is highly soluble in cold liquids, making it preferable for malt beverages.

The enhanced technology will allow MPC to manufacture products such as honey, agave and molasses that are difficult or impossible to dry on a spray dryer without additives.

Targan noted there has been a growing and renewed interest in MPC’s malted barley extract because of its unique flavor profile and recognition of its health-related benefits in the field of probiotics, plant-derived proteins, sports recovery and antioxidants.

MPC's malted barley extract is a multi-functional ingredient that acts as a natural humectant (moisture absorber), and enhances browning, fermentation, body and viscosity.

Founded in 1957 and headquartered in Saddle Brook, New Jersey, MPC also supplies healthy, natural sweeteners including molasses, oat extract, rice syrup, tapioca syrup, agave and honey.","MPC sees demand grow for non-GMO, natural ingredients in snacks, confectionery & beverages"
A farmhouse in northern Malaysia is the starting point for Izzy Nezs as it sets out to build a market for its bird’s nests outside the country and especially in Muslim-majority markets.,06-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/article/2019/03/06/bird-s-nests-business-booms-as-china-ends-tiff-with-malaysia/9108775-2-eng-GB/Bird-s-nests-business-booms-as-China-ends-tiff-with-Malaysia_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/06/Bird-s-nests-business-booms-as-China-ends-tiff-with-Malaysia,"The location, in the largely rural state of Kedah, has since 2010 provided a home to hundreds of pairs of swiftlets, or walet​, as they are known locally. The birds build nests from their saliva which can be harvested and sold whole, or formulated into beverage and health ingredients. Izzy Nezs’s does this through its Lumia brand which was launched last April.

Like many other bird’s nest suppliers, the company’s move into beverages was prompted two years ago by the partial reversal of a 2011 ban by China on the import of all bird’s nest products from Malaysia.

With the restriction on the export of specifically processed bird’s nests removed, Malaysian suppliers, now armed with their own food, beverage and cosmetics brands, have been able to ship these to the world’s biggest market.

The Chinese are especially keen on the supposed health properties of the nests, and view ones harvested in Malaysia as being particularly impressive. The market could offer vast riches to companies in what until recently has largely been a cottage industry.

Swiftlet farming is expected to contribute RM4.5bn (US$1.1bn) to Malaysia’s gross national income by 2020, according to official figures. With 20,000 swiftlet farmers, according to some estimates, the country exports about 60 tonnes of processed nests each year. It is currently the world's second biggest global supplier after Indonesia, producing an estimated 25 tonnes per month.

As the government entered final negotiations to lift the ban entirely last January, the agriculture minister highlighted the market’s potential.

“[The government] believes the industry can be a new source of wealth which will contribute to economic growth. Thus, we need to further develop the industry​,” Ahmad Shabery Cheek said after his ministry had signed an agreement protocol with China last January to resolve the issue between the countries.

The protocol would call on the Veterinary Services department to evaluate Malaysian bird’s nests to ensure that they met Chinese standards. It also sets the standards for Malaysia’s farmers to sell their raw nests to the Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Ministry.

The ministry will then export these “untouched​” nests to China where they will be cleaned and processed in Qinzhou, where it jointly owns a RM22m (US$5.4m) quarantine, processing and testing plant, and then sold to the Chinese market.

“When the ban was lifted for processed nests we joined a lot of other companies into manufacturing products like health drinks​,” said Fadzil Abd Latif, the husband of the founder and marketing advisor to Izzy Nezs.

“We entered into end-products because we have our own supply. The real difference is we introduced our products in a sachet format. It’s the first of its kind​.”

The high levels of collagen in bird’s nests means they are not soluble. Instead, processed foods and beverages featuring the material usually contain extracts or have it suspended in a jelly.

To allow their harvest to be turned into a sachet drink, Izzy Nezs looked for a way to transform their bird’s nests into powder. The company had previously used extraction on earlier versions of its products but soon the husband and wife team met a university professor who had patented a process that made powder from untouched nests and also ensured higher nutritional values than from an extract.

“From there we came out with a sachet to promote convenience. It’s easier to carry around than a bottle or a jar. You can just take out a sachet and have a shot when you want to​,” said Fadzil.

“We also customised it into two lines. There is one mixed with pomegranate and collagen for men and women. There is also one customised with ubi jaga and cordycep ​for men. Ubi jaga is botanical that’s even better than tongkat ali for male potency.""​

While China is “number one​” in the country’s sights, along with Japan and Indonesia, Lumia is also hoping to become the leading bird’s nest products manufacturer for the Muslim market at home and overseas thanks to its Jakim certification, Malaysia’s gold standard for halal.

In particular Fadzil is eager to tap into the Muslim pilgrim market. He feels that the sachet format and bird’s nest’s supposed energy and health properties will make for a good accompaniment to Hajj, the journey to Mecca which Muslims are required to perform once in their lives, and Umrah, which can be done regularly.

“I’m concentrating in Malaysia on Umrah, because it’s good for pilgrims​,” said Fadzil. “Sometimes they haven’t had time to eat breakfast and they’re rushing, so they can take ​out a sachet and get an energy boost that will last until lunch​. It also stimulates the mind for prayer​.”

“But first they need a lot more education to learn about the benefits of bird’s nests. The halal aspect definitely helps​.”

While he believes Muslim market holds tremendous promise, the reality is that Chinese consumers control almost the entire demand for bird’s nests. According to Fadzil, 99% of consumers are Chinese or of Chinese extraction. Bird’s nests have been used in Chinese cuisine and medicine for hundreds of years and there’s no need to convince the market of the health and healing benefits of swiftlet’s saliva. For Lumia its Malaysian origin is the key selling point for Chinese buyers.

Under the terms of the Sino-Malaysia deal to re-establish exports, a new regulatory system has given Chinese consumers supreme confidence in Malaysian bird’s nests and associated products.

“Malaysia is in the golden triangle of b​ird’s nest production. This includes Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand the the Philippines, but the Chinese prefer taking b​ird’s nests from Malaysia because the system is governed by our government​,” Fadzil explained.

“If you buy it from ​Indonesia, it’s only governed by an industry association. If one of that association’s members sells fake formulas, they can’t do anything. If anything happens in Malaysia, the consumer can sue the government. So the government needs to be responsible​.”

Indeed, there have been several reports of Indonesian bird’s nest brands passing off their products as Malaysian in an illicit bid to tap into this demand.

In Malaysia, bird’s nest farmers need to register their farmhouse with the veterinary department and Ministry of Health. Officers will visit to inspect compliance towards regulations and grant paperwork.

“It’s very strict and they can shut you down just like that​,” said Fadzil.

In terms of overseas expansion, Lumia is “not there yet​”. The brand already retails through the Muslim online store AladdinStreet. It’s also building a market in Malaysia and is looking to sell bulk orders to retailers. But China is the prize.

“Our online push into China is still ongoing.​ The market is so huge that just 1% of it would be ideal” Fadzil.​

“But in the meantime we are looking to Malaysia and other Muslim countries with our halal products​.”",Bird’s nests business booms as China ends tiff with Malaysia

Rabobank’s Brazil coffee crop survey indicates a 2019/20 crop of 57.6m bags: including 38m bags of Arabica and 19.5m bags of Robusta,07-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/news/markets/drones-and-new-harvesting-equipment-help-boost-brazil-coffee-crop/9229492-1-eng-GB/Drones-and-new-harvesting-equipment-help-boost-Brazil-coffee-crop_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/07/Drones-and-new-harvesting-equipment-help-boost-Brazil-coffee-crop,"“Both arabica and robusta estimates came in above our expectations,”​ says Rabobank, noting that it corresponds to the largest-ever down cycle for Arabica and a record conilon crop.

The Arabica tree typically has a biannual production cycle: with one year of high production followed by reduced production the following year (the down cycle). This pattern holds on a national level for Brazil, with most Arabica farms on a down cycle in 2019/20 after record production in 2018/19.

Rabobank also notes a ‘surprising’ lack of diseases or pests in most coffee areas. Meanwhile, new innovations - such as the use of drones - are being explored by farmers to help improve production.

These factors together all suggest 2020/21 could be another record crop year.

“The amount of innovation taking place in Brazil is quite surprising,” ​says Rabobank. “Drones are increasingly used commercially to monitor farms and also to spray different products. No farmer will do any of the main spraying rounds with drones, but they are excellent for experimenting with different products. ​

“Another key technological development is the potential future adoption of selective, fast-vibrating manual harvesters, which can revolutionize the way young Arabica trees and conilon trees are harvested. At only BRL 2,500 per machine, we can expect many trials to take place in large farms. It is of course early days for this particular technology, but low prices will incentivize these types of innovations, which are destined to reduce costs.​

“In any case, the energy we have seen in the Arabica and robusta trees, together with the absence of any major pests or diseases (except in Zona de Mata [which was affected by an outbreak of broca affecting around 8% of cherries]), could lead to fresh record crops of both Arabica and robusta in the 2020/21 crop year.”​",Drones and new harvesting technology help boost Brazil coffee crop
"Tetra Pak has launched the Tetra Classic Aseptic 65ml Cube package for dairy, juice, ice cream and liquid food.",07-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/ice-cream4/9228672-1-eng-GB/ice-cream_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/07/Tetra-Pak-addresses-waste-challenge-with-Cube-aseptic-packaging,"The dimensions of the package have been designed to allow every six packages to form a cube, to optimize the use of space in distribution and storage.

The package is available now with hand packing for secondary boxes.

It has been in use since December 2018 at a customer in Southeast Asia selling coconut milk as a cooking ingredient in markets where logistics infrastructure is a challenge.

“The Tetra Classic Aseptic 65ml Cube package provides a simple answer to the rising need of environmentally sound packages while saving cost for manufacturers​,” said Hemant Krashak, product director, Tetra Pak.

The package is part of Tetra Pak’s Classic Aseptic family, and its tetrahedron packages are known for their minimal use of packaging materials.

Compared to the traditional Tetra Classic Aseptic 65ml, the new package requires less secondary packaging and needs approximately 40% less space to transport the same quantity of products.

According to Roper Reports Worldwide 2010 ‘value for money’ is the single most important criteria for purchase for 47% of all global consumers. A product that wants to be competitive therefore needs to deliver quality, durability, convenience and indulgence as well as an affordable price point.

Tetra Classic Aseptic is suitable for juice drinks, milk, ice-lollies, culinary and viscose products and food can be delivered safely over longer distances, at lower cost, and made available to consumers at an affordable price.

""This innovation started with a package that has been in the market for more than 60 years. This is quite interesting as it shows that innovation doesn’t necessarily mean reinventing the wheel. In this case, it was about taking a traditional package and redesigning the basics – the dimensions of the package and using the geometrics to create something more exciting that is space efficient,"" said Hemant Krashak, product director, Tetra Pak.​ ​

""Unlike all other Tetra Pak cartons that are identical, the Tetra Classic Aseptic Cube 65ml comes with two matching ​formats to allow every six packages to form a cube. This means ​we need to modify the package-forming process in the filling machine, and the finished products need to be aligned in two rows for the hand-packing of the secondary packaging."" ​

According to its report; ‘Capture the fun Tetra Classic Aseptic Captured Affordability’, Tetra Pak claims the Tetra Classic Aseptic package uses the least possible amount of packaging material per volume of product of any container. Once empty, it folds down flat taking up very little space in the carton recycling bin.

‘Our aseptic technology enables food to stay fresh over long periods without the risk of contamination, loss of nutrition or changes in the taste of the product.

The Portman Group was founded to promote responsible alcohol standards and is funded by eight alcohol industry members including AB InBev, Carlsberg, Heineken and Molson Coors.

The key changes to the code are:
• A drink’s name, packaging and any promotional material or activity should not cause serious or widespread offence. Producers need to be careful when referencing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability and age on packaging or promotional material.
• Protection of the vulnerable has been explicitly added as an overarching principle.
• Single-serve, non-resealable containers shouldn’t contain more than four alcohol units (this follows the change in Chief Medical Officer drinking guidelines from daily to weekly guidance).
• A product should not suggest any association with illegal behaviour (the code already prohibits association with bravado or violent, aggressive, dangerous or anti-social behavior​.
• A product should not claim to have mind-altering qualities or suggest that it will change mood or behaviour (the code already prevents any suggestion that a product has therapeutic qualities or can enhance mental or physical capabilities.)​","The Portman Group sets out new standards, seeking to prevent offensive marketing"
Chanmé Frosé is gearing up for summer in the US with expansion of its ready-to-drink frosé pouches -- a frozen rosé wine that promotes portability often lost in the wine category. And the brand believes natural flavors and good wine will be the key to success.,07-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/entrepreneurs-launch-rtd-frose-pouches-to-tap-into-frozen-cocktail-craze_wrbm_large/9229696-1-eng-GB/Entrepreneurs-launch-RTD-frose-pouches-to-tap-into-frozen-cocktail-craze_wrbm_large_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/07/Entrepreneurs-launch-RTD-frose-pouches-to-tap-into-frozen-cocktail-craze,"The Frozen Frogs beverage company formed 'to fill a void' in the alcohol industry for better, expanded options of frozen drinks. Wine-based, frozen beverages are becoming increasingly common on bar menus, particularly in the summer.

But Frozen Frogs said that these imitation drinks tend to have a lower alcohol content and artificial flavors to cut corners and increase revenue. Pre-packaged mixed drinks have gotten a bad reputation in the US for using OTS (other than standard wine) or malt bases.

And frozen cocktails can have a chalky taste and are sometimes over-sweetened in proprietary batches at individual bars, limiting wider commercial viability. Frozen Frogs wants to reach that market, using only natural flavors and 100% real Rosé, Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Riesling and Sake wines.

Co-founder Jaxon Reilly told BeverageDaily, “Chanmé is different because, while still affordable to purchase, ​[we] spend more to use real wine and real flavors in the product. ​

""Chanmé wants to change the perception of frozen drinks and open the frozen RTD market up to everyone.”​

The Chanmé Frosé (6.9% ABV) launched with 10oz pouches in fall 2018 out of Charleston. It’s now available nationwide online, and at brick-and-mortar stores, bars and other venues in California, Nevada, South Carolina, Washington DC, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.

According to Reilly, “The packaging is designed to be frozen, and the drink quickly thaws and can be enjoyed in the packaging or poured out; just freeze, squeeze and frosé.”​

The Chanmé was created by Reilly and Dillon Bryan, and named for French slang that means ‘badass’ and ‘wicked.’ They originally intended for a warm-weather launch, but struggled to find a good production partner that had done similar work before.

“Due to the production delay, launching a frozen drink in October wasn’t exactly ideal, but allowed the team to focus its attention on marketing and building the brand the right way,”​ Reilly said.

The team formed a partnership with the Washington Capitals NHL hockey team and have been selling Chanmé consistently at the stadium all winter, which they consider a ‘good sign.’

They want it to be a year-round product, but are forecasting the summer months to be much bigger.

Millennials have been the earliest adopters of the Chanmé, which the brand finds unsurprising. Millennials have been the generation spearheading the popularity of rosé alcohol and the social media-friendly phrase ‘rosé all day.’

Reilly thinks that Chanmé launched at the right time because “millennials are dropping beer for wine and RTDs at record numbers.”​

The company is looking to expand in Florida and Texas next, but will first finalize two new frozen drinks over the summer with white wine and sake bases.",Chanmé on growing the frosé category: 'We want to change the perception of frozen drinks!'

"GEA has partnered with Gipsy Hill Brewing Company, in London, to install its Plug & Win centrifuge, which separates beer from unwanted solids such as yeast and trub.",12-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/gea5/9243733-1-eng-GB/GEA_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/12/GEA-says-its-Plug-Win-centrifuge-leads-to-better-beer-for-craft-brewers,"The company says the centrifuge is an out-of-the-box application ready for operation, easy to use and improves the taste of the beer.

“With the Plug & Win centrifuge, we are focusing on craft brewers who plan to raise their production to a professional level​,” said Peter Swift, head, separation sales, GEA UK.

“Customers in this segment want to brew more, but above all, better beer. We are convinced our centrifuge will enable them to take this step​.”

The Plug & Win has been in operation for a year. Sam McMeekin, co-founder, Gipsy Hill, said it needed intuitive equipment to accommodate its small team and to deliver a premium product without having to resort to shift brewing.

“The Plug & Win provides a host of advantages such as easy centrifuge handling and quick installation. The separator is a real plug-and-play solution and was set up within a single day​,” he said.

“Not everyone here is an experienced brewer, so user-friendliness is important. GEA was incredibly accommodating with the training. We picked everything up so quickly that we took the reins after two days and the GEA engineers came back a few weeks later to work through any questions that had arisen​.”

McMeekin added, its work ethic and mantra has always been about quality with regards to taste and its beer had become so popular it had an opportunity to increase its brewing capacity.

At the same time, it wanted to brew more efficiently while maintaining complete control over the production process, including consistency.

An earlier investment in inexpensive, and ‘unsuitable equipment’ taught the entrepreneurs to be demanding in their choice of technology.

“Investing in technology can be quite a stretch for small breweries. And although many of them are not aware of it, GEA offers a leasing option​,” added McMeekin.

John Taylor, production manager, Gipsy Hill, said with a centrifuge, beer clarification and turbidity can be adjusted precisely and reproduced, which accelerates the brewing process, because separated beer requires less time to clarify and mature in the storage tanks, allowing brewers to get the most out of their tank capacity.

“If it had taken 30 days to make beer, with a centrifuge it will take 25 days or less​,” he added.

“This centrifuge allowed us to shave four days off our production process per tank​.

“A separator operates very efficiently and extracts the residual beer from the yeast. Craft brewers are able to produce 20% to 30% faster using this method, and process even more batches in a row with consistently high quality and taste​.”

When adjusted for the finest level of clarification, a separator can replace filtration. Because many craft beers have a naturally higher malt and hop content compared to a pilsner or a lager, many of them are unfilterable.

However, if the separator operates at a low flow rate, it significantly reduces the yeast content and can have a positive impact on protein content.

Low molecular weight proteins, which flocculate in the beer during prolonged storage, remain, lending Indian pale ales the cloudiness that enthusiasts crave.",GEA says its Plug & Win centrifuge leads to better beer for craft brewers
"Philadelphia-based La Colombe Coffee Roasters debuted a Shandy-inspired RTD coffee collection last summer with Lemonade and Grapefruit. At Expo West in Anaheim last week it previewed a Cherry flavor, launching summer 2019.",12-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/la-col-1/9242505-1-eng-GB/la-col-1_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/12/La-Colombe-marries-citrus-and-coffee-at-Expo-West,"Citrus flavors are on trend in beverage launches​ this year, and La Colombe has brought the sour notes common in shandy beers to its ready-to-drink cold brew coffee formula. At the Natural Products Expo West show in Anaheim last week its latest RTD innovations were on display.

In addition to the Shandy collection, La Colombe also showcased two new 42oz bottles of cold-filled, cold brew multi-serves that are single-origin and organic, along with an Oatmilk Draft Latte.

At the end of summer 2018, La Colombe first introduced the Shandy line with Lemonade and Grapefruit flavors, calling it “the next evolution of coffee.”​ It considers itself a fourth-wave coffee company and a pioneer of the future of the industry, which is what led to the Shandy line.

Todd Carmichael, CEO and co-founder of La Colombe, said “We are always in search of what coffee can become and that is something that continuously drives us.”​

The brand called the citrus line a ‘natural fit’ with its nitro cold brew formula, as “citrus is a tasting note that is present in most high elevation, higher scoring coffee.”​ Its infused with nitrous and made with light-roasted Colombian organic coffee.

La Colombe prides itself on sourcing its coffee ethically and establishing long-term trade practices with growers, something it extended to the new fruit flavors. The Shandy line gets its lemons from centuries-old groves along the Mediterranean coast in Sicily, and cherries from the surrounding area of La Colombe’s production facility in Michigan.

“What we wanted this project to become is a coffee that is chug-able. This is not your average coffee. It’s the Arnold Palmer of coffee. It truly defies the limitations of the time of the day. This is an all-day kind of drink,”​ Carmichael said.

Kyle O'Brien, executive VP at La Colombe, told BeverageDaily the brand has continued to develop the Lemonade and Grapefruit formulas, so they may taste different now than they did at last summer’s debut.

The Cherry flavor was available for a special preview at Expo West, but won’t officially launch until July 1 in the 9oz slim cans.

The two new large-format multi-serve bottles are launching in Cold Brew Brazilian Medium/Dark Roast, which is made from single origin, fully washed and sun-dried coffee beans from Brazil; and Cold Brew Colombian Light Roast, whose beans come from the Sierra Nevada Mountains of Colombia.

“Multi-serve is something we’ve been thinking about for a while, but we waited until we could invent the technology to fill a bottle without heating up the plastic. It’s official. We have cracked that code,”​ Carmichael said.

“Ultimately what this is about is bringing home the absolute best cold brew coffee in America, to your refrigerator. We wanted to break down that wall where we become part of your morning routine and allow you the ability to customize your beverage how you like it.”​

Also on tap at Expo West was an Oatmilk Draft Latte, riding the trend of oat milk alternatives in the coffee space and the wider beverage industry. O’Brien said it would launch in can format within the next few months.

La Colombe’s existing portfolio of RTD Draft Lattes are available on-site at cafes and in retail, including Original, Triple Shot, Vanilla, Mocha, Caramel, Coconut, Coconut Mocha, Pumpkin Spice, Peppermint Mocha and Honeysuckle.

Since launching in 2017, the Draft Lattes are now sold at more than 55,000 locations and all of La Colombe’s RTD drinks have experienced 130% category growth. The brand operates 30 cafe locations in the US in New York, California, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington DC and Boston, with more expected to open in the new few years.",La Colombe marries citrus and coffee at Expo West

Under these frameworks, the sugar production process will need to meet criteria such as decreased and/or prohibition use of herbicides and pesticides, decreased water usage, natural systems management to protect the surrounding environment, reduced use of fossil fuels, have independent auditing and more.

“The switch to sustainably accredited sugar is a step forward for our overall operations, and also in meeting customer demand,” ​said Group Managing Director Alison Watkins, describing the move as a ‘good environmental and commercial decision’​.

“We have responsibilities to the community on resource use and renewal, and we’ve also heard customer feedback in favour of greater sustainability in the products we sell.”​

This move is part of Coca-Cola Amatil’s overall sustainability goals targeted to be achieved by the end of 2020, which includes a reducing its carbon footprint of its drinks by 25% (as compared to 2010) and using 60% renewable and low-carbon energy in its operations.

Coca-Cola Amatil has signed sustainable sugar purchasing contracts that will last until 2021.

The Coca-Cola Company also runs its own collaborative sustainability project together with the Australian government, the World Wide Fund for Nature and local resource management groups, deemed Project Catalyst.

This focuses on reducing the water and agricultural run-off by sugar cane plantations in Northern Queensland from entering the Great Barrier Reef.

Coca-Cola Amatil-owned Australian spring bottled water brand Mount Franklin also revealed sustainability initiatives of its own in the form of 100% recycled plastic bottles.

“[Our] Mount Franklin Still 350ml, 400ml, 500ml and 600ml bottles are now made from 100% recycled plastic, with a goal to move more of the portfolio to 100% recycled plastic in the future,” ​said Coca-Cola Amatil Director of Strategy and Marketing Gaelle Boutellier.

“Mount Franklin bottles are also 100 per cent recyclable. We’re calling on Aussies to keep recycling bottles and cans, so they can be reused again and again.”​

She added that 100% recycled plastic had ‘one of the lightest environmental touches’​ in terms of carbon footprint when it came to packaging.

"Stevia pioneer PureCircle says the new generations of the sweetener bring advances in taste, innovation and cost effectiveness.",11-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/stevia-getty-medinamedina/9206521-1-eng-GB/stevia-getty-medinamedina_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/11/The-stevia-story-has-changed!-PureCircle-on-the-natural-sweetener,"Headquartered in Chicago, PureCircle researches and develops stevia sweeteners. Its work includes improving the taste, mouthfeel and calorie profile, as well as addressing cost effectiveness. Founded in 2002, it has nearly 400 patents and patents pending covering proprietary stevia technology.

Stevia’s key advantages are its zero calorie status and its natural credentials. Problems with an ‘aftertaste’, however, had followed the sweetener for years: and it is often combined with sugar or other sweeteners to address this.

The stevia plant is native to South America, and has been cultivated there for hundreds of years. Today, it is grown around the world, notably in Kenya, China and the US.

Stevia is up to 400 times sweeter than sugar; and proponents argue that this high intensity means it requires less water and land to grow than sugar.

Major global regulatory organisations, across 65 countries, have approved the use of high-purity stevia leaf extracts in food and beverages.

Today, the industry is about developing a range of stevia sweeteners with PureCircle holding some 400 patents and patents pending.

“The story of stevia has changed significantly in the past few years,” ​PureCircle CEO Maga Malsagov told this publication. “Not long ago, stevia was viewed as a plant-based, zero-calorie, single-ingredient sweetener which worked well in some beverage and food applications.​

“Today we offer a range of new generation stevia leaf sweetener ingredients, including Reb M, with sugar-like taste and zero calories.”​

Last year the company increased its capacity to supply Reb M, a variant which is obtained from a proprietary strain of the stevia plant called Starleaf. Starleaf stevia plants contain more Reb M than conventional stevia plants, and PureCircle has ‘massively ramped up’ planting of this variety.

This is significant because previously, Reb M had only been available in small amounts in conventional stevia plants.

It is this kind of development that is driving the stevia industry forward, says Malsagov.

“Recent PureCircle advances enable us to significantly boost production of high-grade stevia sweeteners – like Reb M and Reb D — which have the most sugar-like taste and are highly sought after by beverage and food companies,” ​he continued.

“That means we can supply stevia sweeteners in amounts that customers need as they expand use of stevia ingredients – and we can do it cost effectively for them.”​

The use of stevia has broadened out as the sweetener has been developed. “​Our new generation stevia leaf sweeteners like Reb M work well in a wide range of beverage and food products. Stevia use is growing, and we are seeing stevia used in products ranging from ready-to-drink beverages to ice cream to baked goods to drinkable yogurts just to name a few.”​

‘New generations can innovate without any taste compromise’​

The issue of an ‘aftertaste’ associated with stevia has plagued the industry for many years. But Malsagov says today there are ‘no taste trade-offs or compromises’ with the sweetener.

“Today when we talk about beverages and foods sweetened with our new generation stevia sweeteners, we are talking about great tasting products – products which taste as good as their full sugar counterparts, but without the calories,"" ​he said.

“Aftertaste or linger was a characteristic of the early stevia leaf ingredients when used in some, but not all, beverage and food products. Today, food and beverage companies using our new generation stevia leaf sweeteners can formulate and innovate without any taste compromise.""​

While a number of companies have turned to stevia in their drinks, others have turned away from the sweetener. In the UK Coca-Cola’s Sprite started using a stevia/sugar blend in 2013 – only to switch out the sweetener last year​​ (using stevia had reduced the sugar content to 6.6g sugar per 100ml, whereas replacing the sweetener with a combination of sugar, acesulfame K and aspartame saw sugar levels drop to 3.3g and thus escape the UK’s sugar tax). On the other hand, however, it has developed a Coca-Cola using stevia as its sole sweetener: Coca-Cola Stevia No Sugar​​ was launched in New Zealand last May. With such a mix in take-up, critics can argue that stevia hasn’t been the silver bullet people once hoped it would be. But Malsagov counters that stevia is constantly changing. “​The stevia story has changed,” ​he said. “ The stevia of today is not the stevia of ten years ago. Our new generation stevia sweeteners have great taste - and no taste compromises. We believe the current rate of growth of products launched with stevia will accelerate. ​ “In addition, our advances with stevia have enabled us to ramp up production and become more cost friendly for beverage and food companies.”​",‘The stevia story has changed!’ PureCircle on the evolution of the natural sweetener

The company plans to accelerate the transition to more sustainable operations using non-fossil fuels, renewable energy, sustainable packaging and less waste with a number of initiatives to be announced this year.

Peder Tuborgh, CEO, Arla Foods’ said the decision ‘to have this new ambitious climate goal is farmer led’.

“Our elected farmer owners have been involved in the process of setting the ambition from the start, and they have shown great support and willingness to enter into a dialogue on how future dairy production should be organized​,” he said.

The target is set for all markets in Arla, however, some countries might reach the target sooner based on local conditions.

“Our 10,300 dairy farmers in seven countries have worked continuously to reduce emissions for many years. At this moment in time, CO ​ per kilo of Arla milk is already less than half of the global average. With new technology continuing to emerge, we are now taking the next step to further cut our emissions by 30% in 2030 and reach climate neutral operations by 2050​,” added Tuborgh.

He said it believes 2050 is a realistic target to become carbon neutral, but it will depend on the continuing development of technology within the industry.

“Based solely on the technology available today, we know we will be able to reach our 2030 target, and becoming C02-neutral by 2050 is a really important ambition to set as it drive a further improvements​,” said Tuborgh.

“We believe we can do it. Arla’s farmers are already among the most carbon efficient in the world and we have opened the world’s first carbon net zero dairy, Aylesbury.""​

Tuborgh said it believes more consumers are willing to pay more for their milk in the same way as organic dairy.

“From today we are starting to work with a group of progressive farmers in both Denmark and Sweden to offer more sustainable conventional and organic fresh milks​,” he added.

Arla will bring organic milk to market this year with its Arla 24 brand in Denmark and Arla Ko brand in Sweden.

Tuborgh said for obvious reasons it’s not possible to reduce a cow’s methane emissions completely, but it can be significantly reduced, for example through optimized feed composition, a research area Arla is investing in.

To counteract emissions, it is working with Arla farmers to quantify and increase the carbon captured and stored in the soil as part of increasing their positive contribution.

Since 2013, almost 700 on-farm meetings have been organized to educate groups of farmers on sustainability measures and more than 5,000 climate assessments have been conducted on Arla farms.

“We are driving CO ​reduction at farm level through our Sustainable Dairy Farming​ Strategy program​. Arla follows the internationally recognized methodology for carbon footprint calculations at farm level, developed by the International Dairy Federation​,” said Tuborgh.

“We have developed a farm carbon assessment tool and we have conducted carbon assessments at farm level for many years. To date we have conducted over 5,000 carbon assessments. Through these assessments, the farmer will get a performance status, benchmark against peers and advice on how to improve.​

“Arla farmers have reduced emission per kilo of milk by 24% since 1990 and the CO ​reduction from Arla’s operations such as packaging and transport has been reduced by 22% over the last 14 years. All while Arla’s milk intake has increased by close to 50%​.

“The Swedish and Danish society and our farmers are very much at the forefront of the sustainability debate. This makes Sweden and Denmark the logical place for us to start the work on how we make advances on organic dairy farming, and use the learnings in other markets over time​.”

Tuborgh said as part of its work to make its production more sustainable by reducing total CO ​ emissions by 30% per kilo of milk by 2030 and be carbon net zero by 2050, it will be communicating openly about the progress it is making along the way, including updates on its packaging set-up.

Jan Toft Nørgaard, dairy farmer/chairman, Arla Foods added, “We don’t have all the answers yet, but we call on our farmers, not least the younger generation of farmers, the industry, academic institutions and governments for collaboration and ideas that will support the transition to more sustainable farming and food production.” ​

Tuborgh said the company is in a ‘strong position to ensure people maintain confidence in dairy as part of a healthy and sustainable diet for the future’.

“Dairy is enjoyed across the world and plays an important role in providing nourishment to a growing world population – from a basic glass of fresh school milk to advanced whey proteins used in optimized medical nutrition​,” he added.

Last year, Arla created a digital database called Arlagården Plus to help Arla and the individual farmer to systematically measure and benchmark the farm performance.

So far, Arla farmers are registering data from 96% of Arla’s milk pool in the system on a quarterly basis, e.g. about their herd, milking system, feed, grazing, land use and animal welfare.

The next step is to include parameters that will indicate the farm’s impact on the climate and the environment, to identify best practice farms that it can learn from.",Arla Foods to accelerate its transition to sustainable dairy production

“Brands making ethical claims in China have half the number of Weibo followers than products making no claims. Premium trumps sustainability at present [in China],”​ Lumina Intelligence Analyst Oliver Nieburg told FoodNavigator-Asia​.

A detailed analysis of over 150 of the bestselling products across chocolate countlines, chocolate tablets, coffee, black tea and green tea sold by five major retailers in the country (Vanguard, RT Mart, Tmall, JD and Suning) revealed that just 9% of products made sustainable claims.

This was far lower than other regions of analysis, including India (15%) and Australia (33%).

Only four international MNCs in China were found to make sustainable claims: Unilever, Nestle, Mondelez and Cemoi. Of the four, Unilever made the most claims, although this made up just 4% of all the claims made in China.

Based on absolute numbers, Unilever was also found to make the most sustainable claims on its products globally, as per the Lumina team’s analysis of 20 other countries across the Asia Pacific, Europe, Americas and South African regions.

Products making sustainability claims in China were also found to be generally priced lower than those which didn’t, which contrasted significantly with the general trend in these other countries. In India especially, the average price of sustainable green tea, black tea and chocolate products had higher price points than those that were not.

“Paradoxically, products with sustainable claims in China are cheaper than products without claims,”​ added Nieburg, saying that this was partly due to some premium products such as Guylian (Lotte), Lindt and Godiva not making any ethical claims.

“[Overall], China is still a playground for ethical communications,”​ he said.

The most common type of sustainability claim in China was found to be the Rainforest Alliance Certified seal.

Some others used Mondelez’s in-house sustainability programme symbol Cocoa Life, but no sign was seen of the International Fairtrade Certification Mark.

This was directly in contrast with India, Australia and all of the 20 other countries analysed, where Fairtrade was found to be the most prevalent sustainable claim.

“China is a blank canvass for fair trade claims,”​ said Nieburg.

He added that: “Whereas third-party certification seals dominate sustainable communications globally, company programme labels like Mondelēz’s Cocoa Life are more prevalent in China.”​

As a category, green tea in China yielded the most sustainability claims at 57%, far surpassing its closest competitor black tea (29%) and chocolate tablets (14%).

Green tea was also found to rank at the top across all 20 countries analysed, taking an overall 25% across the board. In India, this trend was even more apparent, with green tea taking up 37% of all sustainability claims in total.

"At the ProFood Tech show in Chicago this week, more than 400 exhibitors showcased processing solutions for the food and beverage world, with particular focus on drinks, dairy and bakery. Greater focus on health and wellness and the rise in automation are shifting the market and inspiring steady US growth.",29-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/profood-2/9315163-1-eng-GB/profood-2_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/29/Health-and-wellness-drive-processing-trends-automation-innovation,"The world processing machinery market is estimated to be worth about $52bn, and growing annually 5.5%. Beverage machinery is growing the fastest at about 6.7% each year. The US processing equipment market is growing at 2.8%, a little slower than other developed markets, worth about $5.7bn.

Population, demographics, income and development of retail channels all contribute to the shift of processing trends, but the main driver around the world right now is the risen interest in health and wellness. Consumers are hyper-concerned about what’s on the label of the products they consume, including the formulation and ingredients.

People prioritize food safety and now try to stay away from additives and preservatives, though they want and expect products with a long shelf life. This has presented a new challenge for processing and packaging to develop and refine technologies that can improve shelf life.

Methods like high pressure processing (HPP), filtration and vacuum packaging represent some of the different technologies designed to make food and beverages last longer without additives. It becomes a decision for large and small brands alike - whether or not to invest in more expensive, thorough processing to meet consumer demand.

Jorge Izquierdo is the VP of market development for the Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies (PMMI), one of ProFood Tech’s producers. He spoke to BeverageDaily at the show about beverage processing trends and how the industry is responding to the adventurous, inquisitive millennial consumer.

With this wider shift in consumer perception also comes a change at the everyday level for brands. In the past, a small manufacturer faced more obstacles in getting to market, and it was more difficult to get products into large retailers like Target and Walmart.

“We’re finding more and more that those barriers are coming down. We’re finding small manufacturers are having the opportunity to compete and have their products in front of their consumers,”​ Izquierdo said.

The millennial consumers are less interested in big-name, inexpensive, ‘heritage’ brands and are more willing to research the best product and pay extra for it. It’s more common to find very specific products from smaller manufacturers, and that consumer demand is helping get them into more mainstream distribution channels.

“​[Millennials] recognize value and are more willing to pay for it. They are also more willing to try new things, try them and adopt them,”​ Izquierdo said.

He described customers as being ‘more inquisitive’ in general, causing manufacturers to improve their traceability and sterilization, and not just to comply with the required legislation. People want more than non-GMO and organic labels on their products, they also want the proof behind it. Companies are listening by including sourcing information on-pack and online, like animal health and farm tracking.

To accommodate these changes, there’s been a rise in processing digitalization and automation across all industries. In the past several years, manufacturers have struggled with a significant lack of qualified labour, further driving the need for automation.

According to Izquierdo, robotics innovation isn’t replacing human jobs, but rather filling the gaps in a weak workforce. It’s been a challenge at all levels - operators, technicians and engineers.

Now manufacturers need to recruit more workers able to handle the vast data being collected by the new processes. It’s still important to have qualified labor for added flexibility, but some of that flexibility is now being absorbed by technology.

Machines have become easier to operate, and the data collection is more accessible to display and monitor. The challenge is in analyzing the information, and the industry is improving in terms of developing new software platforms to assist this. Predictive maintenance and remote work is also becoming more common for all-size CPGs, not just the large operations.

There’s been a lot of investment toward flexible manufacturing, which is the ability to quickly switch from one product to another. Companies aren’t just looking for a fast machine, but one that can quickly adapt from one product to another.

“It’s getting easier to justify the investment in robots because of the ​[lack of] labour availability,”​ Izquierdo said.

“It’s really happening, it’s not just fancy words out there. It’s happening at reasonable prices, and it’s not just for very large operations or brand new, complete lines.”​","Health & wellness drive processing trends, automation innovation"

Anheuser-Busch debuted a Bud Light commercial during this year’s Super Bowl that slammed Miller Lite and Coors Light for using corn syrup in their beer. MillerCoors has now filed suit against AB InBev for “false and misleading advertising.”,25-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/article/2019/03/25/millercoors-sues-ab-inbev-over-super-bowl-ad/9282428-1-eng-GB/MillerCoors-sues-AB-InBev-over-Super-Bowl-ad_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/25/MillerCoors-sues-AB-InBev-over-Super-Bowl-ad,"Bud Light has used a medieval setting for its television commercials in the last few years, including the popular catch phrase ‘dilly dilly’ featuring the Bud Knight character. It’s also known for debuting new ads during the coveted Super Bowl commercial blocks every February.

This year it released a few ads, including ‘Special Delivery,’ a one-minute spot that depicts a barrel of corn syrup being delivered to Bud Light by mistake. Because they do not use corn syrup in their beer, the knights embark on a quest to deliver the barrel to Miller Lite and Coors Light for their brewing.

The ad sparked an immediate backlash, and MillerCoors has now sued AB InBev in federal court in Wisconsin, alleging the commercial is ‘false and misleading.’ In the official complaint, MillerCoors points out the difference between corn syrup and high-fructose corn syrup, which most consumers cannot determine.

“Under the guise of ‘transparency,' AB singled out MillerCoors use of a common brewing fermentation aid, corn syrup, for a deliberate and nefarious purpose: it was aware that many consumers prefer not to ingest ‘high-fructose corn syrup' or ‘HFCS,’ and had reportedly conducted extensive focus group testing in which it found that consumers do not understand the difference between ordinary corn syrup (used by numerous brewers, including AB itself) and HFCS, the controversial sweetener commonly used in soft drinks.”​

Since corn syrup is used as a fermentation aid, MillerCoors explains it is never in the glass, bottle or can of Miller Lite or Coors Light that consumers drink. Bud Light also released three 15-second commercials detailing the ingredients difference between the beers.

“AB also uses corn syrup as a fermentation aid in several of its products across various price points, ranging from above-premium brands (such as Stella Artois Cidre, Stella Artois Spritzer, and Bon & Viv Spiked Seltzer) to economy brands (Busch, BuschLight, Natural Light, and Bud Ice),”​ the complaint says.

Since the Bud Light commercial aired last month, MillerCoors has hit back with commercials of its own, parodying the medieval setting of Bud Light’s ads by showcasing the same characters drinking Miller Lite.

Two Miller Lite spots: ‘Aftermath’ and ‘Snow’ aired on television, digital and social channels starting last Thursday during the NCAA college basketball tournament. Coors Light also dropped a commercial advertising a new tap that ‘listens for Bud Light negativity.’

Anup Shah, VP of the Miller Family of brands, said “While Anheuser-Busch is living in a fantasy world, we’re focused on making sure people here in the real world know Miller Lite has more taste, fewer calories and half the carbs of Bud Light.”​

Bud Light issued another short ad in reply to the new MillerCoors commercials, which says, “If you’re this set on imitating our kingdom, may I suggest also imitating us by putting an ingredients label on your packaging. People want to know what ingredients are in their beer.”​

In the lawsuit, MillerCoors “seeks to set the record straight, enjoin AB’s false and misleading advertising claims, and obtain monetary and other relief for damages incurred.”​",MillerCoors sues AB InBev over Super Bowl ad
"Coca-Cola dips into alcohol alternatives with the launch of Bar None, a collection of ready-to-drink mocktails. It's a new look for Coke with a “shift in the growth mindset of the company” that is “adopting more growth behaviors, being curious, taking more risks.”",26-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/bar-none-5/9223296-1-eng-GB/bar-none-5_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/26/Setting-the-bar-Coca-Cola-invests-in-mocktails-with-internal-RTD-line,"With more young people developing an interest in low-ABV and non-alcoholic drinks, more brands are popping up to cater to them. Alcohol-free beer and housemade mocktails have led the pack on-premise, and now RTD options are entering the market.

Bar None was born out of the Venture & Emerging Brands (VEB) division of Coca-Cola as a ‘personal passion project’ of longtime employee Sabrina Tandon. VEB works with future-forward beverage concepts, focusing on what beverage consumers might be drinking in a mainstream way within the next 5-7 years.

The brand is wholly owned by Coca-Cola, but still operates independently. It was developed outside Coke’s system using external R&D and distributors. Tandon thinks it’s important that Bar None still has a separate, entrepreneurial spirit from the company.

She believes the climate was ripe for Bar None thanks to alcohol consumption patterns, noting that today’s consumers are very health engaged and look to social influencers that drive trends.

“In the past couple of years ​[Coca-Cola] has had a big shift in the growth mindset of the company and adopting more growth behaviors, being curious, taking more risks. These are all behaviors that have been a new focus area for the company. I think the timing was perfect for an initiative like Bar None,”​ Tandon told BeverageDaily.

According to brand research from Coca-Cola, 18% of US consumers are abstaining from alcohol and 35% of regular drinkers are seeking out non-alcoholic options. The younger Gen Z and millennial generations are drinking less as they age, focusing more on their health and indulgences other than alcohol.

Though young consumers are trending away from alcohol, Bar None’s initial sampling of customers doesn't skew to just those in their 20s. It ranges from ages 25-50, representing “more of a mindset than a demographic.”​ Tandon said those reaching for Bar None have moved past the ‘drinking for fun’ phases in their lives and are looking for an alternative at social gatherings.

People want something more than a soft drink, but something less than hard alcohol. This spurred Tandon to choose the mocktail path and develop four options that were alternatives to drinks other than beer.

The brand is launching first with Spiced Ginger Mule, Bellini Spritz, Dry Aged Cider and Sangria. Tandon explained at first she wanted to just explore wine alternatives, but discovered she couldn’t quite reach the exact benchmark of wine. Consumers have high expectations for alternatives and trying to precisely replicate it wasn’t realistic.

The Sangria drink she did come up with is ‘reminiscent’ of wine. She also chose to develop a cider rather than enter the crowded beer alternative market. The mule decision came from ginger’s recent popularity as a trendy ingredient, and the peach Bellini won out over a few other cocktail options after testing well with consumers.

It was important to Tandon to differentiate her products from the soft drink category, which put an emphasis on choosing the right packaging and label graphics. She wanted the dark glass bottles to protect the natural flavors and ingredients from UV rays, but also to indicate the drinks are separate from the packed market of fizzy drinks.

“It’s creating a new category, which sounds a little odd because yes, it’s a carbonated beverage. But in terms of where it would live in a store, it doesn’t make sense to be near soft drinks but to put it in the beer and wine aisle is confusing too,”​ she said.

The Bar None brand is sold nationwide online and at about 25 brick-and-mortar locations in Atlanta. Tandon said there’s still a lot of testing planned before any further expansions, but imagines it would first grow in the southeast.",Setting the bar: Coca-Cola invests in mocktails with internal RTD line
Genius utilizes the entire coconut in its ready-to-drink smoothies by blending the coconut water and meat together. It sources and bottles in Thailand before shipping and distributing in the US.,26-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/genius-5/9294543-1-eng-GB/genius-5_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/26/Zero-waste-whole-coconut-smoothies-make-Genius-move-to-conventional-retailers,"Alex Bayer had the idea to bring something beyond coconut water to the US market after a friend made him a smoothie blended from coconut meat and water. After he tasted it, he thought it was a ‘genius’ idea to use the whole coconut in a single beverage product.

Bayer spoke to BeverageDaily and described the drink as more of a meal replacement or supplement as compared to traditional coconut water. His smoothies also have half the sugar content of coconut water because the coconut meat balances it out.

He finds the lighter and less pungent taste and texture are winning over customers that were previously averse to coconut water. They are thicker and more filling, containing potassium, electrolytes, good fats and 4.3g of MCTs per bottle.

“Coconut water can be very polarizing. You either love it or you don’t. But we’ve converted a lot of people who don’t really like coconut water, and they actually really like our product,”​ Bayer said.

Genius got its start in southern California in 2014. Alex and the team have gone through three manufacturing partners in the last four years before settling on a vertically integrated facility in Thailand. The partner sources the coconuts themselves, then extracts, blends and bottles it in Thailand before shipping to the US.

“It took three years to find the right partner who could make the product with the right quality and scale it so we can grow with them as volume and demand grows in the states,”​ Bayer said.

The variety of young Thai coconut that Genius works with is naturally sweet, eliminating the need for added flavors and sweeteners. In the original product, there are two ingredients: organic coconut water and organic coconut meat.

Just last month, Genius added two flavors to the brand - Turmeric and Coffee. Bayer said he researched what flavors were trending in the natural channel and spilling over into the higher end conventional channel. They also wanted to focus on ingredients that are more functional and bring functional value to the customer.

Turmeric is an anti-inflammatory and is growing by about 40%-50% year-over-year. Cold, caffeinated RTD drinks are increasing annually as more young consumers gravitate toward the grab-and-go cold brew market.

Genius prides itself on being a zero-waste, mission-centric company. They donate the coconut husks to be upcycled in Thailand after the meat and water are extracted. The husks are converted into coconut charcoal and alternative energy.

The smoothies are now sold in more than 1,100 stores in seven regions throughout the US, including select Whole Foods. He wants to focus on expanding to more conventional retailers this year, with limited launches in Target and Sprouts stores later in 2019.

Genius kicked off its mainstream retail push at the Natural Products Expo West show in Anaheim earlier this month. The team met with representatives from major stores like Walmart, HEB, Wegmans and Safeway.

Bayer said they were all receptive and interested in the smoothies because most larger retailers are expanding their functional set. More kombuchas and adaptogenic, probiotic drinks are cropping up outside traditional specialty stores as consumer demand grows.

At the Expo West show, Bayer found drinks containing functional ingredients like MCTs and good fats were a big hit. They are more about meal replacement with less sugar and more fiber. He also feels the large market of plant-based food and drinks “is definitely here to stay.”​","Zero-waste, whole coconut smoothies make ‘Genius’ move to conventional retailers"
"Diageo, Unilever, The Coca Cola Company, and Nestlé have launched the Africa Plastics Recycling Alliance at the Africa CEO Forum in Kigali, Rwanda.",26-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/info2/9296182-1-eng-GB/info_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/26/Diageo-Unilever-Coca-Cola-Nestle-launch-Africa-Plastics-Recycling-Alliance,"The 7th edition of the forum (March 25-26) saw more than 1,800 CEOs from top African brands, international investors, and policy makers from 43 African countries and 26 international countries, recommending more reforms to accelerate African economic integration. It was the first time it was held in East Africa.

The Alliance was set up to challenge plastic waste in Sub Saharan Africa by creating jobs and commercial activity to improve the collection and recycling of plastics.

The companies will support their local subsidiaries to engage in public private partnerships, industry collaboration and alliances; share knowledge, participate in local pilot initiatives; and engage with policy makers to accelerate the development and financing of waste management infrastructure and systems.

Speaking on behalf of the Alliance, Gabriel Opoku-Asare, head Diageo in Society Africa, said unfortunately, a lack of collection and recycling capacity in many African markets coupled with growing populations is creating a growing problem of plastics waste.

“Plastics will remain an important packaging material if we give African consumers safe and affordable products. However, we need to ensure the packaging used ends up in the right place​,” he said.

“We see an opportunity to tackle that problem in a way that creates jobs and reduces dependency on imported materials while alternatives to plastics are developed​.

“Collaboration within and across markets will be key to success so we are proud to launch the Africa Plastics Recycling Alliance to increase those efforts and play our part as companies in finding solutions that work for Africa.”​

Alliance members already have individual commitments to tackle plastics waste and collaborate through global collective action, such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment and national institutions and platforms in various markets.

“Any initiatives we develop under this collaboration will aim to have comprehensive plans, will be appropriate to the local context and will be consistent with the principles of the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment,​” added Opoku-Asare.

Organized by Jeune Afrique Media Group and Rainbow Unlimited and co-hosted by the IFC, the Africa CEO Forum was themed around using regional integration to drive private sector growth.

The Forum is, according to experts, an opportunity for Africa to discuss the implementation of the CFTA (Continental Free Trade Area), which is billed as a potential driver for private sector growth.

Amir Ben Yahmed, president, Africa CEO Forum and MD, Jeune Afrique Media Group, said economic integration is not an opportunity but a necessity which cannot happen without the private sector.

“Putting leaders at the forefront of economic integration is what the CEO Forum is all about and what Africa should be doing to achieve economic excellence​,” he said.

“Regional integrations hold great promises. Therefore, increasing intra-Africa trade while eliminating non-tariff barriers is critical for Africa’s economic success,” added Philippe Le Houerou, CEO, International Finance Corporation (IFC)​.

Ivano Tonutti, master herbalist, Martini, said the drink’s zesty, bitter-sweet orange flavour has been created to pair with tonic water.

The 50/50 serve answers the growing consumer appetite for longer, more refreshing ways to enjoy vermouth as part of the aperitivo occasion – an Italian way of life that is steadily establishing a home away from home in the UK.

“Creating Martini Fiero was an exercise in balance. From a botanical point of view, it was essential to harmonise the vibrant citrus notes of the Murcia orange peel with the bitterness and herbal aromatics of the Artemisia​alongside the many other botanicals, which in turn had to sit happily alongside the quinine in tonic,” said Tonutti.

‘Fiero’ means ‘proud’, ‘intense’ and ‘bold’ in Italian, reflecting Martini’s heritage and history and flavourful character of the vermouth.

""We worked hard to ensure the intense flavours of our white wine and citrus core would come through when the tonic is added. We are proud of the result – a modern vermouth with a distinctive bittersweet orange flavour that comes to life when paired with tonic,” added Beppe Musso, master blender, Martini.

This is spreading to alcohol, and influencer marketing platform Traackr analyzed how alcohol brands are engaging with the new trend.",21-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/article/2019/03/21/traackr-dives-deep-into-the-influencers-of-alcohol/9278325-1-eng-GB/Traackr-dives-deep-into-the-influencers-of-alcohol_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/21/Traackr-dives-deep-into-the-influencers-of-alcohol,"There has been an increase in the premiumization of alcohol despite the overall decline in alcohol consumption. It’s resulted in consumers choosing more expensive products that have slightly boosted revenues.

In 2018, the spirits and alcohol industry reached sales of $253.8 billion, up by 5.1% from 2017. Particularly among the younger generations, high quality wins out over high quantity.

To drive consumers to the premium products, brands are utilizing social media promotion and influencer partnerships. As Traackr’s report ‘2019 State of Influence: Spirits, Beer and Wine’​ says, most alcohol brands are warming to the idea of paid content, and establishing “powerful, effective and compliant influencer programs that speak to target audiences.”​

Traackr analyzed cocktail trends, gin, whiskey and vodka brands, mass-market beer, hard cider brands and wine varietals along with 9,000 social media influencers working in these categories with audiences in North America and Europe.

According to Traackr, “Classic drinks such as martinis and manhattans lead the cocktail conversations among influencers, but content about margaritas gets the most engagements. Gin and whiskey are the top types of spirits garnering mentions and engagements.”​

Sipsmith leads the gin conversation​ across social networks with the most activated influencers and mentions in the category. Jameson comes out on top within whiskey influencers and mentions, but slips to fourth place in engagements.

Chardonnay is the most popular wine varietal when it comes to influencer mentions, but Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon top it in engagement rate. Barefoot Wine leads in brand mentions on social media, even though their influencers have a low engagement rates.

Hard cider has been experiencing high volume growth since 2012, and Strongbow has the most active influencers and mentions, but again slips in engagement rate. Angry Orchard is one of most well-known cider brands in the world, and it manages to consistently return strong numbers on social media in all categories.

Traackr notes that there is a clear difference in performance between mass-market and craft alcohol. Mainstream brands may work with more influencers and have a wider reach, but it’s the craft brands that tend to return a higher engagement rate.

The report said that smaller craft breweries like Russian River Brewing Company generate influencer posts with approximately double the overall engagement rate compared to big beer brands like Michelob Ultra.

It also reveals that Guinness has the highest number of activated influencers across all categories, but only has the fourth highest engagement rate among mass market beer.

Mainstream alcohol tends to have a wider reach for TV, radio and billboard advertisements, while small craft brands rely the power of social media and word-of-mouth to market their products.

Pierre-Loic Assayag, CEO and co-founder of Traackr, said “Across the board, mass-market beer brands perform poorly among influencer generated content, signaling a trend we’ve seen across consumer segments - people will pay a premium to associate themselves with brands whose purpose transcends their product.​

“Alcoholic beverage brands that connect through authentic conversations from trusted sources will stay relevant and continue to grow in the current downturn, while others will be further commoditized and will struggle with sales and margins.”​","Cocktail conversations: Social media influencers and their impact on spirit, wine and beer brands"

Since re-launching the dairy closure, where the original weight was 2.2g, the total reduction has been 41%. The applied changes in knurling design contribute also to reduce the required force to open a container by an end user.

“Currently 70% of the tooling capacity has been converted to run Stealth with the project continuing until all have been converted,” ​said Jones. ​

“There will be further scientific work commissioned once this total market conversion has been completed, however PACCOR’s Design Team has already begun conceptual work on the next-generation of this closure.”​ ​

Companies that have already signed up to the caps include Müller​ which rolled it out across its own-brand and private label fresh milk products from February 2019.

Müller’s HDPE fresh milk bottles are already 100% recyclable and the business wants to increase the use of recycled plastic in its bottles to 50% by 2020.

The dairy company has already completed various acquisitions throughout the UK that allows the business to manufacture its own fresh milk bottles in the UK.

Due to the success of the caps, PACCOR UK has begun to apply similar design principles and technology to conceptual injection moulded cream-pots on its IML product range.

Juergen Lehmann, sales director international, PACCOR, added, as a result, PACCOR (Mansfield) UK will reduce plastic usage on a much bigger scale without compromising the performance of its products. ​

“The 13% reduction in weight of each cap will equate to approximately 600 tons of plastic used in the company’s production thanks to PACCOR’s production capacity of 3 billion caps every year,” ​he said.",PACCOR to extend next-generation lightweight bottle caps across IML portfolio

"You could say Carlton & United Breweries has been bitten by the green bug. But it might be more accurate to suggest a seven-foot inland taipan has chomped on a very fleshy part of the Australian brewery major, so keen has it been to burnish its eco-credentials.",22-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/karadoc/9248275-1-eng-GB/Karadoc_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/22/Building-a-sustainable-business-Carlton-United-Breweries-on-solar-power-and-sustainability,"Central to its sustainability approach is its commitment, announced a year ago, to source all of its electricity from renewable sources.

There have been other environmental moves, of course, like the decision to stop using plastic rings on the six-packs of beer it sells, but the energy matter is the big one.

It was announced last year, when CUB signed a 12-year power purchase agreement with a German renewable energy developer to build a 112MW solar farm with the capacity to power 65,000 homes. It recently came online.

'If we want to be around for another 180 years, we need to create a sustainable business'

Covering 664 acres on the border between Victoria and New South Wales, in Karadoc, near Mildura, CUB has described the facility as a “major step forward in Australia’s renewable transition​” while stressing its contribution to the local economy after 300 jobs were created to construct it.

Its 330,000 photovoltaic cells convert Australia’s abundant sunlight into green power. Under the dozen-year deal with BayWa r.e. Solar Projects, CUB will be supplied with 74,000 MWh per year of electric power. This takes the brewer a step closer to its goal of sourcing all of its electricity from renewable energy.

“This is a major step towards us achieving the ambitious target we set ourselves to have 100% of our purchased electricity sourced from renewables by 2025, a goal we are confident of achieving well before then​,” CUB’s sustainability manger, Kirsten Sturzaker, said at the ribbon-cutting on February 28.

She went on to voice the brewery’s new favourite mantra, that “we have a history stretching back 180 years, ​but if we want to be around for another 180 years, we need to create a sustainable world and a sustainable business​”.

In addition, the solar farm will reduce CUB’s power costs and secure its energy supply for the long-term in a sustainable way.

The brewer and BayWa r.e. are currently working on the next 106 MW plant at a nearby Sunraysia location.

“Karadoc was delivered on time and on budget in under 12 months and made a major contribution to the local economy. The power supplied to CUB and Flow Power is now helping Australian business transition to renewables,​” said Benedikt Ortmann, managing director of BayWa r.e..

Peter Filipovic, chief executive of CUB, said in addition to the Karadoc plant, the brewery is also moving towards onsite solar generation, which will see solar panels on the roofs at each of our breweries.

“Everyone has a responsibility to play their part to tackle climate change. CUB is no different. We are absolutely committed to delivering on an ambitious environmental and sustainability agenda,​” said Filipovic, who took the top role at the brewery in January.

“The investment also stacks up when you look at the reduced price we will be paying to power our operations. Moving to renewable energy will ensure that we have certainty of supply and pricing​.”

The high-volume brewing industry is highly energy intensive, requiring a number of processes that require large amounts of electricity. Over the last 30 years, Australian brewers have been involved in a number of different energy management and sustainability programmes, though critics claim their efforts have not been sufficient.

In addition to its fully sustainable electricity ambitions, CUB has committed to going either completely plastic-free or using recycled plastic by 2025. In addition, it is aiming for 100% of its products to be in packaging that is returnable or made from majority-recycled content by 2025.

To this end, the firm’s Cascade Brewery in Tasmania discontinued plastic six-pack ring packaging​ on cans last August, while last week it announced its VB and Carlton Draft-manufacturing Abbotsford brewery would no longer use plastic six-pack rings on cans, in favour of new cardboard packaging, saving more than 25m of them from entering the environment each year. In coming weeks, the brewer will take 137 tonnes of plain shrink wrap out of the system.

After voicing the usual 180-years past, 180-years ahead mantra, CEO Filipovic added: “We’ve sourced and tested new packaging, installed new equipment, and now the new packaging is running off the canning line​.”

Of course, CUB’s approach closely mirrors its parent, AB InBev’s sustainability goals.​ And following it guarantees it an updated narrative about the origins of a pot or schooner of lager.

More than anything though, this green bug appears to be providing an opportunity to talk to a new generation of more environmentally interested consumers at a time when Millennials are fast getting a taste for craft beers.",Carlton & United Breweries' amber ales start going green
Japanese beer maker Sapporo Breweries is to devote more attention to so-called ‘third category beers’ – those which use malt alternatives such as soy and pea protein - in its home market this year.,25-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-asia.com/japan/third-category-beer-malt-alternatives-a-focus-for-japanese-giant-sapporo/9257639-3-eng-GB/Third-category-beer-Malt-alternatives-a-focus-for-Japanese-giant-Sapporo_wrbm_large.png,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/25/Third-category-beer-Malt-alternatives-a-focus-for-Japanese-giant-Sapporo,"The firm says such products are becoming more popular among consumers and manufacturers due to its low tax rate.

“Because of forthcoming consumption tax increase, consumers tend to buy cheaper products such as the third category beers,”​ Mika Harada, Senior Manager of the Public Relations section said in response to queries from FoodNavigator-Asia.​

Japan had previously announced that the consumption tax would increase from the current 8% to 10% on Oct 1 this year.

In addition, the firm hopes to build on its existing strength in the regular beer segment.

“We have a strong brand in the regular beer category. Even though the beer drinking population is shrinking, our brand ‘Black Label’ is getting popular among the young generations. Therefore we will continue to focus on it,” ​she said.

“Black Label” saw four consecutive years of sales growth. Since 2015, sales have been growing by at least 100% each year.

Last year, “Black Label” also shot to the second most popular spot amongst all other beer brands amongst consumers in their 20s, according to True Data supermarket panel. In 2016 and 2017, the product only came in at the 7th​ and 6th​ place respectively.

On the other hand, it is important to note that although the tax rate is lower for happoshu (quasi-beer) and the third category beers, the government has plans to flatten the tax rate across all beer categories by 2026, which will close the price gap between the different beer categories.

The government plans to impose a similar tax rate by reducing the tax on beer and increasing the tax on happoshu and third category beers in stages, The Japan Times​ reported.

Last month, the Tokyo District Court dismissed Sapporo Breweries’ request for a US$105m tax refund of its third category beer Goku Zero.

Sapporo Breweries first sold Goku Zero in June 2013 as a third category beer. The firm suspended shipments of Goku Zero in the following year after the authorities said that it might fall under another category of beer that came with a higher liquor tax rate.

The firm later sought the return of US$105m tax paid in additional liquor tax after determining that the original product was a third category beer that came with a lower tax rate.

Since July 2014, the firm also changed the production process of Goku Zero and sold it as a happoshu beer.

In the latest development, the court decided that the product could not be classified as a third category beer.

In response, the firm said in a statement that it would determine how to respond to the matter based on the review of the judgement and consultation with the legal counsel.

It also claimed that there was no impact to the company’s business performance.",Third category beer: Malt alternatives a focus for Japanese giant Sapporo
"2019 will be a year of change. With increased purchasing power, empowered consumers are pushing brands to embrace their values. Connected consumers are finding the joy in disconnecting. Older consumers want to feel and be treated as younger, says Euromonitor.",28-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/article/2019/03/28/euromonitor-top-10-global-consumer-trends-2019/9308734-1-eng-GB/Euromonitor-Top-10-Global-Consumer-Trends-2019.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/28/Euromonitor-Top-10-Global-Consumer-Trends-2019,"According to Euromonitor Internationals’ report; ‘Top 10 Global Consumer Trends​ 2019’, by Alison Angus, head, Lifestyles Research, and Gina Westbrook, director, Consumer Trends, Euromonitor, the world feels out of control as we move into 2019.

“There is much political upheaval in developed markets and fast, totally unprecedented change in developing economies. ‘Taking back control’ has been the catchphrase for major political movements as people want more agency and self-determination​,” the authors predict.

“Many of our 2019 Global Consumer Trends are about taking back control and asserting ourselves. In the face of turmoil and uncertainty, we feel more powerful when we can go back to basics and eat an egg laid by our own hen, or actively choose to find solace away from digital demands without junking them completely​.

“We want to get that thing or service seamlessly and easily. We want to make a difference to the world by buying more thoughtfully. We want to look after ourselves and sidestep the experts, by taking up the reins of knowledge ourselves and driving the consumer conversation more than ever.​”

For example, the desire for a plastic-free world is largely consumer-led and will gain further momentum in 2019 and beyond.

As the conversation moves on, understanding of plastics’ various uses in modern society will increase, and the emphasis will be placed on responsible use. Increased consumer understanding will also help to police so-called ‘greenwashing’, to expose false eco-friendly claims.

While plastic alternatives, such as seaweed water pods instead of plastic water bottles, will continue to be developed, the wave of corporate pledges on recycling / recyclability is also a positive step.

“Plastic has never been such a talking point of consumer concern and is set to be an even bigger consumer focus in 2019​,” said Rosemarie Downey, industry, manager, packaging, Euromonitor International.

“The durability of plastic packaging, noted among its strengths, is being scrutinised because of plastic’s polluting presence. Notable NGO and legislative initiatives targeting plastic have pushed plastic high up the public agenda​.

“Some retailers are making plastic-free commitments and brands are pledging to go further on re-use, recycled and recyclable packaging​.”

However, Downey added, it is important not overlook plastic’s valuable contributions. It’s used in medicine, construction and transportation. There are also inherent protective and resource-efficient benefits afforded by plastic in preventing food waste.

“Rather than a wholesale ‘plastic-free’ target, perhaps a ‘plastic waste-free’ world should be the goal​,” said Downey.

“By adopting a circular economy approach and harness the current spotlight on plastic as a way to progress development. Brands designing out surplus and ensuring plastic recovery and re-use, is a start.​

“Optimised waste management infrastructures and a greater consumer understanding of plastic handling post-use is also necessary.​” ​

Age Agnostics don’t hold with conforming to demographic expectations - everyone connects. The key to winning and retaining loyalty and trust is to develop products and services that are universally accessible even while designed with older people in mind. Baby boomers have more in common with the values and priorities of millennials and younger generations than many realise, and it is this inclusive mindset that needs to be better understood and catered for in the future. Universal and welcoming, it is about taking care of oneself and focusing on prevention and enjoyment of life. Balancing mental, spiritual and physical is the priority here.

Back to Basics for Status consumers are searching for authentic, differentiated products and experiences which allow them to express their individuality. Consumers in developed economies are re-evaluating their spending habits, moving away from overt materialism to simplicity, authenticity and individuality. As emerging economies develop further, the same pattern is likely to emerge, with consumers tiring of generic products and starting to place more value on higher quality, unique and differentiated offerings, which convey a certain level of status.

Today’s Conscious Consumer is flexible and chooses for the moment. What used to be the domain of ethically-positioned niche producers is now being embraced by conventional companies through higher welfare alternatives of existing products. Conscious Consumers are influential, and the trend will spread to others. Animal welfare concerns will evolve further and extend to other industries beyond food, beauty and fashion, to home care, home furnishings, pet food and so on. The meaning of responsible business is shifting, demanding companies improve minimum animal welfare standards even for regular products.

The growing ubiquity of high-speed internet, particularly the acceleration of mobile internet, is driving live interactive experiences online and facilitating collaboration on large files instantly. From dating to education, we have grown to expect more authentic, life-like interactions online. As our technological capabilities and comfort using them grow, so will the range of things we can do Digitally Together. Our growing comfort with sharing our friends, location and activities online will only lead to the development of new ways to engage. As our technological capabilities and comfort using them grows, so will the potential of what can be created or experienced together, remotely.

Everyone’s an Expert expresses the switch in power between retailer and consumer. Previously shoppers relied on a certain brand or information source to get what they wanted, now companies must constantly innovate, drive prices down and streamline and aestheticise their offerings to entice shoppers. At the root of the Everyone’s an Expert trend is the almost compulsive need for digital consumers to absorb and share information. As internet retailing continues to increase globally, all industries will have to adapt to consumers’ new demands to stay relevant.

The fear of missing out has now given place to the re-appropriation of self-time as people find joy in missing out. To protect their mental wellbeing, Finding My JOMO consumers want to be more intentional with their time, to set their own boundaries and be more selective in their activities. Globally, millennials feel the need for this re-empowerment more strongly than other generations. Planned disconnection provides them with time to reflect and to act freely, focusing on what they really want and enjoy doing. And in developing markets, reliance on the internet may be the origin of higher stress levels, especially when being connected is so linked to essential services.

The focus of I Can Look After Myself is the preventative, consumable measures against illness, unhappiness and discomfort that people can take without having to consult a professional. They make use of apps and personalisation services to create a product uniquely for them without the need to constantly engage with social media and brand marketing. Being able to ‘look after yourself’ is seen as a luxury that allows people to be more versatile and expand their possibilities. Dictating, designing and personalising your life allows you to be more flexible.

The push for a plastic-waste-free society has gained momentum over the past 12 months, and in 2019, I Want a Plastic-free World will grow further. The durability of plastic packaging is being scrutinised because of plastic’s polluting presence, post-consumer use, as waste in the global environment. Consumers will increasingly use their wallets to protest the irresponsible use of plastic, which could, in turn, create a virtuous circle where industry, from food and beverages to beauty and personal care manufacturers and beyond, stand to gain by improving sustainability

Efficiency-driven lifestyles transcend instant gratification. I Want it Now! consumers seek frictionless experiences that mesh with their lifestyles, allowing them to dedicate more time to their professional or social lives.

“Amidst slowing global growth rates, currency volatility and uncertainty in the commodity markets, we will need to adopt a cautious approach in cost management.”​

Amongst these cost management actions is a hike in the company’s products, which it confirmed would be raised by a maximum of 5% by April 1.

This was in response to increases in operational costs, which would include raw materials and packaging prices.

Heineken Malaysia owns and operates many of the major beer and beverage brands in the country, including Heineken, Tiger, Guinness, Kirin and Kilkenny.

That said, Heineken announced commendable results in its 2018 financial report, with revenue rising to RM2.03bn from RM1.87bn the previous year, a growth of 8.3%.

Net profit also increased 4.6% to hit RM283mn from RM270mn in 2017.

This was attributed to an ‘increase in sales volume, [previous] price adjustments on 15 April 2018, and the implementation of SST [last September]​’​.

“[We] remain focused on the sustainability of our business from barley to bar [and] continue to promote sustainable growth [via our people, brands and environmental conservation efforts],”​ said Bala.

Heineken was not the only beer company to have raised its product prices in Malaysia in recent months.

Last September also saw its main local competitor Carlsberg Malaysia raise prices by some 5.5%​, following the implementation of SST in the country.

“We expect the implementation of SST to impact consumer spending on beer negatively,” ​Carlsberg Malaysia managing director Lars Lehmann previously told us.

“[This is especially so] in on-trade which is exposed to double-taxation from both 10% sales tax on products at a manufacturer level and 6% service tax at the retail level such as restaurants and bars with annual revenue above RM 1.5 million.”​

“While off-trade sales are no longer subject to 6% GST, our customers may pass on their additional tax and business costs from the implementation of SST”​ ​

Contraband beer is a major issue within the Malaysian beer industry, and one that Heineken views as a ‘significant’​ problem.

“[The] illicit alcohol issue [causes] significant revenue loss to both Government and Industry,”​ added Bala.

“As members of the Alliance for Water Stewardship, we're dedicated to increasing water use efficiency across our own value chain, and helping people gain access to safe water, which is a fundamental human right​.”

She added PepsiCo now plans to increase its participation in and support of local water conservation work, focusing on high-water-risk geographies where action to protect this precious natural resource is urgent.

Around the world, 1 in 9 people struggle with access to safe and clean drinking water. Clean water shortages threaten the health and safety of communities, impacting hygiene and contributing to waterborne diseases, famine, migration and violence.

To address the issue, PepsiCo has set a number of goals to contribute to its Positive Water Impact, to enable long-term, sustainable water security for its business and others who depend on water availability.

As part of this effort, The PepsiCo Foundation, the philanthropic arm of PepsiCo, works with non-profit organizations to expand access in some of the world's most water-stressed areas.

The PepsiCo Foundation has led partnerships with Water.org to provide access to affordable financing for water and sanitation improvement projects in India, the Inter-American Development Bank to better manage changes in water availability in Latin America, and the China Women's Development Foundation to expand safe water access in rural areas of China.

The PepsiCo Foundation is also working with WaterAid in southern India to bring clean water to more than 200,000 people by restoring wells, harvesting rainwater in schools and building piped water supply systems.

In a project in Sri City, 21 tap stands were installed in Ananthapuram village, which will be converted into permanent structures to establish a sustained water supply and proper waste water drainage.

The PepsiCo Foundation and WaterAid plan to bring similar projects to other high-water-risk communities with the intention that increasing access to clean water will positively impact the health, security and employment opportunities of local residents, particularly women, who otherwise have to walk long distances to collect water.

PepsiCo is also working to conserve and protect fresh water as part of its Positive Water Impact strategy. Through a partnership with The Nature Conservancy (TNC), it is working with farmers, landowners, businesses, and communities throughout the US, Latin America and South Africa to implement efficient irrigation technology, protect upstream forests, and establish Water Funds to replenish at-risk watersheds.

In Latin America, PepsiCo and TNC are supporting watershed conservation projects that will enhance the supply and quality of water and improve the livelihoods of those in surrounding areas.

In 2018, the partnership replenished more than 76 million gallons of water to the watersheds in Guatemala City, São Paulo, Santo Domingo, Bogotá, Mexico City and Monterrey through conservation efforts across more than 990 acres.",PepsiCo on-track to support 25 million people with safe water access by 2025

IMA signed an agreement to buy 70% of Spreafico Automation in February.

The collaboration, led by Sara Lim, associate professor, Department of Food, Environmental and Nutritional Sciences (DeFENS), University of Milan, could lead to technological advancements in the portioned coffee market.

Spreafico has installed a custom-made machine, which it designed and built at its plant in Calolziocorte, Lecco, Italy, to assist the research team on the project.

Spreafico hopes to acquire knowledge in the field of self-protected capsules and their behavior according to type and different use conditions, which could be beneficial to small-medium roasters and larger manufacturers.

The project, which started last summer, takes into consideration self-protected capsules that do not need an exterior packaging but already have a barrier that ensures the product’s shelf life, ie those similar to Nespresso and A ModoMio.

According to data by IRi 2017, the capsule industry (both self-protected and standard) saw an 18.8% increase in value and 20% in volume, in the Italian market alone.

As part of the project, the research team will anlayse plastic materials used for making the capsule, the gas mixtures employed for the vacuum inside the capsule, the type and features of the packaging machines that are used and the quality of the ground coffee.

The preliminary phase of the study has included a comparative analysis of the different capsule types currently on the market, which have been examined by parameters such as the layers of the plastic structures, the evolution of the packaging gases to understand the sensory and qualitative changes of coffee.

The goal is to define how the interactions of all of these elements affect the quality of the finished product, to be aware of and create conditions for an optimal capsule packaging, which guarantees the fragrance of the coffee produced but also a shelf life that is as long as possible.

Understanding how to optimize not only the filling and packaging phases, but the composition and preparation of the capsule, could have a big impact on the industry, especially now that the sector is facing challenges driven by the environmental impact of these materials.

For example, a reduction in the thickness of the materials used or the ability of ensuring the correct atmosphere inside a complex system such as the capsule, could lead to a potential reduction in the environmental impact generated not only by the release of materials in the environment, but by the loss of product, an aspect which is often underestimated.

Objective evidence, on the contrary, shows, in the food industry, the loss of product caused by inadequate protective packaging plays a big role in the overall environmental impact of the sector.

Advantages of the study by Spreafico and Defens could lead to benefits for the whole production and distribution chain of coffee capsules.",Spreafico & Milan University to study the effects of coffee capsules on the environment

"New Zealand has set out to be a pioneer in the lower alcohol wine category, with consumers showing a growing appetite for such products. The challenge has always been to create wines that maintain the same quality as their traditional counterparts, but Stoneleigh believes its new launches have succeeded: “Quite often, experienced wine tasters don’t know it’s a lighter wine until we tell them.”",20-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/jamie-marfell-inspects-the-vines-ahead-of-harvest-at-stoneleigh-vineyard-p/9200389-1-eng-GB/Jamie-Marfell-inspects-the-vines-ahead-of-harvest-at-Stoneleigh-Vineyard-P_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/20/New-Zealand-winery-helps-drive-lower-alcohol-wine-category,"Consumers are increasing their focus on health and wellness, often seeking to substitute their traditional drinks for lower alcohol and lower calorie versions. While the trend has been more pronounced in the beer industry, New Zealand has set out to be a pioneer in lower alcohol wines.

Pernod Ricard's wine brand Stoneleigh has launched Stoneleigh Bright, a new wine range with an AVB of 9.5% - which is 25% less alcohol than its standard wines. The brand says it has succeeded in creating a lower ABV launch that still maintains the ‘distinct, vibrant style of the winery'.

Consumers around the world are increasing their focus on health and wellness, resulting in a decrease in alcohol intake. Data from Wine Intelligence suggests 50% of consumers are looking to reduce their alcohol intake, with 40% of these turning to lower alcohol options.

This trend is particularly apparent among millennials, who are much more health-conscious than previous generations.

While lower alcohol beers have been growing in popularity, lower alcohol wines remain a niche category​​ on a global scale, according to Wine Intelligence.

But it says the strongest opportunity for the category is in New Zealand, followed by Australia (out of 11 key wine markets analysed by the company last year). Wines that are naturally lower in alcohol are likely to have a better chance of success than those where alcohol is reduced via mechanical methods, it adds.

Based in the celebrated Marlborough wine region of New Zealand’s South Island, Stoneleigh is one of Pernod Ricard New Zealand Winemaker’s brands. It prides itself on the distinctive stone-studded Rapaura soils of its vineyards, ‘which create a wine style that is fresh, crisp and vibrant – the flavour of Stoneleigh’.

Across the wine industry, interest in lower-alcohol beverages has spurred efforts to ensure the taste is comparable to traditional counterparts.

“We are seeing many more high-quality, lower alcohol offerings on the market,” ​Jamie Marfell, chief winemaker, Stoneleigh told BeverageDaily. ​

“Historically, low alcohol was associated with lower quality and reduced flavour. But consumers are trying wines like Stoneleigh Bright and realising it tastes just as good but has the benefit of lower alcohol. The lower ABV is seen as an added feature, rather than a compromise.” ​ ​

In the case of Stoneleigh Bright, Marfell says the brand has been successful in addressing the taste challenge – “quite often when we them with experienced wine tasters, they don’t know it’s a lighter wine until we tell them,”​ he said.

“To make Stoneleigh Bright, we are using grapes that ripen earlier in the growing season. The earlier ripening does give them a slightly different flavour profile to grapes that ripen more slowly, but the variation is similar to what you get from grapes grown in different soils or different vineyards – it’s a really subtle difference. ​

“Stoneleigh Bright wines are still very clearly Marlborough wines, full of bright fruit flavours and crisp acidity, and they are crafted to give the same freshness of flavour and complexity.” ​

Stoneleigh Bright Marlborough Pinot Gris 2018​ has an ABV of 9.5% (compared to Stoneleigh Marlborough Pinot Gris 2018 at 13% ABV). The wine is “a pale gold colour and opens with aromas of pear and apple. There are tropical hints of pineapple and papaya. The fruit notes carry through to the palate, which is lively and fresh, then delivering a crisp finish.”​ The wine can be paired with equally fresh and light dishes such as Vietnamese summer rolls, or crisp chicken salad. A blush pink wine, Stoneleigh Bright Marlborough Rosé 2018​ is a blush pink wine with an ABV of 9.5% (compared to Stoneleigh Rosé 2018, ABV 13.5%). It “boasts bright aromas of red apples and yellow fleshed pear… the vibrant palate is bursting with raspberry and strawberry flavours, and it finishes fresh and light.”​ The wine pairs with salmon, or appetisers such as crab cake or sushi. Stoneleigh Bright is available in BWS stores across Australia, at a recommended retail price of $17.99 ($13 USD).

Stoneleigh Bright wines are made using grapes that ripen earlier with a lower brix (brix refers to the sugar level in grapes, which thus can determine the potential alcohol content of a wine).

“We’ve done a lot of research to understand the science behind winemaking, and that work has helped us to understand how our grapes develop their flavour throughout the growing season,” ​said Marfell. ​

“Once we understood that, it was relatively easy to identify blocks in our vineyards where the grapes develop their full flavour early in the ripening season when their sugar levels are low. ​

“The alcohol content in wine is directly related to the amount of sugar in the grapes that we use. For Stoneleigh Bright, we are picking grapes at 17 brix, compared with around 22 brix for our full-strength wines. ​

“That lower sugar level means that the wine is fermented with an alcohol content of less than 9.5%. We love this method because it means we can deliver wine that is full of all the flavours and vibrancy people expect from Stoneleigh, with the added advantage of being naturally lower in alcohol.”​","New Zealand winery helps carve out the lower alcohol wine category: ‘Lower ABV is a feature, not a compromise!’"

Heineken opened its first brewery​​ in the country this month, where Txilar - ""a beer specially made by Mozambicans for Mozambican consumers"" - is being produced.

Txilar uses local maize grown in the Catandica district, in the central province of Manica. It joins Heineken's portfolio of international brands such as Heineken, Amstel, Sagres and Strongbow in the country.

The English Drinks Company has launched Lemon Grove Gin at IFE in London this month: seeking to capitalise on the continuing gin boom.

The drink, pictured above, 'blends notes of juniper, nutmeg and Cassia bark fused with an unmistakeable burst of fresh lemon to create a refreshing alcoholic beverage, ideally suited to lighter summer drinking occasions'.

The gin can be served on its own over ice; partnered with tonic, or used in cocktails.

Revive Kombucha has launched a shelf-stable, organic, sparkling kombucha in the US.

Revive Sparkling Kombucha comes in four flavors: mango orange, cherry hibiscus, strawberry lemon and citrus ginger; and comes in 12oz cans. Each can contains 5g sugar, 20 calories and 5 billion live probiotics at the time of manufacture to support digestive and immune health.

The drink seeks to provide an alternative to sugary sodas, as well as hitting a ‘sweet spot’ between kombucha drinkers who want a lighter version and sparkling water drinkers who want the benefit of probiotics.

Revive Sparkling Kombucha uses a near-identical process to that for the raw and refrigerated bottled kombucha. The difference is the Sparkling Kombucha line undergoes a proprietary pasteurization process while incorporating a naturally fermented and live probiotic, DE111. “These very hardy bacteria protect themselves in varying conditions and only awaken when they hit the pH of your gut,”​ says the brand.

UK winery Chapel Down has launched Pinot Noir Gin: a gin “produced with distilled Pinot Noir grape skins from the Chapel Down harvest and blended with English wheat spirit to create a highly aromatic gin with delicate aromas of red berries, perfectly balanced with a ​

juniper led palate and citrus finish.”​

Chapel Down says the drink brings together winemaking expertise with modern distillation techniques.

The drink can be used in classic serves or in cocktails.

Packaged in a custom-made 70ml glass bottle designed to reflect both the wine and gin world: the bottom half of the bottle reflects a cut-glass crystal decanter while the frosted top half denotes the classic shape of a wine bottle.

Pinot Noir Gin is available in the UK from Chapel Down and Selfridges for £35.

Nestlé has launched a new range of tea capsules, jointly created by Kusmi Tea (tea brand) and Special.T (tea machine brand).

The range is available across Europe online, as well as in boutiques in France, Belgium, Austria, Luxembourg and Switzerland.

The capsules come in four of Kusmi Tea’s top blends: Anastasia (‘the historical Earl Grey that blends black tea leaves with bergamot, lemon and subtle orange blossom notes’); White Anastasia (‘the daring and delicate Anastasia blend with a white tea base’); Imperial Label (‘a delicate green tea flavoured with orange and cinnamon’)’ and Be Cool (‘an infusion of plants, liquorice and peppermint’).

Newly-formed start-up Nice has launched Pale Rosé and Sauvignon Blanc in a can in Sainsbury’s in the UK.

Nice sources its Pale Rosé from just outside Montpellier and their Sauvignon Blanc from Cotes de Gascogne, France. Both are dry, crisp, vegan,’ very swiggable’ and sourced from family-run vineyards.

The 250ml slimline cans are recyclable, and the wine is “perfect to drink on the train, move, beach, picnic or at a festival”​.​

“Being canned means that Nice chills at lightning speed, is endlessly recyclable, it’s light enough to take on any outings and if you’re just after one glass, there’s no need to pull the cork on an entire bottle,”​ says the brand.

Nice is led by two South London based entrepreneurs: Lucy Wright (ex Co-Founder of Cuckoo bircher muesli and Ananas Consulting) and Jeremy May (ex Propercorn and Vita Coco). The brand achieved £300,000 of investment from angel investors prior to launch.

Nice is rolling out across 600 Sainsbury’s stores, and will soon be available in Sourced Market, department stores, and summer festivals.

Simply Beverages, a US chilled juice and juice drink brand, has launched three new fruit smoothies: strawberry banana, mango pineapple and orchard berry.

The shake-and-sip varieties come in 32oz carafes and single-serve 11.5 oz bottles and contain between 130 and 140 calories per 8oz. serving. The smoothies are made with not-from-concentrate juices and purees, all-natural flavors, and are free from preservatives, colors, sweeteners or artificial flavors.

Coca-Cola says smoothies are a natural extension for the Simply portfolio, which already has more than 30 juices, juice drinks and ades. “The $5bn industry – which encompasses smoothie shops, DIY/make-at-home smoothies and RTD smoothies – continues to boom as Americans seek out convenient-yet-nutritious breakfast, snack and meal replacement options to enjoy at home or on the move,”​ says the company.

Ribena is moving into the enhanced and flavored water category with the launch of Ribena Frusion in the UK.

Lucozade Ribena Suntory has launched the drinks in 420ml and 1l formats. The 420ml bottles come in two flavours – Kiwi, and Blueberry – while the 1l bottles are available in Lemon Peel and Kiwi flavours.

The drinks are low in calories, rich in Vitamin C and free from sweeteners or preservatives. The 420ml bottles are made from 100% recycled plastic.

Blanche de Gramont, Senior Brand Manager at Ribena LRS, said: “We are absolutely thrilled to be able to launch Ribena Frusion, a refreshing and unique blackcurrant water infused with real fruit and botanicals to give consumers a feel-good choice when it comes to hydration that tastes great.”​

"Superfoods are still hot in food and drink launches, and more consumers are concerned with incorporating proactive health and functional ingredients into their diets. A new report from Kerry Group found that 65% of Americans want more functionality out of their food and 25% are eating superfoods.",20-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/gettyimages-487439986/9273575-1-eng-GB/GettyImages-487439986_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/20/65-of-Americans-look-for-functional-benefits-in-food-and-drink-and-want-immediate-results,"Kerry debuted a new research report​ at Natural Products Expo West in Anaheim this month on proactive health in the diets of US consumers. It revealed that people are looking for powerful, versatile ingredients and taking their health more seriously.

Health-conscious adults said they are proactive with their health (69%) and want to ‘future-proof’ themselves from both short and long-term health concerns. Kerry surveyed them about this behavior “to more deeply understand consumer acceptance, knowledge and expectation from added functionality and functional ingredients.”​

It’s common for people to shift their health concerns throughout the course of their life, and the study reveals that while weight management is the overall most popular concern, as consumers approach 50 they also put a great emphasis on cardiovascular health. More Baby Boomers also believe that a healthy diet is important to maintain good health (95%), compared with millennials (88%).

But what millennials are interested in is what Kerry calls ‘experiential nutrition.’ They are looking for impactful benefits from what they put in their body, and they want them immediately. Stress, energy, sleep and digestion are all considered experiential categories of nutrition that are prioritized by health-conscious consumers.

“Despite sleep and mood being high priorities for consumers, many find the need to use ​medication rather than foods or supplements, signifying an opportunity for the food and beverage industry to find improved food and beverage solutions for these benefits,”​ the report said.

There are three main tools that consumers use to help them get their desired health benefits--dietary supplements, nutritional beverages and yogurt and other dairy products. Supplements and beverages are often closely related to each other, but dairy represents a unique category.

Michael Kemp, nutrition manager at Kerry, spoke to this publication at Expo West about the opportunities that the functional health trend is providing.

“I think dairy is really interesting because though the industry has declined over the last decade, it seems apparent to me that consumers still look to it as a potential superfood and as the go-to delivery platform to get the nutrition that they need,”​ he said.

This can be achieved through fluid dairy as well as other forms like yogurt, smoothies or cheese. Consumers link these foods with health benefits, along with other categories like vitamins and supplements, nutritional beverages, protein powders and granola bars.

Kerry believes there is a unique opportunity within declining products like breakfast cereals, smoothies and juice to “revive participation with added functionality.”​ Similarly, indulgent products like cookies, snacks, chocolate and RTD coffee and tea “have an opportunity to​

reinvent with added functionality.”​

Consumers are already showing that it’s a viable path for brands to explore, as 40% reported an interest in coffee that promotes brain health and 33% are interested in seeing probiotics in coffee.

Kerry analyzed 85 different ingredients in the study as they pertain to health benefits, and a few major standouts in both food and drink have superfood status. Kemp said there are five that cut across almost all health categories--green tea, apple cider vinegar (ACV), ginger, ginseng and turmeric.

According to Kerry, turmeric has increased on restaurant menus by 46% in the last year and grown in retail product revenue by 179% since 2016. It’s used for bone, joint, gut and brain health and its flavor has been a hit with protein drinks, smoothies, teas and other RTDs.

Botanicals, adaptogens and nootropics in general have experienced a sharp rise in popularity as ingredients. Ginseng is particularly big in China, and is well-known for assisting brain health, immune support and mood management. Green tea is considered one of the most versatile superfoods and is used for everything from anti-aging and blood sugar to gut and heart health.

ACV has experienced 86% growth vs four years ago and is good for lowering cholesterol, and managing blood sugar and weight. Ginger now appears on 55% of all US menus and support the immune system, digestion, bone health and energy.

Consumers are focusing on high-functioning ingredients, and Kerry determined a top 20 list for the best ones. The top ingredient perceived to deliver functional benefits is omega-3 fatty acids, like fish oil. Green tea, honey, coffee and probiotics round out the top five.

ACV, oats, garlic, grapefruit, dark chocolate, ginger, ginseng, melatonin, avocado oil, chamomile, spinach, ginkgo biloba, coconut oil, lavender and blueberries make up the rest of the list.

Top concerns and speed to market are key

As more unexpected products like sparkling beverages and chocolate enter the category, the functionality lines are blurring and the marketplace for these products is rising around the world. But Kemp thinks the US has a leg up on other places, with consumers more willing to try exotic ingredients for better benefits.

“Typically America leads the way and we act like velcro to the rest of the world. We pull them along whether they like it or not. Other parts of the world might not be there yet, but they will probably be very similar,”​ he said.

The Kerry report advises companies to consider products that aid in the top concerns in order to stay competitive--stress, energy, sleep and digestive health. Beauty and immunity management are also still young categories in the US market, and would offer differentiation.

“Beyond flavor exploration, limited release items and furthering nutrition, there is merit in offering additional functionality where consumers are pleasantly surprised and have relatively lower barriers to trial. Speed to market will be crucial to stay in the game and ahead of the game,”​ Kerry said.",65% of Americans look for functional benefits in food and drink and want immediate results
Australian functional beverage brand Swirlit is eyeing overseas expansion with a product marketed as a nutritious alternative to sugary drinks that also boasts oral health benefits.,22-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/nutraingredients-asia.com/article/2019/03/22/drink-to-dental-heath-aussie-functional-beverage-brand-targeting-further-apac-growth-with-prebiotic-product/9263445-3-eng-GB/Drink-to-dental-heath-Aussie-functional-beverage-brand-targeting-further-APAC-growth-with-prebiotic-product_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/22/Drink-to-dental-heath-Aussie-functional-beverage-brand-targeting-further-APAC-growth-with-prebiotic-product,"A tea-based beverage that also contains prebiotics, Swirlit has the 'added benefit' of being able to replace the caustic mouthwashes people often use.

In addition, it contains xylitol instead of sugar, as well as a proprietary blend of vitamins and minerals.

Founder Angie Lang, a qualified dental surgeon, came up with the concept of Swirlit after noticing a prevalent problem among her patients.

Speaking to NutraIngredients-Asia​, she said: ""A lot of the problems I saw every day in my dental practice were caused by sugary drinks, so I wanted to develop something that was just as enjoyable but wouldn't cause such problems. Ultimately, I wanted a drink I would recommend to my patients.""​

She added that it wasn't just the high sugar content of soft drinks that damaged teeth, but the acidity in such drinks as well — in fact, she found that even sparkling water was acidic enough to dissolve tooth enamel if consumed regularly.

""In 2007, I started doing some research into the ingredients and the kinds of properties such a drink would have — it took a while to find the relevant evidence and organise all the research, as well as to find a factory that could make this drink, because it's a bit of a unique process.​

""It needed to be pH-neutral, as that would make it a better-for-you product from a dental perspective; I'd seen a lot of damage caused by acidic drinks and wanted to create a healthier alternative.""​

The oral and dental health aspect was important to Lang also because of the negative effects of mouthwash she had observed — its ingredients, she said, could be detrimental to dental health if mouthwash were to be used for more than seven consecutive days.

Furthermore, traditional mouthwash often relies on alcohol and strong anti-bacterial agents to give users a fresh, minty mouthfeel.

Swirlit, on the other hand, contains only food-grade ingredients.

Lang said, ""It's a drink intended as a substitute for sugary and acidic drinks, and the oral health functionality is a bonus.​

“It gives you fresh breath and makes your mouth feel clean and hydrated without feeling like you've had to use any strong alcoholic or anti-bacterial ingredients, though it's not intended to be a mouthwash.​

""These days, there are prebiotic and probiotic drinks like kombucha, which is great for gut health. Essentially, Swirlit is to oral health what those other drinks are to gut health. There are prebiotics in Swirlit as well, and all the vitamins and minerals in there are designed to support good oral health.""​

She further said that for the most part, Swirlit's ingredients — which are fully fair trade and non-GMO — are sourced within Australia, with the tea coming from India and some of the vitamins in its proprietary blend coming from the US.

After nearly a decade of research, Lang was finally ready to begin production of Swirlit in 2016. She sold her house and dental practice to do so, and after about two years, the drink debuted in the Australian market.

Lang is waiting to hear back from one of the country's large grocery store chains, and is in discussions with hotel groups, airlines, pharmacy groups and vending machine operators to carry Swirlit.

In terms of overseas expansion, she plans to make the brand available on Amazon in the US ""very shortly""​, with South Korea as Swirlit's primary APAC target.

Lang said: ""South Korea is actually the overseas market we'll be moving into first, as we have a big group over there that wants to take us on. We've been working on developing that market for 18 months through large-format pharmacies similar to Walgreens.​

""Singapore is definitely one of the countries we want to get into, especially since there's a big expat market over there. We're also developing our markets in Hong Kong, the UK and US, but we don't have a retail presence in those countries yet.""​

Lang also plans to launch new flavours of Swirlit this year: at the moment, only the green tea and cinnamon flavour is available, but white tea and rose, rooibos, and black tea with blueberry will launch soon.

Besides new flavours, the company is also considering different formats.

For example, it says the 2017 European PET beverage bottle collection rate stood at an average of 58%. In volume terms, EU member states would need to collect twice as many bottles, by weight, in 2029 when compared to 2017.

""Germany and Norway have already reached the 90% collection rate target. However, in stark contrast, 2017 collection rates in Bulgaria and Greece stood at 17% and 29%, respectively​,” said Isabelle Gilks, analyst, Wood Mackenzie.

“There will be considerable challenges in meeting the 90% target in Central and Eastern Europe – notably Poland, Bulgaria and Romania, where we forecast PET demand to grow by over 50% in the period up to 2029​.

“To recycle this additional volume in collected waste, more than 60 new reprocessing plants – with an average annual capacity of 30kt each – would be required. Without considerable investment in infrastructure and waste management collection, the target is unlikely to be met​.

“If, however, EU member states do manage to reach the target, a larger volume of plastic waste will either be incinerated or sent to landfill​.”

Included in the EU's directive is the target to incorporate 25% of recycled plastic from 2025, increasing to 30% from 2030, in all PET beverage bottles.

""We forecast this will lead to a six-fold increase in demand for recycled PET in Europe by 2030. Given the current levels of investment in new PET recycling facilities, this is an extremely ambitious target​,” added Gilks.

""However, it's worth noting the EU's target for recycled plastic in all PET beverage bottles is more modest than targets announced by industry, with a number of big brands targeting 50% use of recycled PET in their beverage bottles by 2030.​

""We expect there to be a strong demand for recycled PET leading up to 2030 and beyond, which may displace some virgin PET demand. We are also likely to see the price of recycle flake rise substantially as demand increases, however supply could well be constrained.​

“Despite the ambitious nature of these targets, it is likely we will continue to see further product bans or additional charges on single-use item usage, as this has been an effective method in causing demand destruction​.

“This is evidenced through the implementation of the UK’s plastic bag charge, which led to more than an 80% reduction in demand​,” added Gilks.",EU PET bottle collection target ‘too ambitious’

UAE mineral water market leader Agthia has stepped up its sustainability efforts with the announcement of new long-term goals and partnerships targeted at reducing negative impacts on the environment.,27-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-asia.com/article/2019/03/27/careful-and-considerate-uae-mineral-water-giant-agthia-intensifies-group-sustainability-initiatives/9223108-1-eng-GB/Careful-and-considerate-UAE-mineral-water-giant-Agthia-intensifies-group-sustainability-initiatives_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/27/Careful-and-considerate-UAE-mineral-water-giant-Agthia-intensifies-group-sustainability-initiatives,"The company announced that it aims for all of its packaging to be 100% eco-friendly by 2020, as well as to achieve zero landfill waste by this date. At present, 100% of Agthia’s secondary packaging used in all of its product categories is already recyclable, and 99% of this is biodegradeable.

It has also committed that for all of the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) it uses, by 2021 10% will be sourced from recyclable sources, and 5% from plant-based sources.

“Agthia as a company bases ourselves on innovation and ensuring food security, and as such many of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts are a blend of both of these components,” ​Agthia Group CEO Tariq Ahmed Al Wahedi told FoodNavigator-Asia.​

“[We have] from the onset adopted a careful and considered approach, integrating best environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) practices in our business and avoiding any harm to the environment and all others who may be effected, directly or indirectly by our manufacturing activities in all locations.”​

As part of its efforts to incorporate innovation into its CSR efforts, Agthia has also partnered with packaging company DGrade, which specialises in eco-manufacturing. DGrade uses recycled plastic bottles to make eco-friendly products such as clothing and bags, effectively leading to a closed-loop supply chain.

As part of this collaboration, DGrade will collect plastic bottles from Agthia and process these into textiles, which Agthia will then donate to charity.

""[Agthia has] been working silently for years to ensure [we are] not only bringing innovation and value to our customers and shareholders, but also looking out for the environment’s best interest,” ​added Al Wahedi.

“We [are] committed to further enhancing sustainability throughout the Agthia group, across all our operations, geographies and touchpoints.”​

The Agthia-DGrade collaboration is a significant one, as Agthia leads the region in terms of mineral water and as such is bound to produce large numbers of plastic bottles.

Plastic bottles are one of the biggest contributors to plastic worldwide, with over one million plastic bottles bought per minute globally​, a number expected to reach half a trillion by 2021. Multiple large corporations such as Nestle and Unilever have previously been called out over their plastic waste management​.

According to the DGrade website, their process is quite straightforward: The plastic bottles are collected, washed, flaked and sorted, then melted using heat to produce fibres that can be made into yarn.

“This yarn can be woven or knitted in the same way as conventional fabric, thus helping to create a sustainable system for recycling waste back into everyday products, such as clothing, toys etc.,”​ said DGrade.

Some of its current bigger name clients include Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Mars.

According to Agthia’s financial report for the year ended December 31 2018, the company made total revenues of some AED2bn (US$544mn), and this was led by its Water division at AED 800mn (US$218mn).

The company’s flagship product, Al Ain water, remained a firm market leader with 28% market share, and in combination with the other Agthia water brands Al Bayan and Alpin, the company’s market share stood at 30%.

The Sidel Aseptic Combi Predis utilises dry preform and cap decontamination for 100%-sterile filling and capping of PET bottles during sensitive beverage production.

The plant also produces end-to-end packaging from bottle design to end-of-line; Combis for carbonated soft drinks (CSD), water and hot-filled products, conveyors, packers and palletising equipment.

“Our Beijing site was the largest industrial investment ever made by Sidel, the only factory we have that is able to manufacture a variety of packaging equipment​,” said Sam Strömerstén, president/CEO, Sidel.

“With up to 4,000 installations in the country, the professional technical trainings offered in our 1,200m² Technical Training Centre and our continuous focus on quality, based on a LEAN manufacturing approach and driving our industrial footprint globally, are clear proofs of our commitment to the Chinese market​.”

The 40,000m² plant, is housed in Beijing’s Economic and Technological Development Area.

The aseptic laboratory includes a testing room, cleaning and sterilisation room, and is used for validation tests of Beijing-made aseptic and ultra clean equipment.

With 56 sets of advanced equipment, the team can run preform and cap decontamination tests, hydrogen peroxide residual tests within the packaging, microorganism isolation and purification.

Scarlet Chen, VP, Beverages Equipment Sales & Services Greater China, Sidel, said the Bejing team works with packaging scientists based in Shanghai to give advice on pre and post execution phases.

“This is particularly important regarding aseptic applications, which are increasingly gaining the favour of our customer base,​” she added.

According to Euromonitor, liquid dairy and plant-based drinks are on the rise among consumers in the region, and they are increasingly bottled in PET to offer a premium proposition, this figure is expected to grow.

Over the past 10 years, Sidel has implemented more than 100 aseptic PET complete lines in Greater China.

Some of Sidel’s customers in the region include: Yili, Huanleja, Nanjing Ziquan and NongFu Spring.

In 2017, Sidel designed PET bottles for Yili’s range of yoghurt drinks​ for China. The Sidel packaging team worked with Yili's Liquid Milk Division to create the PET bottle for the company's Changyi brand.

Huanlejia recently started producing its coconut milk​ – formerly packaged in HDPE – in PET bottles to reinforce its brand image and increase production speed.

The coconut milk PET bottle is produced on two Sidel complete aseptic PET packaging lines, running at 48,000 bottles per hour (bph).

Nanjing Ziquan has installed a second Sidel hot fill PET line to meet growing demand for Mizone​, a functional drink popular in China. The line is running at a speed of 36,000 bottles per hour (bph) and follows positive feedback on a similar complete hot fill PET line installed in 2013. It brings the total number of hot fill lines installed in the Nanjing plant to three.

When Nongfu Spring decided to switch from HDPE to PET for its 4 litre bottles it turned to Sidel to supply a Combi water line for 4 litre PET bottles running at 14,000 bottles per hour (bph).

The PET bottle is fully transparent and light, requiring less material to produce and creating less waste compared to a HDPE bottle which lacks clarity and needs more material to manufacture. The PET bottling line also offers lower total cost of ownership through its capacity for higher production output than a HDPE line.",Sidel celebrates on-going success in China with 10th anniversary
"De-cocainized coca leaf extract makes diet cola sodas taste better, according to a patent, and the scientist behind it is promising ""a revolution in soda beverages that benefits the people of South America, not anonymous multinationals"".",28-Mar-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/coca-cola-classic-getty-fotoatelie/9306443-1-eng-GB/coca-cola-classic-getty-fotoatelie_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/03/28/This-is-a-whole-new-flavor-chemistry-Coca-leaf-extract-improves-the-taste-of-diet-cola,"Published this month​​, the patent describes a method for improving the taste of a diet cola beverage product by adding a de-cocoainized coca leaf plant extract.

It was filed by Gregory Aharonian, president and chief scientist at KukaXoco, a coca leaf R&D company.

According to the patent, the liquid or powder extract is effective when combined with a diet cola beverage at a ratio by weight of approximately 22:1 to 44:1. It can also improve the taste of diet cola syrups.

“Drinking the resulting beverage ends with a more pleasant taste and/or aroma as opposed to the taste and/or aroma that occurs solely with existing diet colas,” ​it reads.

After testing samples of the extract in Diet Coke in plastic bottles for 60, 90 and 120 days, there was little or no noticeable difference in taste, aroma or coloring; no clouding or sedimentation; and acidity levels “barely changed​”.

The scientist analyzed the properties of the drinks pre- and post-coca extract using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

The is also cost-effective; if bought in large quantities, the extract is equivalent to around three or four cents (US$) per beverage.

'A whole new flavor chemistry for food & beverages'

Aharonian believes the coca extract is a game-changer for the food industry.

""First, it works,"" ​he told FoodNavigator-LATAM. ""Second, [...] coca leaf extract contains new aromatic chemicals rarely used in the food and beverage industry. This suggests a whole new flavor chemistry for food and beverages. ​

""The chemicals in the coca leaf are not sweeteners, but rather undiscovered aromatic chemicals that make some foods and beverages more pleasant to consume – without adding sweetener.​ And just think of all of the other possible plant extracts in Latin America that might have similar beneficial uses.""​

In the patent, Aharonian slams PepsiCo and Coca-Cola’s R&D scientists for trying to replicate the taste of sugar by focusing only on replacement sweeteners. They have “failed to understand​” the importance of flavoring additives, he writes.

However, the beverage giants are well aware of what is at stake in the trillion-dollar global soda industry.

In 2017, Coca-Cola announced a US$1 million public prize​​ to the person or group who found a new natural sweetener for its cola drinks.

Over the years, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have developed low-sugar or zero-calorie versions of their beverages, such as Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero, Coca-Cola Life, Diet Pepsi, and PepsiMax. These low-sugar versions are sweetened with sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame, sucralose, saccharin, and stevia, among others.

According to Aharonian, food industry scientists' ""failure​"" to make low-sugar products taste as good as the full-sugar equivalents has had a hugely negative impact on public health.

""[Coca-Cola and PepsiCo] need to quickly embrace any new technology that allows them to make better tasting, healthier products - such as KukaXoco’s technology,""​ he added.

KukaXoco plans to license the technology to cola soda and chocolate manufacturers. (The technology also debitters cocoa allowing for less sugar to be used in chocolate). ​

""Once we have license agreements with such companies, we will work with their food scientists to experiment with coca leaf extracts and chemicals in the leaves, to make even better tasting versions of chocolate and sodas, than the prototypes we now demonstrate,"" ​Aharonian explained.

'We would love to work with companies such as Postobon in Colombia, AJE Group in Peru, and AmBev in Brazil to launch a joint revolution in soda beverages that most benefits the people of South America, not anonymous multinationals."" ​

This new version is lower in sugar, and has received a ‘Healthier Choice’ label.

“This variation of Lipton Ice Green Tea Honey Lemon [has been exclusively] developed for the Thai market, [and is designed] for consumers to ‘cool off’ during summertime,” ​a PepsiCo spokeswoman told FoodNavigator-Asia.​

“[We are offering this Lipton Ice Green Tea Honey Lemon variant] as a Better For You option, ​a healthier choice with less than six grams of sugar per 100ml,”​ she said.

This was in line with the Thai government’s introduction of a sugar tax into the country across six years​ (from 2017), which will apply to sugar-sweetened drinks containing more than six grams of sugar per 100ml.

“The tea kits [we use for this product] are imported from Ireland, but [production is conducted] locally at the SPBT plant in Rayong province, [in accordance with strict] Lipton standards,”​ she added.

“It is a [combination] of well‐sourced green tea leaves and natural honey, with a slight and exciting note of lemon.”​

Lipton Ice Green Tea Honey Lemon is now available at all 7-Eleven stores nationwide in Thailand, at THB20 (US$0.63) per 445ml bottle.

Apart from this variant, SPBT also produces two other types of Lipton Ice Tea in Thailand: Lipton Ice Black Tea Lemon and Lipton Ice Black Tea Peach.

This release came close on the heels of another SPBT launch in Thailand, the goodmood water range​.

“‘goodmood’ is not a functional drink, it’s a ‘water plus’ beverage,”​ Omer Malik, SPBT CEO told us previously​.

“Water is good for daily hydration but [lacks] taste enjoyment, while sweetened drinks are tasty but high in sugar, so we [saw] an unmet demand there, [and decided] to offer a new choice to consumers: ‘Water Plus’.​ ​

“It’s [essentially water plus] a refreshing taste, so is a [guilt-free], healthier choice with sugar [content of] less than 6 grams per 100ml.”​

The ‘Water Plus’ category was established by Suntory in Japan in 2014 using a blend of its ‘expertise in innovations, continuous investment on brand development and strong market executions’​. The range includes plain water, natural tasting water and sparkling water.

Thailand’s sugar tax introduction in 2017 has led to a natural decrease in demand for sugar in the local market.

Drink manufacturers used just some 440,000 tons of sugar in 2017 as compared to 540,000 tons in 2016, and snack producers used just 29,000 tons in 2017 as compared to 36,000 tons the year before, according to numbers from the Thai Office of Cane and Sugar Board.

According to the United States Food and Agriculture Organisation, Thailand is one of the world’s largest sugar producers, and the third in Asia behind India and China.

As of March 2019, tax rates in Thailand for sugar-sweetened drinks such as Lipton Ice Green Tea Honey Lemon stand at an excise rate of 14% (of retail price) plus additional sugar taxing according to content, as per data from the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service.

“Pepsi Japan Cola is designed with a carefully balanced combination of spices, a subtle flavor of salt, and citrus flavors unique to Japan,”​ Suntory spokeswoman Naoko Kushima told FoodNavigator-Asia​.

“The end result is a taste that [brings] both a robust mouth feel and a sharp and clean aftertaste, delivering an exceptionally refreshing experience that is popular with Japan's ‘cola lovers’.”​

“[Suntory aims to] further revitalise the cola market in Japan.”​

Kushima added that the development of this product was the latest in a line of ‘unique marketing activities’​ undertaken by the company to attract Japanese consumers since Suntory Beverage & Food acquired the master franchise right to the Pepsi Cola brand in Japan back in December 1997.

“[Pepsi Japan Cola was developed] based on product development knowledge from both PepsiCo and Suntory,”​ she said.

The cola will be available in two variants: Regular sugar and zero calories. The sugar content in the regular version will be ‘almost the same’​ as that in regular Pepsi Cola.

Pepsi Japan Cola will be launched on April 9 this year all throughout Japan, at JPY140 (US$1.27) for a 490ml bottle. Information on other packaging and sizes will be made available on the launch day.

“It will be available through the all sales channels such as supermarkets and convenience stores and vending machines, and online,”​ Kushima added.

A fact worthy of note is that this new product is not the same as the Pepsi J-Cola range​, which was also released by Suntory exclusively in Japan last year.

Pepsi J-Cola fell under Suntory’s ‘Japan and Joy Cola’ concept, which the company said was to be ‘​positioned as a new, strategic brand for the Japanese market’​.

Instead of Japan Cola’s salt and yuzu flavours, J-Cola contained a ‘carefully balanced combination of spices and citrus’​ and was the product of a survey conducted on 100 cola-loving customers. It has been described as a ‘deeper Pepsi with a refreshing aftertaste’​.

J-Cola was launched not only with a zero-calorie version, but also a Midnight edition.

“[The J-Cola Midnight] focuses on the fact that around half of Japan’s cola lovers drink cola in the evenings and night, [and was developed to be] suitable for the night scene,” ​said Suntory.

The Midnight version retains the ‘robust mouth feel of the regular product’ ​but contains an ‘additional drifting hint of cassis’, ​based on what half of all surveyed Japanese customers said they most wanted from a drink late at night.",Japan-only cola: Suntory launches exclusive Pepsi Japan Cola to ‘revitalise’ local market

“Fit4style hot protein beverage is as easy and familiar to make — and enjoy — as a cup of coffee.”​

The mixture - which comes in salted caramel, vanilla, and coffee flavours - is currently available in Israel but the firm is looking for partners in Europe, US and Asia Pacific.

This is the second product line under the Fit4Style sports nutrition brand.

Fit4style Energy Spray​​, a mint-flavoured, six-calorie on-the-go energy kick entered the market in February this year.

The spray is said to work by coating the mouth in carbohydrates, therefore tricking the mind into believing the body has been fuelled with carbohydrates, causing a burst of energy.

Matok V’Kal says the spray can boost stamina for up to 75 minutes during high-endurance workouts and sports activities, without caffeine or other stimulants.

It was attracted to Magic Rock as ‘one of the pioneers in the UK craft beer scene with a loyal following due to its relentless pursuit of authenticity and quality’.

Based in Yorkshire, Magic Rock sells its beer in pubs and supermarkets in the UK as well as exporting to 25 countries. It says that, with the support of Lion, there is an opportunity to grow further outside of the UK.

Magic Rock: 'The best way to build on our legacy is to introduce our beer to a wider audience'

Magic Rock was founded by Richard Burhouse and head brewer Stuart Ross in 2011. In 2012 it was voted the second best new brewery in the world by RateBeer.com and has since been voted five times as a top 100 world brewer on the site.

It employs 45 people out of its Hudderfield base, and plans to expand its team in line with its growth strategy.

The brewery produces around 15,500hl pa (2.7 million pints) and opened a new facility in 2015 with a 4,000 sq ft Tap Room and automated canning facility. Its core range includes Dancing Bier, Hat-Trick and Common Grounds.

Co-founder and managing director Richard Burhouse will remain actively involved in the company after the acquisition.

“The best way for us to build on our legacy over the long term is to introduce Magic Rock beers to a much wider audience,”​ he said.

“We’re excited to be joining one of the world’s best brewing experts under the shared promise to keep making great beer, on a bigger scale, through their knowledge, expertise and investment.”​

The UK craft market represents a 6% share of UK beer volume and 5% share of global craft beer volumes. Lion is already an active player across the UK and Europe: selling a range of Australian and New Zealand craft beers, including Little Creatures and Panhead, alongside New Zealand fine wines.

Matt Tapper, managing director, Lion Global Markets, said: “Lion has a long and proud history in craft beer in Australia and New Zealand and we see some great opportunities to help put Magic Rock into the hands of more beer lovers.​

“Lion is continuing to take a patient, long-term approach to capital investment in international markets to meet the demand for diverse craft beer experiences. The UK continues to be one of the most exciting places in the world to experience craft - and given its cultural similarities to Australia and New Zealand, now is a great time to partner with Magic Rock to invest in building their premium brands and to expand Lion’s presence in that market.”​

As part of Lion Group (a subsidiary of Kirin Holdings), Lion is behind beer brands such as XXXX, James Boag and Tooheys. Its portfolio also includes craft brands such as James Squire and Malt Shovel, Little Creatures, Kosciuszko and Furphy.

Lion’s Global Markets (LGM) business was launched in 2015 to take its Australian and New Zealand craft beers and ciders into new international markets, as well as accelerating growth of its North American wine business. Lion says the business is able to 'operate in an entrepreneurial way with a lean, fast, and flexible operating model'.

""With significant growth in craft beer forecast for the coming years, Lion has identified the UK as an opportunity to leverage its craft experience and brands from Australia and New Zealand to drive long term growth outside of its home markets,"" ​says the company.

Lion has made several other acquisitions over recent weeks: including its entry into the craft spirits sector with a 50% stake in Australia’s Four Pillars Gin;​​ the acquisition of New Zealand drinks brand Teza Iced Teas by Lion NZ; and the acquisition of American wineries Markham Vineyards and Textbook via its US-based wine business Distinguished Vineyards & Wine Partners.",Lion acquires Magic Rock Brewing

It identifies low and no alcohol brews and cans as two of the most significant trends in the market.

‘Low alcohol beer is here to stay’​

No and low ABV beers are increasing in popularity as consumers seek to moderate their alcohol intake. Big brewers​​ and craft brands alike have been increasing their work in this area.

In the UK, no and low alcohol beers (classified in this report as 2.8% ABV or below) have seen growth of 381% in the last two years, with a number of brewers now choosing to specialize in low alcohol brews, says EeBriaTrade’s report. ​

“One of the big recent trends is the growth of low and no-alcohol beers,""​ says the report. ""While commonplace in many European countries such as Spain (where 33% of consumers drink non-alcoholic beers) and Germany (23%), it is much lower in the UK.​

“This has started to change quite quickly: in 2019 nearly 3% of beers bought have been 2.8% of below, and of those 1.5% have been 0-0.5%. While the 2019 numbers include Dry January in three months of statistics, the picture doesn’t change dramatically when January is completely excluded. Low alcohol beer is certainly here to stay and we expect this trend to continue quickly, as there is still a long way to go.​

“With some breweries now specializing in low alcohol, such as Big Drop, Infinite Session and Small Beer, as well as established breweries adding low alcohol beers to their range, like Thornbridge’s Big Easy, it seems like this is an area of craft that will continue to expand.”​

‘Canned craft certainly seems to be the future’​

The craft beer industry has seen a shift towards cans, says EeBriaTrade. In the UK in 2016, cans were used by 16% of packaged craft beer. This has now risen to 72% over the last 12 months.

The 440ml can format is the most popular size.

“While bottles were historically by far the favoured container for beers, cans have very rapidly taken over with over 70% over craft beers sold over the last year in can.​

“Until early 2017 almost all cans were 330ml, but that has very quickly changed with the majority of cans sold in the previous year being in 440ml cans. This was mainly triggered by highly regarded Manchester brewery Cloudwater’s decision to stop using 330ml bottles, and to move to 440ml cans, making them one of the first in the UK using this size. It didn’t take long for many others to follow suit.​

“We don’t see any evidence to believe that these trends won’t continue, with increasing numbers of producers moving their packaging over to cans, and many to the larger 440ml. Having analysed the rate of sales of producers, we discovered that 83% of producers that switched from bottles to cans saw an uplift in rate of sales, which on average was almost 3x. Canned craft certainly seems to be the future.” ​

EeBriaTrade has released the first part of its research here;​ with a second part to come in April. It is currently crowdfunding on investment platform Seedrs as it seeks to expand into eight new countries this year.",Craft beer trends: ‘Huge growth’ in lower alcohol brews and beer in cans

Hard seltzer sales rose by 169% in 2018 and volume sales were up by 181%, according to Nielsen data.

It does best in off-premise retail sales and is most popular in the warm summer months. Hard seltzer still has a lot of room to grow on-presence, struggling to interest bars and restaurants that already have a full menu of beer, cider and spirits.

Many brands have largely interchangeable flavors in their portfolios (such as lime, mango, berry)., while packaging in the category is predominantly slim white cans.

So when it came time for White Claw to add on to its existing flavors--Black Cherry, Natural Lime, Ruby Grapefruit, Raspberry and Mango--it wanted to fulfill “the unmet consumer need for a convenient and refreshing alternative to vodka and soda.”​

White Claw Pure is designed to be a new option for vodka soda drinkers, as 55% of vodka consumption is mixed with soda, tonic or water. Devoid of any flavor, Pure is designed to incorporate into other drinks and be customized by each individual drinker.

Sanjiv Gajiwala, senior VP of marketing at White Claw Seltzer Works, said ""While many other hard seltzer brands continue to release more complicated flavors, we know consumers love the clean, refreshing taste of White Claw and identified an opportunity to launch a hard seltzer in its simplest form with White Claw Pure Hard Seltzer.""​

White Claw says its drinks “encourage active living by eliminating the need to transport ingredients necessary to craft preferred drinks.”​ The alcohol in White Claw comes from fermented sugars, and cane sugar and natural flavors are added to its original flavors after alcohol fermentation.

Japanese beverage firm Kirin has announced the plan of using 50% recycled plastic in PET materials for its domestic businesses by 2027.,02-Apr-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-asia.com/article/2019/03/12/cutting-plastic-waste-kirin-to-use-50-recycled-plastic-in-pet-materials-by-2027/9238230-1-eng-GB/Cutting-plastic-waste-Kirin-to-use-50-recycled-plastic-in-PET-materials-by-2027_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/04/02/Cutting-plastic-waste-Kirin-to-use-50-recycled-plastic-in-PET-materials-by-2027,"The firm is aiming to cut plastic waste by promoting the recycling of PET bottles; eliminating single-use plastic and replacing it with other materials; andimproving the sustainability of PET bottles.

To promote recycling, the firm will work with national, local government, and industry organisations to create an efficient collection and reuse system for high-quality used PET bottles.

“​We​ do not believe that Kirin alone can achieve the goal. We believe that it is necessary for all stakeholders, including peer companies in the same industry, distributors, plastic recyclers, and even the administration to be united in building a system to achieve the goal,” ​company spokesman Toshiaki Hyoudou told FoodNavigator-Asia​.

Elaborating on the collaboration between different players, he said that the National Food Drink Federation had agreed to make recycling boxes available at places with vending machines to collect used beverage containers.

To encourage sorted collection, the recycling boxes for collecting used PET bottles are also labelled as “exclusively for PET bottles”.

The firm last year also endorsed the Soft Drink Business Plastic Resource Reclamation Declaration issued by the Japan Soft Drink Association last November. This is an initiative aimed at the 100% effective utilisation of PET bottles for zero waste by 2030.

In 2017, only 3% of Kirin’s PET materials used recycled plastic and some products use 100% recycled resin PET bottles.

According to The Council for PET Bottle Recycling, the recycling rate of PET bottles​ in Japan is highest in the world.

In year 2017, out of the 587,000 tonnes of PET bottles sold, Japan achieved a PET bottle recycling rate of 84.8%, which was 0.9% higher than the previous year.

Elsewhere in Europe, the recycling rate was 41.8%, while that of the US was 20.9%.

Besides increasing PET bottle recycling, Kirin also plans to create PET bottles with more sustainable means, such as considering the use of non-edible plants.

Toshiaki said that doing so would help to reduce the dependence on petroleum resources.

This approach has been already been adopted by some food firms.

"Though several research projects have already studied the impact on wine flavours of smoke from bushfires and controlled burns, there has been little analysis of the lasting impact of stubble fires from nearby grain fields.",05-Apr-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/stubble-burning-getty-isidho/9328807-1-eng-GB/stubble-burning-getty-isidho_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/04/05/Grape-and-grain-but-never-the-twain-when-stubble-fires-contaminate-vineyards,"To address this, the Australian Wine Research Institute and the University of Adelaide have embarked on a new smoke taint project in South Australia that will study how grain smoke affects grapes during harvest.

The research involves a series of field and winemaking studies in the coming months to discover the sensitivity of grapes to smoke from low intensity crop stubble burns. It will also seek to determine the exact point when smoke loses its potency to wine grapes.

“A lot of the state’s economy is driven by agriculture, and the biggest two industries are wine and grain. Obviously these come in contact with each other, and the burning of stubble in close proximity to grapes happens quite a bit. That can lead to some tensions​,” Mark Krstic, AWRI’s business development manager, told BeverageDaily.

South Australian wine producing regions, including the Barossa and Clare valleys, are adjacent to vast swathes of grain-growing belts, which traditionally conduct their burn-offs during autumn—close to grape-picking time.

Stubble burning is a long accepted agricultural practice to wipe out weeds, seeds and snails after harvest and before sowing.

South Australia’s primary industries and regional development minister Tim Whetstone said although stubble burning was not as prevalent as it once was, it remained an important tool in the grain production cycle ahead of the planting of winter crops.

“The grains and wine sectors are two primary industry super powers in South Australia and it is important they are each able to co-exist without detriment to the other​,” he said.

However, for both agricultural practices taking place in such close proximity, South Australia is in dire need of devising a way for them to coexist with minimal damage done to grapes and wine production.

“What we are hoping to do is understand the risks that stubble burning very close to the grape vines has on tainting grapes to really grasp the risks to the grape growers​,” said Dr Krstic.

“What I think will happen out of that is we will modify the guidelines around how grain growers are allowed to operate. This might mean only burning stubble at certain times of the day, probably 10-4, when we know the conditions are right​.”

Most of the time during a burn smoke will float straight up directly into the atmosphere. Settling happens, however, mostly in the evening, when the smoke stays suspended in layers close to the ground where the vines are.

The research will help better forecasting around these “inversion layers​”, and it is hoped this will prompt clear new guidelines to regulate when grain growers can burn.

“From our previous research on smoke taint, we know there are certain factors at play like smoke drift distance, type of smoke, time of day for burning, seasonal conditions and wind speed​,” he said.

“We hope to be able to refine this through further research and give both the wine and grains industries enough information to make sound decisions when they are considering the needs of their own business, as well as their neighbours​.”

As well as researching the affect of smoke on grapes, AWRI advises other wine producing regions, including California, several in Europe and South African wine country, and also conducts remedial work following wildfires.

It is currently working in Tasmania in the wake of bushfires which started there in mid-January.

“There’s been a couple of quite large fires in Tasmania, that’s resulted in there being smoke around some of the wine producing areas there​,” Dr Krsic said.

“We are still at an early stage and working with the industry there, receiving samples and analysing them to see what levels of potential taint might be there​.”

On this kind of mission, AWRI teams will assess the levels of smoke-taint compounds in affected grapes. They also advise growers about certain measures they can take to reduce the extraction of those compounds when they are at low levels. These can include keeping the fruit cool and not pressing grapes so hard that they squeeze out the chemicals into the juice.

The team is still at an early stage of its work in Tasmania, mostly receiving samples and analysing them to see what levels of potential taint might be there. If the levels are high, there will be decisions to make over whether the grapes will be picked or not.

“If they are too tainted they’ll be left on the vine and not harvested and turned into wine. In terms of overall impact I’m not aware of what it is at this time​,” Dr Krstic added.

South Australia produces about half of Australia’s wine each year, prompting the state government to provide A$60,000 (US$42,300) in funding to support the stubble burning research.

Having huge grain fields so close to vineyards threatens to become a fraught issue in years when the dates for grape picking and stubble burning converge. Fortunately, this year, it is not an issue, with a sufficient gap between the two practices. But some years it can come to a head.

“We know it can be a problem, but we know there’s a solution too: that is just by getting the two industries talking more closely and understanding each other’​s production pressures​,” said Dr Krstic.

""Just by getting two groups that might appear to be in conflict talking together, there’s always a good middle-ground to be found​.”",Grape and grain but never the twain when stubble fires contaminate vineyards
Chinese firm Jiangsu Howbetter Food has launched a new plant-based beverage prototype made from nine different nuts and is keen to introduce its expertise to the West.,05-Apr-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-asia.com/article/2019/04/05/nine-nuts-beverage-chinese-firm-howbetter-seeks-entry-in-western-s-plant-based-drinks-markets/9289492-4-eng-GB/Nine-nuts-beverage-Chinese-firm-Howbetter-seeks-entry-in-Western-s-plant-based-drinks-markets_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/04/05/Nine-nuts-beverage-Chinese-firm-Howbetter-seeks-entry-in-Western-s-plant-based-drinks-markets,"The firm specialises in food texture and premix technology for dairy, beverage, bakery, ice-cream.

Made with peanut, walnut, almond, hazelnut, pine nut, cashew nut, pecan, Australian macadamia nuts, and Hawaiian macadamia nuts, the firm showcased the prototype of its nine nuts plant protein beverage during the recent Food Ingredients China exhibition.

Speaking to FoodNavigator-Asia ​during the exhibition, general manager Spring Li said it took the team about half a year to develop the product, including selecting the types of nuts, considering the roasting process, harmonising the flavours and texture, and ensuring the stability of the product.

Into its 21st​ year of operation, the firm now has ambition to introduce its expertise in plant-based beverage to the West. Currently, the domestic market is its biggest market at 70%, while South East Asia and South Africa make up the bulk of its export markets.

On its entry into the US, Li said that the firm was already in talks with an American dealer to bring its stabiliser for plant-based protein beverages into the country.

“China should be considered the best when it comes to producing plant-based protein beverages given our long history and expertise in this area. In China, it is common to see plant-based beverages made from soybean, walnut, and almond,”​ Li said.

“The US market may be the familiar with nuts products, however, it is mainly on the original nuts products and not so much on other types of applications. That is why we thought we could bring our expertise in this area to the West since there is so much interest in plant-based products now.”​

On the firm’s nine nuts plant-based protein beverage, she stressed that no fragrances were added, and the flavours and nutritional input purely came from the blend of nuts.

Working with end-product manufacturers, the firm hopes to target this particular product at the vegan consumers, male consumers who prefer plant-based beverage for protein intake instead of milk, and consumers in their 20s, since they are more interested in novel flavours.

Besides booming interest in plant-based protein beverages, taste, function, and natural continue to triumph in the Chinese market, according to Li’s observation.

The firm is therefore on a mission to develop functional ingredients to alleviate common ailments.

“30% of the Chinese population has stomach or digestive problems and there is the issue of excessive exposure to blue light from computer and mobile screen. As such, there is scope for us to include functional ingredients beneficial to health in dairy products,”​ Li said.

She gave the example of adding fermented soybean protein powder into milk to aid in digestive health, a concept which the firm came out with last year. In this case, there is the need to add stabiliser since the protein powder is insoluble in water.

As for eye health, she said blueberries or lutein could be added into milk to make it a functional product.

“In fact, milk is a very good medium for adding functional ingredients since consumers already know that it is a good source of nutrition, our job is to ensure that the functional ingredients can harmonise well with the texture and quality of milk,”​ she added.

On the other hand, she revealed that consumers’ interest in health and natural ingredients such as oats was booming, with sales growing by nearly ten-fold in the past two years.

She explained that oats were highly popular for the high dietary fibre and protein contents, which made them good candidates for diet replacement meals, ready-to-eat meals, energy bar, and yogurt toppings.

Adding to its expertise on nut-based products, the firm has applied for a patent for its technology in preventing the oxidation of nuts and thus, prolonging its shelf life.

Li explained that the technology involve the making of a protective layer over the nuts, with this, the nuts would be separated from air and could help extend the shelf life by twice the amount of the original shelf life period. At the same time, no man-made additives is added.

Tony Weisman, chief marketing officer at Dunkin’, said ""​We saw so much excitement and passion for our partnership last fall, and we're thrilled to delight our fans who start their day with Dunkin' coffee and end it by enjoying one of Harpoon's famous craft beers once more with the introduction of new Summer Coffee Pale Ale.""​

The new beer will be available through the summer while supplies last, in 12oz cans and on draft at select locations. It has an ABV of 5%.

Dan Kenary, co-founder and CEO at Harpoon, said ""We ended last year's baseball season with the intro of Harpoon Dunkin' Coffee Porter, and we're excited to begin this season with the release of our Summer Coffee Pale Ale. Most importantly, it's a delicious beer – hoppy and vibrant with a nice coffee character. We're thrilled to partner with an icon like Dunkin' again.""​

Dunkin’ has also expanded its line of Signature Lattes with three new flavors. It marks a further investment in its espresso drinks, which it called “one of the most transformative product initiatives in recent brand history.”​

The drinks are made at participating Dunkin’ locations with “new state-of-the-art espresso equipment for optimal espresso bean extraction and a new recipe for a stronger and more robust flavor profile,”​ an effort to elevate Dunkin’s reputation from the budget coffee option compared to the more expensive Starbucks.

The new flavors include a Blueberry Crisp Latte (blueberry and caramel flavors, with whipped cream, caramel drizzle and cinnamon sugar topping), a Caramel Craze Latte (caramel flavor, with whipped cream, caramel drizzle and cinnamon sugar topping) and a Cocoa Mocha Latte (mocha flavor, with whipped cream, mocha drizzle and hot chocolate powder).

All three lattes will be available hot or iced nationwide. Dunkin’ describes its lattes as the creamiest option in its espresso selections, made with two-thirds steamed milk, poured over a shot of espresso and topped with a layer of milk foam. The Signature Lattes feature the extra flavors and toppings.

“We believe that everyone deserves a delicious espresso whether it is a classic drink or a more elaborate creation. Our new espresso experience has established Dunkin’ as the place where even the most discerning espresso enthusiast can enjoy high-quality lattes, cappuccinos and more, served fast and at a great value any time of day,”​ Weisman said.",Dunkin’ releases second beer innovation with Harpoon Brewery
The Brewers Association (BA) released its annual growth report this week: showing craft brewery volumes have increased by 4% and now account for 13.2% of the US beer market.,05-Apr-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/ba-2018-infographic-april-2019/9335261-1-eng-GB/BA-2018-infographic-april-2019_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/04/05/US-craft-beer-market-has-settled-into-a-more-mature-growth-pattern,"The 4% growth comes against a backdrop of a 1% decline in the overall beer market; but the BA warns that the days of 'meteoric growth' experienced in the past are over.

Brewers need to adjust their business models accordingly: and plan their strategies around a much more competitive market, says the trade body for US craft beer.

In value terms, the craft beer category enjoyed 7% growth to $27.6bn: taking a 24.1% market share.

Craft beer production has increased considerably in the US in recent years. In 2014 there were 3,814 operating craft breweries across the country, and in 2018 there were 7,346. But the industry is not without its challenges: while 1,049 breweries opened last year there were 219 breweries that shut their doors.

Bart Watson, chief economist for BA, said that the outlook is mixed for craft beer, a category facing competition from other alcoholic drinks and pressure from consumers turning their back on alcohol completely. But production did increase to 25.9m barrels of beer, up from 25.1m in 2017.

“It’s much harder to give a single message, good or bad, than it has been in some previous years,"" ​he said.

""Certainly a category that adds a million barrels in gross share, even as overall beer saw volume losses in 2018, that’s a positive sign. But it’s certainly a slower growth market, even for a growing category like craft, and a more competitive market than we’ve seen in the past.​

“The growth level isn’t what it has been, and that’s going to pose challenges for breweries that built their business model around large chunks of growth and particular segments in the market.”​

More than 150,00 people were employed in small brewing jobs last year, an 11% increase over 2017. But the BA has made ‘slight tweaks’ to its methodology last year in communication with brewers, allowing for a more accurate jobs estimate.

The BA report broke down craft beer’s growth by category, revealing that microbreweries contributed 80% of the total growth, up from 60% in 2017. Brewpubs were up 13%, accounting for about 20% of total growth. At-the-brewery sales are still well below retail, at just 3.1m barrels out of the 25.9m produced.

Any category growth last year was driven heavily by the newest breweries, and those in their second and third years. Markets that are seeing a steady increase continue to be out west, particularly concentrated in California. But New York, Texas and Florida are also showing brewery strength.

“Craft has settled into a more mature growth pattern and is unlikely to return to the meteoric growth levels seen over the past decade,”​ Watson said.

Of the 219 breweries shuttered in 2018, 123 were microbreweries, 90 were brewpubs, five were regional and one was classified as ‘large.’ Despite this, Watson says that the smallest brewers are the most successful. In a crowded and specialized market like craft beer, it’s hard to resonate outside of a brand’s home market.

Even still, it can be a struggle for a brewery to ‘make it’ in certain parts of the country. Densely populated and beer-saturated states like California, Oregon and Colorado are above average. It’s unlikely for states like Florida to reach their level, even with steady growth.

To reach more consumers, many breweries choose to expand their draft list beyond beer. It’s common now for small and large craft operations alike to experiment with other alcoholic drinks, including hard cider, hard seltzer and even wine and spirits.

“We’re seeing brewers in a competitive marketplace look for ways to make their brands resonate with beer lovers and drinkers more broadly,” ​Watson said.

“Particularly in regions where growth is a challenge, brewers are looking to experiment and grow any way possible.”​

Many craft breweries produce more than beer, but all the dollar amounts and volume growth in the BA report come solely from beer performance. In December, the BA updated its definition of a craft brewer​, no longer requiring the majority of what a brewer sells to be beer.

The BA says this will support the innovation of craft brewers who are evolving and shifting the craft brewing practice, allowing more freedom to generate revenue in alternative ways.",US craft beer has settled into a 'more mature growth pattern'

The brands include Clos du Bois, Black Box, Estancia, Mark West, Wild Horse, Franciscan, and Ravenswood.

Constellation says the divestiture will allow it to concentrate on its more premium wine and spirits brands.

Bill Newlands, president and CEO, Constellation Brands, said: “This decision will help enhance organizational focus on a more premium set of wine and spirits brands that better position our company to drive accelerated growth and shareholder value. ​

“In turn, Gallo is acquiring a collection of great brands that complement their operational model and business strategy to provide quality products to consumers at every price point.”​

Constellation’s remaining wine and spirits portfolio includes Robert Mondavi; The Prisoner Wine Company; Kim Crawford; Ruffino; Meiomi; and SVEDKA Vodka. It also has high-end brands such as SIMI, Schrader Cellars and Mount Veeder Winery wine brands; High West Whiskey and Casa Noble Tequila; and Cooper & Thief and Spoken Barrel. Its beer portfolio includes Corona and Modelo.

Gallo says the acquisitions will allow it to offer products at all price points. Joseph E. Gallo, chief executive officer, said: “While we continue to invest in our premium and luxury businesses, we see a tremendous opportunity with this acquisition to bring new consumers into the wine category.​

“We will continue to provide our customers and consumers with quality products at every price point.”​

“Achieving ASI certification across Europe takes us in another step towards our target to source 100% of our key materials from certified sources​,” said Ian Wood, chief supply chain officer, SIG.

SIG claims to be the first in the industry to achieve certification to the ASI Performance Standard Material Stewardship Principle at corporate level, together with the ASI Chain of Custody certification for its production site in Austria.

The company has now extended ASI Chain of Custody certification to all its carton sleeve production sites in Europe.

The ASI certification enables companies to audit the aluminium supply chain against strict standards on a broad range of ethical, environmental and social topics.

Previously, there was no such certification available to certify the ultra-thin layer of aluminium foil used in SIG packs.

SIG’s ASI Chain of Custody certification has made it possible for the ASI Standard to be put into practice for the first time in aseptic carton packs.

Dr. Fiona Solomon, CEO, ASI, said SIG’s milestone in achieving duel ASI Certification sends a strong signal that responsible aluminium sourcing is an important strategy for the packaging sector.

“The option of on-pack labelling will also offer the opportunity to get the message on responsible aluminium out to consumers​,” she added.",SIG gains milestone on dual ASI certification for aseptic foil cartons
Constellation Brands is expanding its core Corona brand with new launches that appeal to a wider range of consumers and occasions – including the nationwide US rollout this month of premium alcohol-spiked refresher Corona Refresca.,08-Apr-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/news/manufacturers/constellation-brands-2019-sees-a-monumental-shift-for-corona/9342249-2-eng-GB/Constellation-Brands-2019-sees-a-monumental-shift-for-Corona_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/04/08/Constellation-Brands-2019-sees-a-monumental-shift-for-Corona,"Brand Corona has seen 7% growth over the last year, against a backdrop of stagnant volumes in the US beer market.

And while Corona Extra and Corona Light continue to be stalwarts for the brand, Constellation Brands believes its newer launches – Corona Premium, Corona Familiar and even flavoured malt beverage Corona Refresca – will drive growth moving forward by expanding occasions and enticing new drinkers.

After 7% growth for Corona over the past year, Constellation expects the brand to continue mid-single-digit growth.

The Corona portfolio is brewed in Mexico by Constellation Brands and imported and marketed in the US by the company. It has been the top imported beer in the US for more than 20 years and the number five beer brand overall.

But its success to date has been primarily based on the classic Corona Extra and Corona Light brands. The launches of Corona Premier and Familiar represented the first major Corona innovations in more than 25 years.

Constellation Brands says that fiscal 2019 has represented ‘a monumental shift for the Corona brand family as it expanded its offerings from Extra and Light into a more comprehensive beer family’.​ This has been driven by the launch of Premier and the expansion of Familiar, while this month it will roll out Corona Refresca across the US.

""The Corona brand family generated 7% depletion growth for fiscal 2019, selling over 150 million cases, which positions Corona as the number one brand family in the high end,""​ said Bill Newlands, Constellation Brands president and CEO. ""It is also expected to surpass Coors as the second largest brand family in the US retail in short order.""​

Corona has been experimenting with Corona Refresca - a premium alcohol-spiked refresher – over the past year in three test markets. This month, it is rolling out the beverage across the US, in the existing guava lime and passionfruit lime 6 packs, alongside a new variety 12 pack with a new coconut lime flavor.

Refresca has been designed to help bring in new drinkers, expand consumption occasions, and adds value, says Constellation.

""During fiscal 2020, we'll extend the Corona master brand to take advantage of consumer trends with the national launch of Corona Refresca,""​ said Newlands. ​

“Corona Refresca brings a completely new drinker to the Corona franchise and allows us to carve out a space within the large and growing FMB category that’s anchored in Corona’s carefree lifestyle.”​

‘We are seeing strong repeat purchases thanks to Corona Premier’s premium image’​

Corona Premier is ‘a smooth, perfectly balanced lager with only 90 calories and 2.6g carbs’​​, and was launched in the US in March 2018.

It targets men aged over 35 who want to trade up their beer choice, and differentiates itself from Extra and Light as a low carb and low calorie variety suitable for ‘the mature, sophisticated consumer’.

“Corona Premier was the number one new brand introduction in both volume and dollars last year and was larger than the number two and the number three product innovations combined,"" ​said Newlands. ""We are seeing strong repeat purchases with consumers motivated by the low-cal, low-carb benefits of Corona Premier’s premium image.”​

In its second year, Constellation will increase the marketing investment for Premier, in both English and Spanish. TV advertising will air from March to October with a focus on sports, including with the US Open golf tournament, which it is sponsoring through at least 2021.

Corona Premier will also launch additional packaging formats with 18 pack bottles to provide trade-up opportunities in larger format channels; as well as the national launch of Corona Premier Draft to boost on-premise sales.

Corona Familiar – a ‘full flavored lager that taps into the tradition of sharing with family and friends’​​ - was launched in Constellation Brands’ major US Hispanic markets in 12 oz bottles in 2017.

It has now become a top-10 high-end beer brand, says Constellation, and has recently launched 24 pack bottles regionally to capture larger social occasions. Over the coming year, the brand’s expansion will be supported with an increase in Spanish language TV as well as digital, social and in-store merchandising.",Constellation Brands: ‘2019 sees a monumental shift for Corona as it expands into a more comprehensive beer family’

BrewDog already has the BrewDog Berlin Mitte bar and is due to open another bar in Hamburg in June.

Stone Brewing: ‘Too bold and too early in our European growth curve’​

California-based Stone Brewing, which was founded in 1996 and is the ninth largest craft brewer​​ in the US, expanded to Berlin in 2014.

However, Greg Koch, co-founder and executive chairman of Stone Brewing Co, said that growth has been too much too fast for the brewery.

“Ultimately the project turned out to be too big, too bold and too early in our growth curve in Europe. ​

“Sure, in hindsight maybe we should have started smaller, aimed for the treeline instead of the stars. Today we lick a few wounds, but count our successes too. We are not leaving Germany. Or Europe. We’ve met a whole new country and continent of craft beer fans! Our distribution to more than 30 European countries will continue to grow. ​

“Stone Brewing Tap Room – Prenzlauer Berg is still very much open, and pints will still flow. We stand proud, and are heartened that we can pass the Mariendorf beer temple into the capable hands of our friends at BrewDog. They will do great things. And from time to time, as we’ve done in the past, we’ll do some of those great things together.”​

Stone Brewing beers will continue to be distributed around Europe.

BrewDog has launched a ‘Berlin Craft Collective’, where it will give independent Berlin craft brewers full access to the 10HL pilot system.

At its AGM on April 6, BrewDog launched the latest round of Equity for Punks, with a target to grow its community of shareholders to 200,000 and raise £7m / $9.1m (if achieved, this will bring its Equity for Punks total to £74m / $96.6m).

Equity for Punks will also help fund the development of the brewery in Berlin; and additional projects involving The BrewDog Distilling Company; opening a brewery in China; five new OutPost BrewPubs across France, Germany, Italy and Spain; and Europe’s first craft beer hotel called the DogHouse London.​​",BrewDog acquires Berlin brewery and taproom from Stone Brewing
"The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) implemented the mandatory attachment of warning labels to all alcoholic beverages on April 1, but has further extended the transition period for beverages manufactured before this date.",08-Apr-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-asia.com/headlines/policy/injurious-and-dangerous-alcohol-warning-labels-entered-into-force-in-india-from-april-1/9310439-1-eng-GB/Injurious-and-dangerous-Alcohol-warning-labels-entered-into-force-in-India-from-April-1_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/04/08/Injurious-and-dangerous-Alcohol-warning-labels-entered-into-force-in-India-from-April-1,"The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has implemented the mandatory attachment of warning labels to all alcoholic beverages from April 1.

The alcohol warning labels were announced last year on March 19, and all manufacturers were initially allowed a year’s grace period to make the required transitions.

Two compulsory warning messages must be included on the labels, which are ‘Consumption Of Alcohol Is Injurious To Health’ and ‘Be Safe – Don’t Drink and Drive’​.

Initially, the font size of the warning was fixed at 3mm for all alcoholic beverages, but this has been changed to 1.5mm for alcoholic beverages up to 200ml, and remained at 3mm for those above 200ml.

“[During the one-year transition period], various stakeholders brought up challenges in complying with [the original font requirements],”​ said Parveen Jargar, FSSAI Joint Director (Regulatory Compliance).

“The issue was discussed in the 13th​ meeting of Scientific Panel on Water and Beverages, [which after] detailed deliberations recommended [the new font sizes].”​

FSSAI added that the displayed warning could be printed in either English or the local/regional language. Where the latter is used, it is ‘not required to also print the warning in English’​.

These warning labels fall under the jurisdiction of the country’s Food Safety and Standards (Alcoholic Beverages Standards) Regulations 2018.

FSSAI also stated that the use of old unused labels and printed cans will be allowed for a further six months after April 1 2019, whereas alcoholic beverages manufactured prior to this date can still be sold in the market up to March 31 2020.

Other alcohol warning labelling regulations in the region​

India is not the first country in the Asia Pacific region to implement such labelling regulations with regard to alcohol.

In November last year, Australia passed a mandatory labelling standard for alcohol​ that targeted pregnant women, tasking FSANZ to develop what will effectively be a pregnancy warning label for alcohol.

The Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation stated that: “[Based] on the evidence, a mandatory labelling standard for pregnancy warning labels on packaged alcoholic beverages should be developed and should include a pictogram and relevant warning statement.​

​ “The Forum has requested that FSANZ develop this mandatory labelling standard as a priority and that the work be completed expeditiously.”​

Thailand also has strict alcohol advertising and labelling rules​ in place, and all alcoholic products are also required to include one of five permitted warning messages which relate to alcohol causing either physical health issues or socioeconomic damage.

According to Thailand’s Alcoholic Beverage Control Act: ‘No person shall advertise or display, directly or indirectly, name or trademark of alcoholic beverage in a manner that showing properties thereof or inducing other person to drink’​.

Taiwan also has such regulations, which require alcoholic beverage manufacturers to attach warnings such as ‘​Excessive consumption of alcohol is harmful to health’​ to alcoholic products.

According to the country’s Tobacco and Alcohol Management Division, these labels must be at least 2.65mm in font size, placed ‘conspicuously on the container’s largest external surface’​, and be on a contrasting background for ‘ready legibility’​.

Despite the implementation of the Food Safety and Standards (Alcoholic Beverages Standards) Regulations 2018 on April 1 regulating yeast content in alcohol-brewing, FSSAI has made a provision for craft breweries, allowing these to continue making beers with a higher yeast content.

Previously, the yeast content in regular beer or lager was set at zero, whereas draught beers were to have at most 40 CFU (colony-forming units).

Craft beers could contain as many as three million CFU, but were not separated from these previously, causing a stir in the industry.",‘Injurious and dangerous’: Alcohol warning labels entered into force in India from April 1

One customer in Spain increased sales by 16% through a scan and win campaign.

Ivan Nesterenko, VP, cross portfolio, Tetra Pak, said the project has been in development for around two to three years at its facility in Lund, Sweden, and it partnered with Microsoft Azure on its cloud service.

”Tetra Pak’s connected packaging platform will offer transparency and communication between producer and consumer​,” he said.

”The platform will allow consumers to; access digital product experiences via product packaging, learn more about the products you buy, where they come from and how they’re made, enable consumers to align their purchasing decisions with their personal values and priorities and have their voice heard​.

“Direct interaction with producers will allow people to play an active role in shaping the future direction of their favorite brands​.”

Nesterenko added the trial was limited to certain regions because ‘market and technological readiness is not equal in all markets’ and it was using a phased approach.

“We are very ambitions and hope this product will reach every continent. However, this is currently an aspiration and depends on differing markets supply chains and infrastructure - neither of which are currently robust enough to accommodate worldwide expansion,​” he said.

On expanding the connected platform to other products Nesterenko said: “Rather than being scaled for specific products the platform can be scaled across the entire supply chain, being applied to every step of the process, sharing information with retailers, producers as well as consumers​.

“The interaction will aid customization and a move towards the circular economy as data is collected, compared and analysed across the entire value chain of a product​.”

He added, driven by the trends behind Industry 4.0, and with code generation, digital printing and data management at its core, the connected packaging platform will bring a lot of benefits to food producers, retailers and shoppers.

“To design something of this massive undertaking requires a lot of capabilities – we have worked closely with Microsoft Azure to tackle development challenges,​” said Nesterenko.

Benefits of the connected platform include; end-to-end traceability to improve the production of the product, quality control and supply chain transparency.

Greater supply chain visibility and real-time insights, enabling distributors to track stock movements, be alerted when issues occur, and monitor for delivery performance.

And, the ability to access vast amounts of information such as where the product was made, the farm the ingredients came from and where the package can be recycled.

“We are unlocking new opportunities for our customers to get more value from packaging than even before​,” said Nesterenko.

“No longer is it only about product protection and functionality, it is about connectivity. The future of packaging is undoubtedly digital: this launch is a step towards a truly intelligent package, and we are excited to collaborate with our customers on this journey.​”",Tetra Pak transforms its milk and juice cartons into digital packaging

While each market shows individual characteristics, organic wine often attracts millennial consumers, those with a higher disposable income, and consumers who value natural products across the F&B category.

Europe will account for 78% of the global organic wine market by 2022, compared to the Americas which will represent approximately 12% of total organic wine consumption.

In Europe, the European Union defines wine as ‘organic’ if it has been produced from organic grapes or from oenological techniques and substances authorised for organic wine.

Germany is the world’s largest market for organic still wine: growing at a CAGR of 17.9% since 2012.

“Organic wine accounted for 6% of still wine consumption in the country in 2017, with locally produced German wine representing approximately 52% of that volume,""​ says IWSR. ""Organic wine in Germany is particularly purchased by women, consumers over age 50, and higher earners.”​

Another of the leaders in organic wine is France, where the category is expected to increase 13.3% to 17m cases against a decline in the overall wine market of 2.1% (CAGR 2017-2022).

Organic wine accounts for around 4% of the total wine category, with almost all of it coming from French producers.

“Distribution of organic wine in France is dominated by medium and large supermarkets, and increasingly is making inroads in the on-trade in by-the-glass pouring,""​ says IWSR. ""Althought Paris is the key driver of the country’s organic wine market, the trend is beginning to spread into other large metropoles and the French countryside.”​

In the UK, the value of organic is of particular note: consumers are willing to pay on average 38% more for a bottle of organic wine. The market also skews towards red wine (60% red versus 40% white/rose).

Here, organic wine is predicted to grow 9.4%, against the backdrop of declining overall wine consumption.

“​About 72% of organic wine in the UK is Old World, with France, Italy and Spain at the forefront,” ​says IWSR. “Organic wine speaks to a broad audience in the country, but primarily caters to wealthier wine lovers and/or regular buyers of organic produce, and those who reside in metropolitan areas - particularly London.”​

Organic wine resonates with millennials in the US​

In the US, organic wine is still a niche category: but it is growing and taking share from non-organic wines. Total wine volume in the US is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1% (2017-2022); but organic wines are expected to post 14.3% growth.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) mandates that before wine can be sold as ‘organic’, both the growing of the grapes and their conversion to wine must be certified.

“​More than 70% of organic wine sold in the US is produced in the country,” ​says the IWSR. “Organic wine buyers in the US tend to skew female, millennial, and higher income, especially those consumers in major markets who focus on healthy lifestyles and have a preference for natural food and beverage products.”​

In Japan, organic wine represents around 10% of the total still wine market – proportionally more than category leader Germany. It has already seen a strong average growth rate of 8.2% over the past five years, and although this is expected to slow in the coming years, the segment will still outperform the overall wine category.

The Japanese organic wine market is predominantly red wine (84.8%), and most wine is imported (with high volumes coming from France).",European markets drive demand for organic wine
"Heineken’s new zero-alcohol beer Heineken 0.0 is the brand’s pioneering foray into the Low and No Alcohol (LNA) category in Singapore, with the firm targeting availability in locations such as salad bars, gyms and offices as it seeks to rival soft drinks giants such as Coca-Cola.",08-Apr-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-asia.com/article/2019/04/08/zero-hero-heineken-wants-no-alcohol-beer-to-rival-coke-in-singapore-following-europe-sales-boom/9333132-1-eng-GB/Zero-hero-Heineken-wants-no-alcohol-beer-to-rival-Coke-in-Singapore-following-Europe-sales-boom_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/04/08/Zero-hero-Heineken-wants-no-alcohol-beer-to-rival-Coke-in-Singapore-following-Europe-sales-boom,"Heineken 0.0 is made with normal beer ingredients (water, malted barley, hop extract) and brewed with Heineken’s unique A-yeast, but the alcohol is removed ‘gently’​ in a ‘natural process’​.

“[Our] unique recipe [makes] for Heineken 0.0’s distinct balanced taste, and each 330ml bottle contains only 69 calories,”​ Andy Hewson, Managing Director of Asia Pacific Breweries Singapore (APBS) told FoodNavigator-Asia. ​APBS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Heineken Group, and and operates its local brewery in Singapore.

A 330ml bottle of Heineken Original contains some 138 calories, and a standard Coca-Cola around 140 calories, which means that Heineken 0.0 contains roughly half the calories of each of these.

Hewson added that Heineken 0.0 is driven by four key consumer trends: Health-consciousness, Increasingly busy lifestyles, a demand for high quality products, and a huge overlap between beer drinkers and consumers who drink soft drinks

“[Amongst] Singaporean beer drinkers aged 25 to 44 years old, an estimated 73% also drink non-alcoholic beverages),”​ he said.

The non-alcoholic beer was first introduced in Singapore last year as part of the Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Grand Prix, and later on market tested in Shell petrol stations nationwide. After receiving encouraging response from local consumers, it was officially launched in the country last month.

“In 2018, Heineken achieved its strongest volume growth globally in over a decade of 7% year-on-year, [and this was] fuelled by the success of Heineken 0.0,”​ said Hewson.

“The LNA category is booming in Europe and our ambition is to replicate this success in Singapore and in the region.”​

According to a Global Market Insights report, the global non-alcoholic beer market is projected to surpass US$25bn by 2024.

APBS has committed 20% of its total marketing budget into growing the LNA category in Singapore this year, with Heineken 0.0 as its flagship product for this.

“Our ambition is to grow the total Heineken brand in Singapore by 5% to 10% year-on-year in the next three to five years, strongly driven by Heineken 0.0,”​ said Hewson.

“In the long term, we expect the LNA category to outperform the success that the cider category has achieved in the past 5 years.”​

Apart from traditional trade channels where beer can be found such as supermarkets, bars and clubs, Heineken 0.0 is also expected to be found in less conventional locations like salad bars, gyms and offices.

“Basically, anywhere you can find a Coke, we want you to be able to find a Heineken® 0.0 as well,”​ Hewson added.

Within Asia, Singapore was selected by Heineken as the first market for launch due to what Hewson described as ‘massive opportunity for growth’​.

“Heineken is already a super strong brand in Singapore – we own nearly 50% of the premium beer segment locally,”​ he said.

“Amongst Singaporeans of legal drinking age and non-Muslims, a large portion doesn’t drink alcohol, [whereas some 73% of] beer drinkers also drink non-alcoholic beverages.​

“[There] is a significant overlap between both categories [and thus] a significant opportunity for us to tap into and grow [this] new segment. [So far], sales of Heineken 0.0 have been purely incremental with zero cannibalisation on Heineken Original [sales].”​

APBS will also invest SG$3.8mn (US$$2.8mn) into the installation of a de-alcoholiser in its brewery at Tuas, which is expected to materialise by Q3 this year, which will allow for local production of Heineken 0.0, which is currently still being brewed overseas.

“[This will] position Singapore as the supply hub for Heineken 0.0 and LNA beers in the region,”​ added Hewson.

In Thailand, the government is putting together a working group to examine the governance of beers within the LNA category​ being manufactured and produced by traditional beer breweries, such as Heineken 0.0.

Dr Nipon Chinanowet, Director of the Office of Alcohol Control Committee told The Nation​ that: “If it’s advertised as an alcohol-free malt beverage, there’s no problem, but if it’s advertised as an alcohol-free beer, we have to examine the intention and whether the advertising is breaking any law.”

​​Adding that the beer companies could be ‘taking advantage of a legal loophole’​, Dr Chinanowet said that at present these zero alcohol beverages were being registered as food items under the FDA, which allowed for far less restricted promotion as opposed to alcohol.",Zero hero?

In April 2018, Soylent rolled out to 450 Walmart stores​​ and five months later, the brand expanded to 1,850 Walmart stores. Since making the jump from its robust e-commerce business (where it was the #1 grocery product on Amazon in January 2017), Soylent’s meal replacement drinks will be available in more than 20,000 brick-and-mortar retail locations across the US ""with zero signs of slowing down,""​ the company said.

According to Walmart senior buyer, Todd Wetmore, Soylent RTD meal replacement drinks have ""become the center of the functional beverage set that Walmart is spearheading,"" ​which features ""up-and-coming brands of all sizes""​ that are launching in Walmart stores across the US.

""Soylent can be an aspiration for many emerging brands, as they show how this model can work successfully,”​ Wetmore added.

"Waterloo Sparkling Water debuted an expanded portfolio at Natural Products Expo West last month, launching Strawberry and Grape flavors. It’s the latest in the increasingly crowded sparkling water category, where brands are seeking to separate themselves from the pack.",09-Apr-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/waterloo-3/9322534-1-eng-GB/Waterloo-3_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/04/09/Waterloo-launches-new-flavors-leverages-classic-packaging,"Following the surge in popularity of brands like La Croix, it’s been difficult to escape the craze of flavored, sparkling waters. Apart from the category leader, brands like bubly (PepsiCo), Spindrift and Waterloo have built up large followings in the fizzy water game.

With the Strawberry and Grape launch, Waterloo now has 10 flavors, matching Spindrift (10) and catching up to bubly (12) and La Croix (21). Waterloo hopes the new flavors will be “a nod to Americana and beverage flavors that evoke childhood memories.”​

Sean Cusack, co-founder of Waterloo, said “People have come to trust that we will always deliver on taste with every single launch thanks to the genius of our in-house innovation team who is truly driven by their passion for artisanal sparkling water.”​

The Waterloo brand is less than two years old, but has already seen massive growth. They reported that by January 2019 more than 100 million Waterloo cans were sold in the US. But even with quick success, they acknowledge the tricky landscape of the flavored beverage industry.

Jason Shiver, CEO of Waterloo, told BeverageDaily “If you know something about the beverage category, you know it’s dominated by the major players in Pepsi, Coke and Nestle. Those guys are going to get their space, and it leaves very little space for people like us to try to participate.”​

Beyond taste and flavor profile, Waterloo tries to differentiate itself from other sparkling water brands with its packaging. The cans break from modern designs by using traditional fonts and colors with fruit illustrations and details.

“When you look at the branding on our product, it’s almost instantly classic, like a brand that you already know. That’s always a first step to someone picking up your product, you have to be interesting,”​ Shiver said.

Waterloo saw concerns that consumers had with other sparkling waters, wanting to know more about what comprises the ‘natural flavors’ added to most drinks. Waterloo, bubly and La Croix, for example, all use ‘natural flavors’ in their formulas. Spindrift opts for real fruit juice, emphasizing the difference on its website and packaging.

“Spindrift is all about what we put into our sparkling water – not what we remove. Spindrift is the first sparkling water made with only real squeezed fruit. So, when you pour Spindrift, you’ll see it is colorful because real fruit has color,”​ they said.

Waterloo is in the ‘natural flavors’ camp, but did decide to add ‘attributes’ like non-GMO and vegan certifications to “try to take that concern away from ​[consumers].”​ Shiver said they are the first sparkling water brand to his knowledge to achieve the certifications, noting that it wasn’t the cheap way to go, but “is a way for us to give consumers some sort of confidence in our product.”​

He said that for any beverage brand, flavor development is very transactional. When working with flavor house, they give you a vial of ingredients for each flavor. It’s a fruit essence that everyone uses, and mixing it with carbonated water usually gives a subtle fruit flavor.

Shiver said that Waterloo has taken it step further, piecing together a lot of different components for atypical interpretations of the flavors. He shared that the vision for the new Grape flavor was for it to be reminiscent of sugary grape soda enjoyed by kids. The team also spent four months testing hundreds of iterations before settling on the final Strawberry formula.

In the end, Shiver believes that it all comes down to taste, and that Waterloo has the superior product. The drive toward more health and wellness-focused products has been all about low calorie, low sugar and clean labels, but today’s consumers aren’t willing to compromise on taste.

“When you think about what happened with sparkling water, all these people made a life decision to move away from sugary soft drinks and juices. We believe that they felt like there was some sacrifice in the midst of all that. So we wanted to take that feeling of sacrifice away,”​ Shiver said.","Waterloo launches new flavors, leverages ‘classic’ packaging"

"Researchers in eastern Australia have started work on a three-month pilot plant to prove the economic viability of turning sugarcane waste into other compounds, including plastic drinks bottles.",10-Apr-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/sugarcane-getty-aerometrex/9329066-1-eng-GB/sugarcane-getty-aerometrex_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/04/10/Pilot-seeks-to-find-out-if-PEF-from-sugarcane-could-be-more-economical-than-PET-at-scale,"The programme is being run by Darryn Rackemann, a senior research fellow at Queensland University of Technology’s Centre for Tropical Crops and Biocommodities, and will be carried out at Gladstone, north of Brisbane.

It is being undertaken in partnership with Mercurius Australia using a process patented by the start-up’s US-based parent Mercurius Biorefining. This has the potential to convert the fibre left over after sugarcane is pressed, known as bagasse, and other types of biomass into cost-effective biofuels and bio-chemicals. These include PEF, a material which many experts have touted as being a successor to PET.

'The science has been proven: now we're trying to prove the economics'

The long-term aim of the project, which was funded by Queensland Government’s A$150m Jobs and Regional Growth Fund, is to produce quantities of biofuel and bioplastics sustainably at scale.

“The science has been proven​. The engineering now is trying to prove the economics. And once the economics are proven, we can roll out the technology further​,” Dr Rackemann told BeverageDaily.

“The main part of the pilot is to understand everything, looking at the yields of the chemical products as well as the recovery of the catalyst and solvents in the system. Everything we have done before it is on a laboratory scale. The economics require us to know how much we would lose in the process when we move up to a large scale​.”

Up to now, the process has only produced grams of chemical and fuel samples. The pilot will ramp this up to processing a few hundred kilos of biomass per day. It involves converting a chemical, chloromethyl fulfural (CMF), into polyethylene furanoate, or PFT, a more sustainable plastic than PET.

The plastics stage of the pilot will follow an assessment of the process’s efficiency in making biofuels from sugarcane bagasse. This is done by converting the CMF to make a longer carbon chain.

“At first, we are only looking to produce the CMF, not necessarily the plastic. We’re doing the pilot to show we can get large quantities of this chemical. There’s a number of companies that are really interested in sourcing that​,” said Rackemann.

“The main part of the pilot is to understand everything, looking at the yields of the chemical products as well as the recovery of the catalyst and solvents in the system. Everything before has been on a laboratory scale, so the economics require you to know how much of the chemicals we would lose in the process when we get to a large scale​.”

Queensland has a substantial sugarcane industry, harvesting about 35m tonnes each year and producing several millions of tonnes of potential bagasse.

John Clark, director of Ant Packaging in northern New South Wales, a plastic bottle supplier, said the market was satisfied with PET but was always looking out for novel materials that are even more practical and sustainable than the global standard.

“PET is environmentally at its peak at the moment​,” he told BeverageDaily. “I’ve heard about PEF as a drop-in replacement and we’d welcome that. ​

""For now, though, the best solution, environmentally at least, is to use recycled PET because it closes the loop effectively: it solves the resource problem at the start and the waste problem at the end​.”

Though the plastic bottle industry enjoys a good reputation in Australia, the environment is its “Achilles heel​”, he added. This is a knock-on from occasional cases of nefarious recycling practices and prompt many bottle-makers to go as far as they can to bolster their green credentials.

PEF is lighter and stronger than PET. “It also has better barrier properties for oxygen and other gases. That’s why many people think it would be a good replacement PET bottles and packaging​,” said Dr Rackemann.

He says it is not fully known yet whether PEF breaks down as well as PET, and more research needs to be done in this area before it’s possible to say it’s both sustainable from this bioderived source and also biodegradable.

“It’s not something we’ve developed ourselves—there’s been many groups developing it over the years. They’ve looked at similar chemicals that could in the end be used as bioplastics, and we’ll be further developing it and seeing if we can make it economically viable when we get to a larger scale​.”

While the initial focus of the pilot plant is investigating the conversion of biomass into fuel, biofuels are expected to take second stage to the bioplastics in terms of money-spinning production. It’s likely that, even though biofuels are always going to be important as a goal, it may be that there’s more money in plastics.

Once the economics have been assessed following the pilot, the researchers and their commercial partners will set out to woo investors to take production to demonstration scale.

“At this point we may be processing around 10-20 tonnes per day of biomass, so we can further show that the technology is scalable and can improve on current​ economics​,” said Dr Rackemann.

“It’s not really mind-blowing when you go into a lab and see something happening in a test tube. But when you can see the pilot scale and the end-product coming out the other end, that’s when people get a lot more excited, and hopefully investors will also get excited too.”​",Could PEF from sugarcane be more economical than PET at scale?

To celebrate the launch the company has released two more infusions including: Lemon’s End and Thirsty, Orange Ya?.

The Boozin’ Bags will also be available in a variety of holiday and lifestyle themes.

“Next generation consumers expect socially responsible options from brands, and they expect those options to be available for delivery right to their door,​” said Patrick Shorb, president, Holla Spirits.

He added, another advantage which benefits the brand is PLCB (Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board) is now allowing Pennsylvania limited distilleries to ship spirits directly to consumers within its state borders.

As a result, Holla now delivers all its direct-to-consumer orders in the lightweight eco-bags, which it packages and ships in custom-decorated boxes. The company no longer sells glass-bottled spirits on its website.

Shorb said the packaging is environmentally friendly because they have a low carbon footprint (80% less than 750ml glass bottles, less shipping costs because the material is lighter weight than glass bottles and reduced waste because it is recyclable and demands less landfill space than glass bottles.

All Holla vodka direct-to-consumer orders are shipped and an adult signature is required upon delivery. The packaging labels also feature child warnings.

"Just as a temple or village hall in southern China will always greet you with a door guardian, so does the entrance to Moonzen brewery in Hong Kong. Indeed, the carvings inspired the craft beer brand’s name and its appearance.",28-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/rich-w-3/9514637-1-eng-GB/Rich-W-3_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/28/Beer-of-the-gods-Hong-Kong-craft-brand-evokes-local-culture-and-folklore,"Set up five years ago during the first wave of the city-state’s craft beer movement, Moonzen has embraced Cantonese culture from its branding and imagery to the ingredients it uses to flavour its beers.

Mexican Laszlo Raphael founded the company with his wife after losing his job on oil rigs in Libya after the Arab Spring. He had moved to Hong Kong with no experience of brewing and started to like the idea of making his own beer.

Starting off on a nano scale for the first two years, the company now produces 26,000 litres per month for the local market.

“I had no background whatsoever in beer, I was just an engineer with a curiosity about good beer,”​ said Raphael.

“The good thing about our brand is we have always had organic growth that’s been funded by the business and gone at our own pace. After a while I felt the operation should be yielded to professional people, that’s why now we have a full team of brewers, both local and from places like South Africa and the United States.”​

Hong Kong’s so-called craft revolution was underwhelming, he recalls, with four or five fellow brands in the first wave of five or so breweries. After these became popular, more brands arrived, as did many tiny brewing startups. Now he says the market is getting saturated with as many as eight breweries with sizeable production and there could be another 30 or so smaller operations.

Unlike other markets, craft beer prices are priced similar to mass-market beers like Sella Artois and Heineken. This is because a sizeable margin of the high prices Hongkongers pay goes to the vendor, and not the cost of production. And as the big players try to make their brewery-gate prices as low as possible, they in turn force the craft breweries to do the same.

“Also, the thing about Hong Kong is the distinction between macro beer and craft beer was never distinct, so consumers don’t pay a lot of money for an IPA versus a Tiger or Corona,”​ said Raphael.

“Beer is expensive in Hong Kong, but a lot of that margin isn't being taken up by the manufacturing side but by the outlets. These expect to make the same percentage margin from us as from Heineken or Carlsberg or any other macro brand.”​

Moonzen has maintained its position as a medium-sized craft brewery, but stands apart from he competition as the only one to incorporate Chinese flavours in its beers.

Moonzen will never bring a pumpkin spice stout, but it has produced a series of provincial beers that take their inspiration and an ingredient from the provinces they are named after. These include a Sichuan spicy porter and a Jianxi salted mandarin IPA.

“That gives us a very distinct identity which not many breweries in Asia or the world are doing that,” ​said Raphael. “Every beer has its own story that will connect drinkers to the culture. Our mission is to celebrate Chinese culture, craft and community through our beers.”​

The evolving Hong Kong craft beer market began largely within the sizeable expat population but has increasingly been attracting local support. It has become the nature of craft drinkers there to demand a regular turnaround of beer types including seasonal and limited editions, like Moonzen’s provincial series.

Its year-round menu includes Thundergod Ale, a flagship beer with a fresh taste of hoppy tropical fruits, Monkey King Amber AAle, Jade Emperor IPA and Moon Goddess Chocolate Stout. There are no prizes for guessing that Chinese gods are heavily represented in these beers.

After travelling around China, looking around and taking in different traditional stories, the husband and wife owners sketched down their ideas and gave them to a friend, an artist and typographer, to turn them into brand designs.

“Most of our inspiration has come from mythology, so we’re just retelling these stories through our beers. That’s what has inspired us to bring this aura of fantasy around our beers,”​ said Raphael.

He predicts the craft industry will see consolidation and then specialisation over the next five years or so. He also expects one or more international craft player to enter the market by buying a successful local brewery, while more tiny, niche players arrive, producing very small volumes.

Despite Hong Kong’s reputation for light regulation and a business-friendly environment, there is a great deal of red tape to negotiate.

“The thing about this place is it’s really easy to incorporate—you can have a company in only a day. But if you want to open a bank account, it’s going to take a lot of referrals and visits to the bank, and it’s really not easy at all,”​ said Raphael.

“The other thing is you need to have a food factory licence to produce beer in Hong Kong. And one you finally get this, there will be on-site inspections to make sure we are meeting their standards, just like a food company. But the biggest thing, though, aside from all the red tape, is the rent.”​

So far, business for Moonzen has been developing and it is well placed to accommodate the market as it expands with its distinctive beers and all their associated legends. With its roots in craft, Chinese culture and community, the door gods appear to be fulfilling their role of attracting good luck.",Beer of the gods: Hong Kong craft brand evokes local culture and folklore
"Just three years ago, burgeoning Fresca Juices set its sights on being “a pan-Indian player”. Now well on the way to achieving this, the brand’s next target centres on becoming “the top fruit juice brand in the country”.",22-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/news/markets/fresca-heralds-lofty-ambitions-as-fruit-drinks-firms-charge-into-the-hinterland/9474009-3-eng-GB/Fresca-heralds-lofty-ambitions-as-fruit-drinks-firms-charge-into-the-hinterland_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/22/Fresca-heralds-lofty-ambitions-as-fruit-drinks-firms-charge-into-the-hinterland,"This ambition was revealed recently when the Shri Bankey Behari Foods-owned Fresca announced last month it is aiming for a revenue milestone of INR1.5bn (US$21.5m) by next year, following annual growth of over 50%.

The packaged juice brand intends to build a 'strong presence' in regional markets across north India, while strengthening its distribution and improving availability across the rest of India. It aims to have 'substantially strengthened' its footprint by 2022.

“Having established ourselves amongst the top fruit juice brands in north and east India, we are now looking to build on the impressive reception that we have received from our customers and increase our pan-India presence by undertaking rapid expansion across the country,”​ said Akhil Gupta, Fresca’s founder and managing director.

“We have the capacity to fulfill the surge in demand, as we currently have a daily production output of 300,000 litres and 600,000 bottles when operating at full installed capacity. The market reception makes us confident that our explosive growth trajectory will continue for months and years to come.”​

Fresca offers a wider selection of packaged fruit juices than found elsewhere in the segment, counting lychee, nimbu pani (lime juice), guava, mango and apple in 160ml, 300ml, 2 litre and aseptic 200ml packs. It was also the first brand in India to introduce holographic holographic packs as a marketing gimmick.

Claiming to have the highest consumer repeat purchase rate within in the fruit juice market, Fresca achieved a quarter-on-quarter growth this year of 57% against 5% growth seen across the wider industry.

Launched in 2010, the company has been growing at a rate of 50% over the last three years, during which time it has outpaced the wider industry at a rate of four to one. It is now available in more than 200,000 outlets across north India alone, with efforts being made to increase its stock across key regional markets in northern and eastern India.

The brand has been adding 700-900 new outlets on a daily basis, while enhancing its distribution and retail supply chain. Its country head says the brand has made strong headway in the retail market by making its products available all the way down into the Indian hinterland.

“Our growth over the last few years is a validation of the strength of our distribution ecosystem,”​ said Ashok Chopra. “By expanding the number of physical outlets, we have made last-mile availability of juices possible for a much larger consumer base, thus making our presence felt in markets as deep as tier 4 cities.”​

It became common last year for companies to target cities with a population of 20,000 or less in a bid to further push healthier drinks. The growth of sugary carbonated drinks has been falling in recent years, though this trend had not been filtering down to the small towns that make up this largely untapped part of India.

Rural and semi-urban segments currently account for 60% of the juice market and have been growing faster than metros, according to PepsiCo.

To make their charge, the US-headquartered multinational and other brands in the category, including Fresca, have been packaging juices and juice-based drinks into smaller and more affordable PET bottles for rural purchase at around INR10 (US$0.14). Historically, consumers in these markets have opted for fizzy drinks.

“It makes more economical sense for customers in smaller towns,”​ said Gupta. “We have seen people coming in tractors to pick up crates of juices in villages.”​

But while all the segment players descended on this forgotten expanse as one, competition has become intense.

Having recently reintroduced the Slice juice-flavour brand in India PepsiCo, for one, has enlisted the world’s second biggest drinks franchisee, Varun Beverages, to help it grow into rural areas. The company aims to double sales of its Tropicana brand by next year as it takes its emphasis away from the carbonated lines in its portfolio.

Other fierce competitors include Dabur India, which is expanded its range with the launch of the Real Koolerz fruit beverage at a lower price point. It is also driving its 200ml packs into the lower-tier areas.

Fresca was said in January 2018 to be intent raising INR1bn (US$14.3bn) “over the next two years”​ through private equity to fund its ambition to be a national player. At the time, it was in talks with two PE funds in phases. It is not known how these talks have progressed.

Last month it entered the carbonated fruit drink segment under a newly created sub-brand, Fruzo. It is also said to be eyeing an entry into the snacks market by next year.

“We believe there is huge potential in the carbonated fruit drink segment,”​ Gupta told Hindu Businessline. “Currently, there aren’t many innovations being done in terms of flavours and variants. We believe we can tap into this potential by filling this gap in the market.”​

In some of Fresca’s northern stronghold markets, carbonated fruit drinks have been growing at a rate of around 30% a year. Under Fresca Fruzo, the company is launching four variants priced at INR10 and INR15 for 160ml and 250ml packs. The company also plans to launch a ginger ale variant later this year.

Despite the new launch, Fresca is continuing to focus on completing its beverages portfolio. Upcoming products are likely to include a zero-sugar product that uses a natural sweetener, Gupta said.

Meanwhile, the company is also exploring the snacks segment. “Sampling for snacks products has already started. We are finalising the products, variants and packaging. I believe by next year we will launch snacks products,”​ he added.",Fresca heralds lofty ambitions as fruit drinks firms charge into the hinterland
"Joining the market of cannabis-infused products is Phyx, a THC flavored sparkling water, which hopes its low-dose and fast-acting formula will better perform as an alcohol replacement.",22-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/article/2019/05/22/new-thc-water-offers-alcohol-alternative-phyx/9479711-1-eng-GB/New-THC-water-offers-alcohol-alternative-Phyx_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/22/New-THC-water-offers-alcohol-alternative-Phyx,"As cannabis laws loosen, there's been a rise in cannabis-infused beverage launches. Another THC drink is coming to Colorado this summer from Spherex, a brand that already sells vape products. Its latest project is Phyx, a THC sparkling water.

Phyx will tap into the popular flavored water and seltzer category, seeking to offer an alternative to hard seltzers in the industry. Spherex founder Niccolo Aieta wants to hit the “sweet spot of the market,”​ for people who are interested in trying THC but want to do it in a “safe and controllable way.”​

At 2.5mg of THC and 2.5mg of CBD per drink, Phyx has a relatively low dosage. Aieta told BeverageDaily that the Spherex team initially started out with a much more concentrated product, that people could dose with just a drop or two.

He said it performed well for the effects, but it wasn’t a product that people gravitated toward in social settings. This led them to look into a low-dose beverage, but faced challenges with masking the THC.

Aieta explained that the most common way to avoid strong odors, taste and separation from the oil is to add a third compound to help the beverage mix. But that often leads to a sour taste or cloudy appearance. Spherex decided to go “a little more high-tech”​ with nano-encapsulation.

For Phyx, the color and smell is removed during the refinement process of the oil before homogenization. This ensures that they don’t need to add a third component and emulsify the THC oil in water as clear and tasteless.

Avoiding the 'couch-lock' from other edibles

The technology for Phyx allows the drinker to feel the effects within minutes, says the brand, and then wear off within an hour. Aieta reports that it is less than half the time of a typical edible.

He believes that most consumers don’t want to be ‘couch-locked’ all day because of an edible. Phyx only lasts about an hour because the THC is absorbed through the tongue and does not have to go through the stomach or small intestine, according to Spherex. This is comparable to smoking cannabis.

Spherex felt like the edible market is already close to saturated with traditional dosages and effect-times. But because more consumers are now looking to cannabis drinks as an alternative to alcohol, they want them to perform like alcohol and provide those effects.

Many recent innovations in this space have in fact been positioned as alcohol replacements, marketed and packaged as craft beer. Ceria Brewing Co.​ launched in Colorado in December, Two Roots Brewing Co.​ launched THC and CBD drinks last summer, and High Style Brewing Co.​ debuted Coastal Haze in California this February.

Early Phyx customers are skewing female, and Aieta believes it will be a hit with adult women who may be looking for a new after-work drink. He said it is not targeted to the “super experienced cannabis user,”​ though they might enjoy it as a supplement to some of their other products.

Phyx is doing a soft launch in June, and it will then hit stores in Colorado in mid-July. It will launch with All-Natural, Lime, Grapefruit and Dragonfruit flavors. The drinks have no calories, sugar or carbs, and will be gluten free with all-natural ingredients. The company will pursue Nevada and California retail expansion in early 2020.",New THC water offers alcohol alternative ‘Phyx’
"After being acquired by fellow craft brewer Sierra Nevada earlier this year, Sufferfest Beer's brewing operations will move Sierra Nevada's Chico HQ.",22-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/article/2019/05/22/sufferfest-beer-moves-brewing-operations-and-increases-california-distribution/9490017-1-eng-GB/Sufferfest-Beer-moves-brewing-operations-and-increases-California-distribution_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/22/Sufferfest-Beer-moves-brewing-operations-and-increases-California-distribution,"Active lifestyle beer brand Sufferfest was launched three years ago in San Francisco, marketing its products as 'reward' beers. Following its acquisition by Sierra Nevada,​​ it is now moving its brewing and distribution operations from San Francisco to Sierra Nevada's Chico, California HQ.

The move allows ‘major expansion’ of Sufferfest's footprint in California thanks to Sierra Nevada’s reach, with increased availability in new and existing markets including Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Inyo, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Humboldt and Shasta.

Sufferfest says both it and Sierra Nevada share the same sustainability ethos: and the brewing move will help it meet its environmental goals. Sierra Nevada's facility in Chico has a 300-barrel brewhouse, which it says is equipped to offset nearly 90% of brewery electricity needs, save 2.5 million gallons of water per year and a compost program to help divert 99.8% of solid waste from the landfill.

Sufferfest has scaled back on its lineup recently, downgrading from five beers to three, made with ingredients like bee pollen, sea salt and blackcurrant. The company said they are all “designed to celebrate and support active humans, from the finish line of a race to a well-deserved rest day.”​

The Repeat Kolsch beer has 95 calories and 5g of carbs, with 3.5% ABV. Sufferfest says the added bee pollen keeps it light without sacrificing flavor or richness. The Fastest Known Time Pale Ale (FKT) is just a year old and is brewed with black currant and salt. And the Flyby Pilsner has a ‘malty richness’ with a ‘hint of spice.’ Sufferfest beers are gluten-removed.

The brand markets directly to the active consumer using partnerships with professional athletes and branded sports gear sold on its website. Founder Caitlin Landesberg developed the beer specifically to drink after taking long trail runs in California, and now sells at local restaurants, run and bike shops, climbing gyms and CrossFit locations across the state and Colorado.

“Whether you crushed it on the trails, had a big win at the office, flexed your weekend warrior, or shredded the gnar, you deserve our beer,”​ Sufferfest said.",Sufferfest Beer moves brewing operations and increases California distribution
"Meet Morning Recovery, the $33 million alcohol recovery supplement brand that beat 5-hour Energy and Emergen-C sales in 7-Elevens in Chicago.",22-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/010/9502622-1-eng-GB/image_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/22/Starting-in-the-alcohol-recovery-category-Morning-Recovery-maker-ready-to-expand-to-new-categories,"Liquid supplements served in shot-sized bottles that are marketed as an aid to help hangovers hurt less are nothing new—there are multiple brands on the market, none of them really dominating.

Ask a random person on the street if they can name energy drink brands, you’ll very likely get many answers. If you ask them to name a ‘hangover cure’ drink brand, you’ll probably have a hard time finding someone who can list even one brand name.

One brand that perhaps has a good shot at market dominance is Morning Recovery, which came to the world in 2017 after its founder Sisun Lee, a former product manager at Tesla, raised $250,000 on crowdfunding platform Indiegogo. The product is formulated around dihydromyricetin, or DHM, which appears naturally in Hovenia dulcis, ​also known as Oriental raisin tree.

In 2018, eight months after the product launch, its parent company More Labs​​ (at the time known as 82Labs) raised $8 million from venture capitalists. In a Medium post published by the company in August 2018, the company said it was worth $33 million​​.

Retail distribution was one of the first things the company focused on after its cash injection.

“We didn’t want to be a niche ecommerce company​,” founder Lee told us. “We thought the real advantage was in retail. You have to be in places where people have these use cases, where they can buy serendipitously, because no one plans on getting drunk, right?” ​

From the end of 2018 until now, the company has steadily increased its bricks-and-mortar distribution footprint, though the bulk of sales still happens online. Geographically, they’ve focused on three cities: San Francisco (where the company is based), Los Angeles, and Chicago.

“We picked these cities to build core density, and get a community behind [our product],”​ Lee said.

Doing well at 7-Eleven​

Morning Recovery’s main retail focus is ‘off-premise’ retailers, which means places where consumers can buy alcohol but can’t drink it there. This includes convenience stores, drug stores, and liquor stores.

One major development in Morning Recovery’s retailing history is distribution with 7-Eleven. “It has been pretty huge for us,”​ Lee said. “Because of the franchise model, brands need to get franchise-owner purchases, so you can’t just go national if the president at headquarters gives it a green light. In places like Chicago, it’s been really good.” ​

In fact, president of the Midwest branch of 7-Eleven Franchise Owners Association Jim Boyci told beverage industry trade publication BevNET that Morning Recovery beat other supplements such as 5-Hour Energy and Emergen-C in terms of volume and dollars for the six weeks he started selling it. “We’re very optimistic about 7-Eleven,” ​Lee told us.

When distribution isn’t about sales volume or revenue​

To beat the sales of a big brand name like 5-Hour Energy is especially impressive for a brand that’s playing in the hangover category, which has never really picked up in the US.

“In Korea, [where] the hangover drink market is about $200m annually, almost every single consumer product goods brand [has its] own hero brand of hangover drinks,”​ Lee told us​​ when he just wrapped up his Indiegogo campaign in 2017.

A more recent marketing study by hangover-cure company Bright Day found that 98% of people have never heard of products in the hangover space​​.In the US, products in the hangover cure category face competition against energy drink giants like 5-Hour Energy and thus have limited staying power, according to Euromonitor data from 2012. The company has not kept tabs of the category closely since, a spokesperson for the market research firm told us.

This is where distribution at ‘on-premise’ sites, where consumers can consume alcohol, can come in handy. “On-premise does not have as high of a following but we still focus a lot on it. For us it’s a marketing effort as well,”​ Lee said.

Examples include night club chain Tao. “All of their venues in Vegas actually buys Morning Recovery and sells it back to customers.”​ Another one is the social club chain Soho House. “These are places where it’s not truly for volume nor revenue for us, a lot of it is marketing play.”​

Lee has bigger aspirations that can’t be met relying on a hangover product alone. “There are a lot of products and start-ups positioned just to be within this new category that you can call ‘alcohol recovery’ or, I don’t know what it’s called,” ​he said.

“The volume has always been super low and there hasn’t been a huge brand.”​

Lee sees his main competition to be established products not​ part of this category, like Pedialyte (originally for pediatric hydration) and Gatorade (an electrolyte sports drink).

But the company recently hired an R&D-experienced head of product development, Dr Fu Chen, who has worked as a fellow at the FDA and senior scientist at chemical company Ashland and food company JM Smucker. With his work, they’ve formulated several new products poised to launch soon in the brain health (or nootropic) area.

“Over the first year [of business], the biggest thing we learned was understanding what was our value proposition, who were our customers and why are they buying our product or why are people not buying our product.”​

It’s not the college students or bachelor party goers that are their main customer. Rather, many of them white-collar workers with “super high disposable income”​ who are consuming the product more to be productive and less to prevent or soothe hangovers.

“The concept of hangover was just one element of it​,” he said. “There’s dehydration, lack of sleep quality, stress, and anxiety.”​

“Ultimately we want to build products that remove these modern-day stressors.” ​","Starting in the alcohol recovery category, Morning Recovery maker ready to expand to new categories"

Kantar called 2018 a ‘significant improvement’ for the Coca-Cola brand despite the fact that it is ‘in decline.’ It reported that Coca-Cola saw growth in every region last year except Mexico, its biggest market, which dropped by 7%.

Coca-Cola was picked from shelves 5.9bn times; Kantar found it performed best in markets where sugar taxes have been introduced.

“If Mexico had simply remained flat, the brand would have been in growth overall—reiterating the importance of any brand’s number one market,”​ Kantar said.

In France, Spain and the UK, Coca-Cola’s customers skew young with those under 35, while in Mexico it’s more popular with the older generations. Original Coca-Cola also lost out on 30% in volume due to consumers switching to Coke Zero, which did particularly well in the UK and China.

“Combining all nine markets we’ve looked at, under 35s represent less than a quarter of all the times the brand is chosen—while the over 50s account for almost 40%,”​ Kantar said.

“People over 50 are not just pensioners with grey hair. They also have higher disposable income on average, and arguably a greater desire for choice than the other two age groups. Shopper behavior is more complex and more nuanced than date of birth.”​

Global drink brands overall maintained a market share of 39.5% from 2017 to 2018, and local brands maintained a 60.5% share in the same time frame.

Kantar says out-of-home (OOH) purchases have a significant impact on the success of major soda brands like Coca-Cola and Pepsi because consumers are more likely to make impulse purchases when they are on-the-go without considering healthy choices.

OOH accounts for 41% of all spending for non-alcoholic beverages and snack food. Kantar analyzed OOH purchases in China, Brazil, France, Indonesia, Mexico, Portugal, Thailand and the UK for this year’s rankings. It found that Sprite’s OOH presence vs in-home grew 11% in 2018, while Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Fanta, Red Bull, 7-UP and Nestle Waters were also strong OOH.

Overall, Kantar’s top ten non-alcoholic brands OOH were Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Fanta, Sprite, Minute Maid, Red Bull, Nestle Waters, 7-UP, Nescafe and Oasis, respectively.

Kantar also ranked brands in e-commerce performance: Nescafe came in 8th, Pepsi was 22nd and Coca-Cola was 23rd. It said the five key countries driving growth in e-commerce are China, South Korea, Taiwan, France and the UK.

“When looking at all the brands growing in this year’s ‘Brand Footprint’ ranking, online has driven more than half (53%) of this growth on average. E-commerce commands less than 10% share versus other channels--meaning that, in the countries we’ve studied, e-commerce in fact drives five times as much growth as would be expected from its fair share,”​ Kantar said.","Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Nescafe top Kantar’s Brand Footprint rankings"
"Shifting consumer taste is causing major beverage companies to adapt, make ‘healthy’ drinks taste better and be more accessible. Coca-Cola is using its Freestyle machines and new bubbler dispensers to highlight its ‘craft, elevated’ drinks in the market.",23-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/coke-freestyle-1/9499941-1-eng-GB/coke-freestyle-1_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/23/Coca-Cola-cuts-back-on-sugar-with-bubbler-beverages,"Coca-Cola has been on a journey to transform into a ‘total beverage company’ and gradually reduce sugar across its entire portfolio, according to its 2018 Business and Sustainability report.

Some of the ways it has done that is by developing smaller, more convenient packages so controlling sugar intake is easier, and offering more drinks that provide health benefits like nutrition and hydration.

With updated distribution methods and reformulations, Coca-Cola is “evolving across categories”​ and creating a “whole new culture for the company.”​ Throughout the total global portfolio, Coca-Cola reformulated 310 beverages in 2017 and 400 in 2018.

“People’s tastes and preferences are changing, so we’re changing, too,”​ Coca-Cola said.

Speaking to BeverageDaily at the 2019 National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago, Chris Hellmann, Global VP and general manager of Coca-Cola Freestyle, explained that its Freestyle machines are helping promote the company's no and low calorie drink options. In fact, in the US today, half of the beverages offered by all Freestyle models are diet, low calorie or low sugar, while others have been reformulated to reduce calories.

The Freestyle machines first debuted in 2009, and the new Bluetooth-compatible 9100 operating system was on display at the show. The digital touch-screen platforms are in retail and restaurants, and the 9100 offers roughly 200 beverage options from one device.

Coca-Cola also showcased a new countertop version with more than 60 beverage options, the Freestyle 7100, better suited for small applications.

There are more than 52,000 Freestyle machines in use, mostly located in the US with 2,000 in Europe, and nearly six billion drinks are served through Freestyle every year.

In the US, ‘bubbler beverages’ are considered to be the next big component of the company’s presence in fast casual chains. The bubbler machines are designed to house “artisan-inspired juices, teas, ades and aguas frescas”​ that are typically prepared on-site from concentrates.

Lynwood Mallard, lead of category strategy and innovation at Coca-Cola North America, told BeverageDaily that the bubblers are now the choice home for the company’s ‘crafted’ beverages, or ones that may be perceived as healthier, with less sugar and fewer calories.

The bubbler is able to maintain temperature and keep products with particles constantly moving, so it doesn’t ever settle to the bottom and clog the drain. Older variations of the bubbler technology would spray the drink around, and the newer models are updated with a propeller.

Coca-Cola found that 62% of US consumers have had a bubbler beverage in the last six months, and they’re growing between 25%-30% every year. Operators can switch out drinks daily, keep them behind the counter or near other self-serve options.

The most in-demand bubblers drinks are original and flavored lemonade, like from its Minute Maid and Hubert’s Lemonade brands, but flavored teas and juices from Odwalla and Honest Tea are also popular in the bubblers. They are mostly attracting younger, affluent consumers.

Melinda Pritchett, senior manager of category strategy and innovation at Coca-Cola North America, told BeverageDaily, “As we innovate, we realize people have choices. So we’re here to help them make better choices. Meaning, if you prefer higher sugar, we have that. Now we’re developing in that lower sugar space, so you could say that we have something for everyone.”​

More options with less

In 2017 and 2018, Coca-Cola reported that it removed 425,000 tons of sugar from its products on an annualized basis through new recipes and smaller packaging sizes.

Its mini can design saw 30% growth last year in North America, and about 44% of its carbonated soft drinks now come in 8.5oz sizes or smaller.

It is part of a wider effort, as 95% of Coca Cola Chile’s drink portfolio is now comprised of low sugar and low calorie beverages, while Coca Cola Singapore has reduced the sugar in its Fanta and Sprite formulas by 40%. Similar efforts are being taken in markets around the world. Globally, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar saw double-digit volume growth in 2018.

Leading low sugar options in the Coca-Cola North America family include Coke Zero, Dasani Sparkling water, Honest Kids juice, VitaminWater Zero and many of the diet varieties of other brands, like Minute Maid and Sprite.

The original Coca-Cola recipe has also seen an overhaul, testing in Mexico with 30% less sugar. It removed 63,000 tons of sugar in the 2018 rollout, with more international markets expected this year.

Coca-Cola said it launched more than 600 products in 2018, particularly exploring those with vitamins, minerals and electrolytes, as well as dairy and plant-based beverages to meet consumer preferences.

“A big part of that is sugar reduction, because we know that people are eating and drinking less sugar, so we want to give them options to be able to do that,”​ Coca-Cola said.",Coca-Cola cuts back on sugar with bubbler beverages

“This time, in order to inform more customers of their unique functions as lactic acid bacteria (PA-3 lactic acid bacteria​ suppresses the rise in uric acid levels), a notification of functional labelling food was submitted and accepted,”​ the firm said.

The two products which were first launched in April 2015,​ are targeted at males between 30 and 60 years old, and the new versions will be available for sale from May 27. The recommended dosage is one tub or one bottle of the yogurt drink per day.

Japan has about 600k to 1m people suffering from gout, according to a study presented to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare last year.

The study also stated that the present challenges in addressing the prevalence of gout include non-treatment due to existing complications in patients and prevention and control of complications that may occur during treatment.

To address the prevalence of gout, FANCL also launched a capsule supplement for reducing uric acid levels​, also approved as a FFC last month.

On the other hand, the FFC system in Japan is into its fourth year this year, with 1,785 products gaining approval.

The system is said to have benefitted large corporations in terms of sales revenue, with Fancl as a classic example.

According to product trials, PA-3 lactobacillus is able to bring down uric acid levels in two weeks’ time.

Fourteen males with serum uric acid levels of 4.0 to 7.0 mg/dL were recruited into the trial.

They were then divided into two groups, with one group consuming the yogurt containing PA-3 lactobacillus and the other a placebo group. Both groups were required to take in 498g of purine daily.

Their serum uric acid levels were then measured during the 30th​, 60th​, 90th​, and 150th​ minute interval after consumption.

It was found that after two weeks, the group which consumed PA-3 lactobacillius saw their uric acid level decrease, with steeper decline at the 30th​ and 60th​ minute.

For example, the uric acid level dropped from 0.8 to less than 0.6 at the 30th​ minute and from 1.0 to slightly more than 0.8 at the 60th​ minute.",Meiji upgrades lactobacillus yoghurt and beverage to claim uric acid-suppressing ability
"Food and drink brands should avoid using dated male stereotypes in their advertising, says a study.",27-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator.com/article/2019/05/27/marketing-to-men-food-and-drink-brands-need-a-rethink/9513908-5-eng-GB/Marketing-to-men-Food-and-drink-brands-need-a-rethink_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/27/Marketing-to-men-Food-and-drink-brands-need-a-rethink,"“Many old-fashioned, dated and perhaps toxic views of masculinity are still prevalent among UK males​,” according to New Macho, a specialist men’s marketing arm of advertising company BBD Perfect Storm, after a survey of 2,000 adults in the UK.

This was “thanks in part to the stereotypes seen in advertising”, ​it claimed. Dated male stereotypes were a particular problem in alcohol advertising, it said, while male grooming products were “more reflective of modern male values and attitudes.”​

Around one in six men (15%) believe women should do the larger share of the cooking and cleaning in a relationship, rising to 19% among millennials (aged 22-37) and 22% of men in London, according to the research.

One in nine women (11%) agree with this view – rising to a quarter (25%) of women in London. Only 8% of UK adults see preparing a meal or cleaning the house as primarily male traits.

In addition, more than a quarter (27%) of men believe they should be the main financial providers for their family, rising to nearly half (43%) of men in London. In addition, one in six (17%) still think that for men to show vulnerability is a sign of weakness.

“The ad industry has to accept some of the blame for this,”​ said New Macho managing director Fernando Desouches. “Many food and drink brands are still portraying men either as aloof and hyper-competitive or as dorks and figures of fun. It’s all just gender stereotyping, which the Advertising Standards Authority is rightly working to eradicate.”​

He added that these beliefs were having a negative impact on mental health among males. “The groups that are most likely to hold these stereotyped views of masculinity – Londoners, millennials and high earners – are also the most likely to feel depressed or sad. More than half of these groups most often feel that way, so these beliefs may be having a very real and negative impact on men’s mental health.”​

Some brands are better than others at reflecting males’ attitudes and values, according to the study.

Brands like Nivea For Men and Mars came out fairly well – only 31% and 34% of men respectively thought they didn’t reflect their values. By comparison, 43% of men said Absolut Vodka didn’t reflect them at all; 49% say the same about Diet Coke and 54% think that way about Bacardi and Gordon’s Gin.

Similarly, nearly half of men (46%) feel the same about Guinness, 47% about Heineken and 48% about Johnnie Walker.

The study also revealed that despite the growing call for more attention to mental health among men, a quarter of males (25%) still hold to the view that ‘real men don’t crack under pressure’ – rising to 37% among millennials and 41% of Londoners. In addition, one in seven UK males (14%) think that ‘real men don’t cry’, jumping up to 27% of those in London.

Old fashioned ways of portraying masculinity are not connecting with men​

But the research also highlighted that many UK men are looking for a more sophisticated approach to masculinity: three-quarters (73%) believe men should talk more about their feelings, while 75% believe that ‘being a great father means always being there’ and 83% are of the view that fathers should support their children in whatever choices they make in life.

UK adults were also asked which British celebrity they feel best represents the ‘modern man’ – Prince Harry came first with 28%, followed by David Beckham on 25% and Idris Elba with 18% of the vote.

Fernando Desouches added: “In the same way that brands like Dove helped to change how advertisers portray women, there has to be a transformation in how FMCG brands market to men. Sadly, many of their current campaigns wouldn’t look out of place in the 1950s or 60s.​

“Instead, brands need to start using their ads and marketing to portray the subtlety, nuance and range of the modern male experience. Gillette, for example, may have courted controversy with its recent ad campaign and fallen into the trap of trying to clumsily force ‘progressive’ traits onto men, but it remains a brand with a lot of values that male consumers can buy into.​

“Men are changing, but for brands it’s more difficult to change. This way of portraying masculinity or men in communications that is more old fashioned is not connecting to them.”​

“Brands need to help men find a new aspiration. Ten years ago, it was very clear we needed to redefine what beauty was in the women sphere. Now we need to redefine what success is for men. Because the pressure that beauty and body image had on women is the now the pressure that success has for men.”​

Brands were perpetuating stereotypes that you are successful as a man for what you own and what you have and how you look, he said. “By creating these narrow aspirations for men, brands are stopping them move forward.”

He added: “Many food brands have the opportunity to talk to men and they are not doing that.” ​",Marketing to men? Food and drink brands need a rethink
"From canned cocktails to alcohol-free beer, we take a look at some of the new products hitting the shelves around the globe this month.",28-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/lowlander-0-beer/9516325-1-eng-GB/Lowlander-0-beer_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/28/What-s-hitting-the-shelves-New-product-launches-May-2019,"UK independent drinks producer Global Brands has developed two new canned cocktails, Shake Baby Shake and Beviamo, specifically for supermarkets.

Beviamo is reminiscent of an Italian spritz, combining bitter liqueur, Italian wine and soda water. It has 5.5% ABV per 250ml can and is available now at Sainsbury’s.

Shake Baby Shake launches with two flavors, Raspberry Mojito and Passion Fruit Martini. The drinks are non-carbonated, with a 4% ABV, sold in Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons.

Christian Sarginson, brand controller at Global Brands, said “We expect spritz drinks to again be ‘the’ drink of this summer. They were massively popular last year as drinkers moved more towards bitter-sweet tastes and looked to moderate their alcohol intake.”​

“Premiumisation, craft and experimentation have swept through the spirits and beer categories. They’ve changed how people drink, with more emphasis placed on quality, flavour and the ingredients.”​

St. Peter’s Brewery’s Without range of alcohol-free beer is adding a fourth option, the Without Elderberry & Raspberry. The UK-based brewer started the line three years ago in response to the growing demand for health and wellness-focused products.

John Hadingham, MD at St Peter's Brewery, said “There is a large and growing group of people looking for delicious craft beers that are 0.0% alcohol.”​

“Very few brewers have been able to create delicious, rich and full-bodied beers that are truly alcohol-free or that aren't de-alcoholised. And yet we now produce four bona fide 0.0% alcohol beers that are meeting the demands of consumers who either can't, or don't want to, consume any alcohol, but still want to enjoy a real pint.”​

The latest Without drink is described as sweet and tangy, with a “fruitiness of elderberries and the lingering taste of raspberries.”​ The other three flavors include Without Original, Gold and Organic.

A new premium Italian gin from Diageo is launching in 14 European countries. It coincides with the opening of a new distillery in Santa Vittoria which will source local ingredients for the Villa Ascenti gin.

Tanya Clarke, general manager of Diageo Reserve Europe, said “Gin has been the runaway success story of the industry over the last decade and its growth trend shows no signs of slowing down. Villa Ascenti Gin is rooted in provenance and brings local, fresh ingredients from Piemonte to life.”​

“Its use of locally grown ingredients from the foothills of Piemonte, alongside some of the more classic botanicals associated with gin, has allowed us to create a high-quality liquid, which we hope existing and new gin drinkers will love.”​

Master Distiller for Villa Ascenti Gin Lorenzo Rosso said, “On the nose, the mint and thyme are vibrant and refreshing alongside the spice of the Tuscan juniper berries, whilst on the palate, the Moscato grapes really come to life. Enhanced through copper distillation, the smooth, fruity flavour of this distillate rounds off zesty juniper notes to create a velvety, slightly sweet gin.”​

A new launch from Heineken Mexico is its first venture into the RTD category. Canijilla has two canned varieties, Mango Picosito and Lemon Cucumber with a 5% ABV.

Alejandro Berman, brand director of the Craft Beer and New Categories Portfolio at Heineken Mexico, said: “With Canijilla we are going to expand our market and get closer to consumers, young adults, who like to party and have fun.”​

Heineken says the drink is 100% inspired by Mexican culture, reflected in its colorful packaging. It is not categorized as a beer, but composed of locally sourced ingredients malt and dextrose with 130 calories per can.

“The alcohol contained in Canijilla is the result of the fermentation of sugars extracted from dextrose and malt,”​ Heineken said.

El Rayo brings its premium tequila from Mexico to launch in the UK, distilled from a blend of highland and lowland agave. Two expressions are being released, an unaged No.1 Plata and a No.2 Reposado, which is aged for 7 months in American white oak whiskey barrels.

According to El Rayo, “it harnesses both the citrus and floral notes of the highlands alongside the peppery, vegetal flavours commonly associated with the lowlands. It will be the first tequila of its kind on the UK market.”​

El Rayo partnered with Maestro Tequilero Oscar Garcia for this launch and grew the agave blend over the course of eight years. They are then roasted for 12 hours before being shredded and crushed to release the juices, distilled twice in 105-year-old copper stills.

The Sparkling Craft Iced Teas launched in the Northeast and Midwest US last year with Blackberry Lime Green Tea and Unsweetened Sparkling Peach Nectarine Green Tea. It’s now expanding nationwide and adding Sparkling Blood Orange Mango White Tea.

Teavana said the sparkling RTDs are “refreshing, bubbly iced teas made with fine tea, botanicals, and no artificial flavors.”​ It shared that more than 15 million bottles of Teavana Craft Iced Teas in partnership with Anheuser-Busch.

The three sparkling flavors add to Teavana’s portfolio of nine craft iced tea RTDs, sold in retailers across the US in 14.5oz bottles.

Lowlander Beer from the Netherlands is adding a non-alcoholic option to its lineup. The 0.00% Wit (White) Beer will be available in the Netherlands, the UK and Germany this summer, brewed with reclaimed citrus peel from bars and restaurants.

The company already sells five beers in its core range as well as two botanically brewed low alcohol 2.5% beers.

Lowlander Founder Frederik Kampan said, “With more than a quarter of young people considering themselves non-drinkers and 1 out of 20 beers being no low or no alcohol, we felt the time was right to launch our 0.00% Lowlander Beer.”​

“We’re also delighted to be able to reuse natural botanical ingredients to brew our beer. Every year 250 million kilos of orange peel are discarded in The Netherlands and we are working with PeelPioneers who pick up and process this 'waste' in a circular, eco-friendly way.”​

The Boys and Girls Clubs of San Francisco and Happy Moose Juice, a local cold-pressed juice company, have teamed up to develop a new smoothie to benefit the Club and the youth participants.

The ‘Hella Berry’ smoothie consists of strawberries, blueberries, pineapple, apple, banana, beets, lemon, coconut milk and water. It’s available at California retailers like Bi-Rite Market, Boudin Bakery Cafes, Rainbow Grocery and The Mill, returning 20% of all profits to the Club.

“Happy Moose Juice’s CSR program focuses on teaching entrepreneurship, community building, and healthy living to local youth. This program marks another new development for the young business which supplies signature recipe, cold-pressed juices via wholesale to natural grocers, as well as various food service retail businesses throughout California, and directly to Bay Area corporate offices,”​ Happy Moose Juice said.

Matcha and coffee pod producer Rokit has launched five new flavors: Matcha & Cacao, Matcha & Turmeric, Barley Coffee, Hotter Chocolate and Turmeric Delight.

The pods are compatible with Nespresso machines and available in the UK. Rokit nicknames them ‘Superpods’ and says they are comprised of “locally sourced ingredients, ethically farmed by local people from all over the world.”​

The pods are sold in packs of 10 on Rokit’s website, and the new flavors join its three existing flavors Matcha Green Tea, Ultimate Coffee and Yerba Mate.

UV Vodka has launched a new line of RTD canned cocktails, UVGO. The flavored sparkling drinks will debut with Blue Raspberry, Lemon Lime, Black Cherry and Pink Lemonade.

With a 5% ABV and under 150 calories per can, it will be sold in four-packs of slim 12oz cans at nationwide retailers this summer.

"Plastic bottles in the EU will contain at least 30% recycled content by 2030, according to European Union targets. EU member states have also agreed to achieve a 90% collection target for plastic bottles by 2029.",21-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/article/2019/05/21/european-council-sets-out-30-recycled-content-target-for-plastic-bottles/9496930-1-eng-GB/European-Council-sets-out-30-recycled-content-target-for-plastic-bottles_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/21/European-Council-sets-out-30-recycled-content-target-for-plastic-bottles,"The targets are outlined in the Council’s directive on single-use plastic products,​ which has formally been adopted today.

The plastic bottled recycled content targets will be calculated as an average for all PET bottles placed on the market in each member state.

From 2025, PET bottles will have to contain at least 25% recycled plastic. From 2030, they will have to contain at least 30% recycled plastic.

The targets cover plastic bottles with a capacity of up to three litres, including caps and lids. Those used for beverages with a medicinal purpose will be exempt.

“In order to ensure the circular use of plastics, the market uptake of recycled materials needs to be promoted. It is therefore appropriate to introduce requirements for a mandatory minimum content of recycled plastic in beverage bottles,” ​says the council.

The single-use plastics directive sets out stricter rules for products and packaging which most frequently pollute European beaches. Single-use plastic plates, cutlery, straws, balloon sticks and cotton buds will be banned by 2021.

Meanwhile, collection targets for plastic bottles are being raised to help address litter from these items.

From 2025, 77% of single-use plastic bottles must be collected; and from 2029, 90% of bottles should be collected.

“Beverage bottles that are single-use plastic products are one of the marine litter items that are found the most on beaches in the Union,”​ says the council.

“This is due to ineffective separate collection systems and low participation in those systems by consumers. It is necessary to promote more effective separate collection systems. Therefore, a minimum separate collection target should be established for beverage bottles that are single-use plastic products.”​

Manufacturers and industry organisations have also made efforts to set collection and recycling targets.

Last year, the European Federation of Bottled Waters, which represents around 600 natural mineral and spring water producers, set targets to use an average of at least 25% rPET in plastic bottles and collect 90% of all PET bottles by 2025.​​

Coca-Cola European Partners has pledged to collect 100% of packaging and use 50% recycled plastic in PET bottles in Western Europe by 2025.​​

PepsiCo is aiming to use 50% recycled plastic in its bottles across the European Union by 2030:​​ up from 13% today and with an interim target of 45% by 2025.",EU sets out 30% recycled content target for plastic bottles

“Our R&D team analyzed the beer and used pairing recommendations from Samuel Adams to craft the perfect chip that complements the Samuel Adams New England IPA,"" he said. ​

""The result is a chip and beer pairing that captures the taste of summer - whether you’re at the beach or enjoying your lunch break​.

“For the chip packaging, we worked to evoke the feelings of summer and designed it to match IPA’s pale amber colors and orange gradient can​.”

Every time a consumer changes from a 500ml bottle of Classic or Blue to an equivalent bottle of Zero or Max, there is a reduction of over 200kcal. Cutting sugar in soft drinks will not, by itself, cure the nation's health problems, but it has got a key government nutrition policy, the Childhood Obesity Plan, off to a rapid start.

The sales shifts are principally the result of price differentials that SDIL immediately opened up between full sugar drinks (more than 8g sugar per 100ml) and levy-free no/low sugar products (less than 5g/100ml).

In our shop surveys during April last year, immediately after the levy came into operation, we recorded discounts of 11-25% on small single bottles and cans in the front-of-store impulse sector, and 20-39% on large-bottle family purchases.

Thus, SDIL met the principle of the World Health Organization, ""...taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages...needs to induce a consumer price preference for beverages with a lower content of free sugars, to ensure healthy diets"".

It also impacted on the real world. For a year now, consumers have had economic incentives to purchase no/low sugar drinks, not just moral injunctions. The changed sales figures show that discounts have had the effect that economists expected and health specialists hoped for.

The movement towards no/low sugar drinks is likely to continue, indeed expand. We have just completed an enlarged range of shop surveys in supermarkets, pharmacies, takeaway food multiples and independents, to measure the effects of SDIL after one year.

Discounts continue at roughly the same level as before. And, following the reformulation of most products to lower their sugar content and thus avoid the levy, there are only two full sugar products of public health significance on the British market, Classic Coke and Blue Pepsi

What is different over the past year is that new sugarfree variants of popular drinks, produced in response to the levy, have gained distribution in major retailers. They are now much more accessible to consumers.

All the new versions of Coca-Cola's subsidiary brands are now appearing on shelves -- Fanta, Dr Pepper and Sprite, even Lilt and Oasis. AG Barr's iconic Irn Bru currently comes in two new sugarfree variants, as well as the reformulated, lower-sugar version of the original product.

Less expectedly, virtually all major brands of energy drinks have also introduced sugarfree variants.

No longer just sugarfree Red Bull, now also no sugar versions of Lucozade, Monster, Relentless, Rockstar, Emerge, Boost, and Carabao are gaining shelf space in an already crowded category -- with Big Brother, sugarfree Coca-Cola Energy, just entering the market. All eight supermarket groups we surveyed stock these new energy drinks, the majority carry four or five sugarfree brands.

For Lucozade, Ribena, Suntory, which reformulated 60 products in response to the levy, its new sugarfree energy drink, Lucozade Zero, has been the most successful launch in the company's history.

Most of the no/low products now on shelf use the established sweeteners, aspartame and AceK. But the controversies over sugar are stimulating development of many new substitute ingredients, from ""natural"" sweeteners like stevia to lower-calorie versions of sugar itself. In time, they too will stimulate innovative no/low products.

One factor limiting the shift towards reformulated drinks is the erratic price marking of the different options on shelves. This means customers are not alerted to the discounts available. Not just in small independents, but also in supermarkets and takeaway multiples, price tickets on shelves are sometimes missing.

Nonetheless, the key finding this year is that the SDIL has rapidly produced a significant shift towards no/low drinks. And the increased accessibility of many new sugarfree products should have a further impact on the sales balance in future years.",UK sugar tax: Historic sales shift to sugar-free

Single-use plastic refers to all products that are wholly or partly made of plastic, and are intended to be used just once before being disposed of.

This week, governments across the EU brought disposable plastics into the spotlight with legislative measures and state-funded studies addressing the single-use plastics problem.

Following an open consultation, the UK government has decided to ban the distribution and sale of plastic straws, drink stirrers and plastic-stemmed cotton buds in England.

The ban responds to overwhelming support to discourage the use of disposable plastics. According to the consultation, 80% of respondents support a ban on the supply of plastic straws, 90% a ban on stirrers, and 89% a ban on cotton buds.

The ban will be instated in April 2020, with exemptions for medical and scientific purposes.

In catering and foodservice, restaurants and bars will not be able to display plastic straws, but can provide them on request. The government will carry out a stocktake after one year to assess the impact of these measures.

For Environment Secretary Michael Gove, the ban has been informed by a need to tackle plastic pollution and protect the environment. “These items are often used for just a few minutes but take hundreds of years to break down, ending up in our seas and oceans and harming previous marine life.”​

Campaign group Surfers Against Sewage has welcomed the government’s decision. “Stopping the production and distribution of these single-use plastic menaces will prevent them from polluting beaches nationwide. It’s a really positive and bold step in the right direction in the battle against plastic pollution.​

“It also helps further drive plastic-free options and alternatives for the public so they can truly make more sustainable choices in their daily lives,”​ said CEO Hugo Tagholm.

The European Council has adopted new rules regarding single-use plastics across the bloc, in an effort to reduce ocean pollution.

The legislation sees selected single-use products made of plastic – for which alternatives exist on the banned in all Member States. This

The ban also covers single-use plastic cups, food and beverage containers made of expanded polystyrene, and all products made of oxo-degradable plastic. The Council has also implemented measures to reduce the use of food containers and drink cups made of plastic.

Member States will have approximately two years to instate the legislation into their national law.

A separate plastic collection target was also adopted. The EU aims to collect 90% of all plastic bottles by 2029 – including a milestone target of 77% by 2025 – and will introduce the design requirement to connect caps to bottles.

The Council also requires manufacturers to incorporate 25% of recycled plastic in PET bottles from 2025 and 30% in all plastic bottles as from 2030.

""Plastic straws or forks are little objects but can make great, long-lasting damages​. The single-use plastics legislation will address​ 70%​ of marine litters items, avoiding environmental damage that would otherwise cost €22 billion by 2030,”​ stated commissioner for environment, maritime affairs and fisheries, Karmenu Vella.

“The EU has delivered fast and effectively on a proposal the Commission presented just one year ago. All in all, it's European legislation at its best – responding to popular demand, benefiting the planet as well its inhabitants, and genuinely leading the world.""​

A study revealing that 5,300 disposable cups are used per minute in Germany has prompted a call for governmental action.

The study, which was commissioned by Germany’s Federal Environmental Agency, found that 2.8 billion disposable cups were used for hot drinks in 2106. 3 billion were used for cold beverages.

These figures equate to an annual consumption of 70 disposable cups per capita – 34 for hot drinks, and 36 for cold.

According to not-for-profit environmental and consumer protection association Environmental Action Germany (DUH), just a fraction of these disposable cups is recycled.

Indeed, coffee cups – which typically contain a mixture of paper and plastic in their inner lining to retain both heat and liquid – require more complex infrastructure to recycle than either material on its own.

To address this problem, DUH is demanding a levy of 20c be charged on disposable cups and 10c on disposable lids.

The association has also recommended the introduction of a mandatory reduction target of 70% by 2022.

""Every minute, 5,300 disposable cups for coffee, tea and other hot drinks are produced in Germany, resulting in a waste bin of 2.8 billion cups throughout the year, which is a cause for concern because not only are resources wasted…these cups also land very often in the environment, so we need ambitious legal regulations that are much more effective than voluntary agreements with the economy could ever be,” ​said DUH deputy federal managing director Barbara Metz.

“We call for the introduction of a mandatory reduction target of 70% and a levy on disposable cups and lids – self-commitments have so far not solved any environmental problems in the long term.”​

DUH is also pushing for more action to favour the use of reusable cups. According to the study, a plastic reusable cup becomes ecologically superior to a disposable after approximately 20 refills. Reusable cups have a lifespan of at least 50 uses within one year.

""As an alternative to disposable cups, consumers can drink their classic coffee locally from a cup, bring their own refillable cup for refilling or enjoy the drink from a returnable cup.​

“The easier the cup return, the greater the acceptance by the consumers. A delivery and an ambitious reduction target for disposable cups in particular, would greatly increase the participation of large coffee house chains and canteen operators in pool cup systems,” ​explained DUH head of circular economy, Thomas Fischer.","Single-use round-up: EU, England, and Germany address disposable plastics"

"Citrus has always been a summer staple - but the category is evolving with exotic varieties and spicy combinations. As the warmer months approach in the northern hemisphere, we take a look at how citrus is springing onto shelves this year.",17-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/punchy_13-small/9410588-2-eng-GB/PUNCHY_13-small_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/17/A-study-in-citrus-New-beverage-launches-summer-2019,"Lemon, orange and grapefruit are citrus stalwarts: but new exotic varieties such as pomelo, calamansi and yuzu are making a big impression in 2019, particularly in premium drinks.

Bud Light is expanding its citrus peels portfolio with a new Bud Light Lemon Tea (pictured above).

The new product is a light lager brewed with real lemon peels and aged over real black tea leaves to give the beer a ‘distinct flavor profile’.

“Bud Light Lemon Tea complements the already popular Bud Lime and last year's number one new beer innovation, Bud Light Orange which are also brewed with real lime and orange peels,”​ says the Anheuser-Busch brand.

Bud Light Lemon Tea is available across the US until September.

The tequila punch comes in two varieties: one with a 4% ABV and an alcohol free version.

The drinks are vegan friendly, gluten-free and low in calories (129kcal per bottle and 52kcals respectively).

The sugar content is under 9.9g per bottle, coming in under the UK's sugar tax threshold.

“We're breathing new life into a classic, while making sure everyone has the freedom to choose and still be involved whether they drink or don't,""​ says the brand. ​

""Taking summer flavours that work together, and pushing them that bit further with some extra spice, we think we have got something really exciting. ​

""The intense summer flavours are inspired by classic tequila-based cocktails, Paloma and Picante, and are made with all natural and authentic ingredients.""​

Super-premium brand Effen Vodka has added yuzu citrus to its lineup: a drink that seeks to 'bring a dynamic taste profile' into the vodka category.

""Effen Yuzu Citrus was created to embody the subtle beauty of Yuzu, a Japanese fruit described as a flavor profile that resembles a combination of lemon and grapefruit,""​ explains the Beam Suntory brand. ""Growing in popularity amongst chefs and mixologists for its aromatic flavor, this trend-forward innovation provides a sweet flavor with a citrus finish.""​

The drink can be served neat or with grapefruit club soda. It has been launched alongside another new flavor, Effen Rosé.

US brewer Samuel ‘Sam’ Adams has rebrewed its seasonal favorite Summer Ale with ‘lighter and brighter’ flavors.

In 2019 it’s getting its first recipe refresh in 23 years, with additions of pureed oranges, limes and lemons: boosting the citrus profile and scaling back the earthier spice notes.

While acknowledging that changing a long-standing recipe is a risk, the Sam Adams brewers say the change will improve drinkability.

PepsiCo has launched a ‘new fun and fruity flavor’, Pepsi Lime, for the US summer.

Launched alongside Pepsi Berry and Pepsi Mango, Pepsi Lime offers “an ​unique twist on cola … that is unparalleled in the marketplace, creating a refreshing way for people to cool off in the warm weather.""​

Pepsi Lime is made by adding ‘a splash of real fruit juice to cola, creating a bolder flavor experience’.

The choice of flavors has been designed to ‘enhance the original taste of cola’ and ‘provide a Japan-original taste’.

The cola is available in two varieties: regular sugar and zero calories.

Corona Refresca - the first flavored malt beverage in the brand's 37 year history - is 'bringing a taste of the tropics' to the US market.

The 4.5% ABV premium alcohol-spiked refresher comes in three flavors: passionfruit lime; guava lime and coconut lime. Each drink contains 199 calories per 12 ounce serving.

Corona is the top import beer brand family in the US, and hopes to build on its brand equity​​ and 'tropical and carefree attitude' with the new line.

Coca-Cola has launched its first sugar-free flavoured water under the brand “I LOHAS” in Japan this month.

The product contains only mineral water, lemon juice and lemon flavour extract.

I LOHAS is an acronym for lifestyles of health and sustainability. Since its launch in 2009, the brand has also created mineral water with aloe, tomato, peach, apple and pear flavors.

Coca-Cola has launched two orange flavor innovations in the US this year: Orange Vanilla Coke and Orange Vanilla Coke Zero Sugar.

The flavors – which are the first Coca-Cola trademark flavor innovations in a decade in the country – seek to ‘bring back positive memories of carefree summer days’​ with nostalgic cues of creamy orange popsicles.

Global brewing giant AB InBev will be launching non-alcoholic beers in India across the next three months under two major brands: Budweiser and Hoegaarden.,20-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-asia.com/headlines/business/zero-alcohol-in-india-ab-inbev-to-launch-budweiser-and-hoegaarden-non-alcoholic-beers-in-the-country/9475328-1-eng-GB/Zero-alcohol-in-India-AB-InBev-to-launch-Budweiser-and-Hoegaarden-non-alcoholic-beers-in-the-country_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/20/Zero-alcohol-in-India-AB-InBev-to-launch-Budweiser-and-Hoegaarden-non-alcoholic-beers-in-the-country,"Capitalising on the growing interest in the non-alcoholic beer category in Asia​, AB InBev looks to offer its consumers ‘choice’ when it comes to consumption in this category.

“The launch of non-alcoholic beers in India is in line with our global goal to offer low and non-alcoholic beverages to consumers [in line with] our Global Smart Drinking Goals,”​ AB InBev South Asia President Ben Verhaert told FoodNavigator-Asia.​

“[One of these goals is] Empowering Consumers Through Choice, [and through this we aim] to ensure that No or Lower alcohol beer products make up at least 20% of our global beer volume by 2025.”​

In 2018, 8% of AB InBev’s global beer volumes came from low and no-alcoholic beverages globally. Within this, Budweiser was identified as the ‘fastest growing premium brand’​ in India, whereas Hoegaarden is ‘one of the leading super premium brands’​ in the country.

“The launch of Budweiser 0.0 [and Hoegaarden 0.0] ​will further enable the [brands] to be inclusive, as many people today do not drink alcohol. [We want] to offer the great taste of beer that can be enjoyed across different occasions [when alcohol cannot be consumed],”​ added Verhaert.

The main difference in processing between the non-alcoholic beers and regular ones is in the de-alcoholisation process, but he added that AB InBev goes beyond just this to maintain flavour.

“[We] have also changed the brewing process a bit to avoid the acidity that would come from de-alcoholisation [so as to] create a more balanced taste of real beer (sic),”​ he said.

Budweiser 0.0 and Hoegaarden 0.0 will be launched over the next three months in what was described as ‘the top urban centres in the country’​, such as Mumbai and Delhi.

The non-alcoholic beers will also be sold in the prohibition state of Gujarat where the manufacture, storage, sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages is illegal, and there is a death penalty in place for any person who has ‘manufactured, kept, sold or arranged for [spurious liquor]​’.

The Budweiser and Hoegaarden zero-alcohol beers are actually not AB InBev’s first non-alcoholic beers in the APAC region.

“We [also] launched Carlton Zero non-alcoholic beer in Australia last year for beer lovers who want more opportunities to enjoy beer responsibly,”​ said Verhaert.

“We [also] have non-alcoholic beers globally across our major markets – North America, South America, Europe, Africa and Asia. Budweiser 0.0 is already available in Canada and the United Kingdom.”​

Competitor Heineken also launched its own version of non-alcoholic beer under its Low and Non Alcohol (LNA) category, the Heineken 0.0​ in Singapore earlier this year.

Heineken 0.0 and Bavaria 0.0% are currently also available in Thailand, where the government is examining the laws governing the zero-alcoholic beer category​.

Heineken 0.0 is made with normal beer ingredients (water, malted barley, hop extract) and brewed with Heineken’s unique A-yeast, but the alcohol is removed ‘gently’​ in a ‘natural process’​​.

“[Our] unique recipe [makes] for Heineken 0.0’s distinct balanced taste, and each 330ml bottle contains only 69 calories,”​ Andy Hewson, Managing Director of Asia Pacific Breweries Singapore (APBS) told FoodNavigator-Asia​ previously. ​APBS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Heineken Group, and and operates its local brewery in Singapore.

AB InBev’s non-alcoholic beers will also have less calories as compared to the alcoholic versions.

“[The] calories in non-alcoholic beers will also be less than carbonated soft drinks. For example, Budweiser 0.0 will have 25.59 kcal/100ml, which is around 40% less than that of a carbonated soft drink,”​ added Verhaert.

With regard to NPD, he said that although AB Inbev’s main focus in the coming months will be centred on the two non-alcoholic beers, its innovation team would still be ‘working relentlessly’​ to develop products according to different market requirements.",Zero alcohol in India: AB InBev to launch Budweiser and Hoegaarden non-alcoholic beers in the country
Singaporean coconut water brand Cocoloco is moving on from its traditional business of supplying fresh coconut to the food and beverage manufacturing industry with its naturally pink coconut water now available in several major retail outlets.,16-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-asia.com/headlines/business/crazy-for-coconut-water-singapore-s-cocoloco-emphasises-raw-and-natural-with-its-pink-offering/9421236-1-eng-GB/Crazy-for-coconut-water-Singapore-s-Cocoloco-emphasises-raw-and-natural-with-its-pink-offering_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/16/Crazy-for-coconut-water-Singapore-s-Cocoloco-emphasises-raw-and-natural-with-its-pink-offering,"Cocoloco’s parent company is Siam Coconut Pte Ltd, a well-known supplier of Thai coconuts for big food service outlets such as Jumbo Seafood and Thai Express.

Having been in the coconut industry for over 18 years, the family-run business was revitalised after Kelvin Ngian, whose father owns the company, came in with fresh perspective.

“There was a sudden [surge in] interest in packaged coconut water when I joined the company about seven years back, [but] after trying all the options [available], I felt like none of them tasted like the actual thing,” ​Ngian, who is also General Manager of Siam Coconut, told FoodNavigator-Asia.​

“So [my approach] to creating the next best thing to an actual coconut, [which was also the easiest], to simply empty the coconut into a bottle [and sell it].”​

He added that the ‘purist’​ approach to coconut water not only worked, but keeping things pure and raw added the appeal for consumers.

“So that’s how Cocoloco was born – [Loco is] a word play on both local and crazy,”​ he explained.

As for the aesthetic aspect of the product, being that it is a pretty pink in colour, Ngian claimed this to be a 100% natural occurrence.

“That is probably the most asked question of all – a lot of people think we add colouring or flavouring,”​ he said.

“But truth be told, we add absolutely nothing to our coconut water.​

“Cocoloco turns pink because of a natural reaction between light and a natural antioxidant called polyphenols found in coconut water. And because we are raw (meaning we don’t cook our coconut water), these polyphenols react with light and turn pink naturally.”​

All of Cocoloco’s coconuts come from Thailand, and the pink coconut water is currently only available in Singapore.

“We are targeting further regional expansion within the next five years,” ​said Ngian.

Intelligence agency Arizton has predicted that the global coconut water market will surpass the US$8.3 billion mark by 2023, with a CAGR of 25% across the six years from 2017 to 2023.

The Asia Pacific region is expected to lead globally in terms of packaged coconut water consumption, particularly in India, China, Indonesia and Australia.

The pink bottled coconut water is currently available at products are available at Cold Storage and NTUC supermarkets, online at Redmart and Goodsome, specialty food store Little Farms and other selected F&B retailers.

Responding to queries about local demand for products such as Cocoloco’s, Ngian admitted that selling coconuts back to a tropical country is a ‘tricky’​ process.

“Because we come from a tropical country where fresh fruits are readily available, it’s always a challenge to sell a ‘processed’ fruit juice back to the community,”​ he said.

“I feel that the local market is tricky, [but]​ I believe the consumers are evolving, people are willing to pay a bit more for convenience and for quality.”​

In terms of keeping up with current trends, he added that Cocoloco was ‘on the right track’,​ as consumers are becoming more conscious of what they eat and use.

The 2020s are expected to be shaped by Gen Z, with further digitization of brands using smart technology.",16-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/article/2019/05/16/a-complex-consumer-base-challenges-us-alcohol/9470176-1-eng-GB/A-complex-consumer-base-challenges-US-alcohol_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/16/A-complex-consumer-base-challenges-US-alcohol,"There’s a lot driving the new frontier in alcohol. Brands are competing to secure the health and wellness-conscious customer, with innovations turning into a calorie race.

At the 2019 Beverage Forum, representatives from alcohol’s biggest players discussed challenges facing beer, spirits and wine in the next decade. Like the 2010s, the 2020s are expected to be driven by growth in craft sectors and young drinkers.

In 2018 wine and spirits led alcohol growth while beer volume declined by 1%. The slowdown was impacted by the rise in beverages with functional ingredients and low calorie counts, according to the Beverage Marketing Corporation (BMC).

Major beer brands have continued to lose market share, while craft beer is experiencing growing pains. Since 2012, the top four brewers in the US have lost a combined 7.1 share points in aggregate.

A key trend for the category is high end beers, which are taking market share from mainstream and value beer.

Marcel Marcondes, US chief marketing officer at Anheuser-Busch, thinks companies need to ‘deeply understand’ what consumers are looking for in order to be successful today. Major corporations can’t win with just one or two good brands, but should build up a strong and full portfolio.

“The consumer base has never been as complex as it is today,”​ he said.

Since 2010, spirits have been the best-performing category when compared to beer and wine. Craft spirit dollars have grown at annual rate of 26.2% in this time frame, and in terms of volume craft had a 3.1% share of total spirits in 2018.

According to BMC, on-premise volume for spirits increased by 0.3% in 2018, which was mainly driven by the strength of small, independent full-service restaurants. Flavored vodka and whiskey started out with a strong decade, but both are now declining in sales and innovation.

But flavor is still a focus area for craft distillers. Specialized cocktails are being made using specific types of new spirit styles--sour cherry gin, peppermint whiskey, and hybrids like rose wine vodka are all gaining popularity.

Alternate aging methods have also found a place in the industry, like rum finished in vermouth casks, Irish whiskey finished in stout barrels and straight whiskey finished in maple syrup barrels.

Thomas Murray, Founder and CEO at MurLarkey Distilled Spirits, predicts that craft spirits are the next big thing, particularly because larger brands are starting to hop on the bandwagon with their own versions.

Millennials make up 32% of US spirits consumption by value, according to Murray, and the $44bn US spirits market is expected to grow 6% per year through 2022.",A ‘complex’ consumer base challenges US alcohol
"The rare sugar nigerose can now be “easily” produced via a process that “can readily be scaled up for potential industrial purposes,” claims a breakthrough study.",15-May-2019,,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/15/Rare-sugar-researchers-hit-sweet-spot-with-nigerose-production,"Rare sugars hold great potential for practical applications – as sweeteners, for instance – in the food industry. But few have been exploited commercially due to their scarcity in nature, which prevents them from being isolated in large quantities.

Nigerose is a rare sugar with potential immune-boosting and probiotic effects. It occurs in nature as a constituent of polysaccharides such as nigeran. It is also found in Japanese rice wine or sake, hence its alternative name, sakebiose.

“Nigerose has been shown to exert immunopotentiating activity in mice; it has potential as a prebiotic; it has been evaluated as an additive in cryopreservation media for human cell lines and it has been applied as a building block for promising biocompatible nanocarriers for sustained drug delivery.”​

Previous methods of producing nigerose were too expensive ​

Previous research discovered that nigerose could be synthesized by adding the powerful solvent DMSO. But this process was found to increase overall production costs. Researchers at Ghent University, in a study published in the Royal Society of Chemistry​ journal, looked at the alternatives for the “efficient synthesis of nigerose from sucrose and glucose”​ without using DMSO, “thereby adding to the inventory of rare sugars that can conveniently be produced from bulk sugars.”​

They discovered a cheap and convenient way of making enough nigerose from table sugar so that its potential use in the food industry can be explored.

The researchers designed a mutant transglycosylase “that allows the rare disaccharide nigerose to be produced efficiently and conveniently, starting from cheap, renewable and abundant bulk sugars in aqueous solution,” ​they wrote.

""Because nigerose can now easily be produced on multi-gram scale as was demonstrated in this work, its properties can be thoroughly evaluated moving forward.

It can also be equipped with a nitrogen dosing system to reduce the oxygen in the headspace of the pouch, which limits the chemical deterioration (oxidation) of the product, helping maximize product shelf life in the process.

The company says it has already received its first order from a company in Europe for infant nutrition.

“Apart from capacity and aseptic integrity, the AsepFlex Filler offers flexibility​,” said Bert Krakers, product manager, JBT.

“Pouch formats and sizes can be changed on the fly without the necessity to change parts​.”

According to JBT, the flexible packaging market is growing, with pouches becoming the preferred option for processors and consumers because they are non-breakable, lightweight, easy to open, and easy to empty (squeezable) characteristics.

For example, flexible pouches in the infant nutrition category are expected to grow their market share by 10% each year.

But Krakers claims growth is restricted by limits to current pouch filling technology.

He added, technology using an aseptic form fill seal typically have a low capacity and a high Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) due to a high rejection rate. And, hot fill with retort sterilization has low (120ppm) capacity and low product quality.

Krakers said the JBT AsepFlex Linear Pouch Filler has been developed to solve these problems by improving capacity and operational performance.

Its technology has a capacity as high as 500 ppm (30,000 pouches per hour) and is designed in accordance with FDA guidelines for low acid aseptically filled food products with an operational 95% efficiency rate and reject rate of 0.5%.

The AsepFlex filler can also be technically configured for multi-flavor filling or filling plastic bottles and pouches on the same machine.",JBT AsepFlex Filler to cater for sports and on-the-go drinks
"Using hydrolysis to produce tequila allows Beam Suntory-owned Casa Sauza to save energy, waste less agave and improve the tequila’s flavor. We traveled to the town of Tequila to find out more.",16-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/foodnavigator-latam.com/article/2019/05/16/beam-suntory-casa-sauza-on-sustainable-tequila-production/9481005-3-eng-GB/Beam-Suntory-Casa-Sauza-on-sustainable-tequila-production.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/16/Beam-Suntory-Casa-Sauza-on-sustainable-tequila-production,"Acquired in 2014 by Japanese giant Beam Suntory, one of the largest spirits producers in the world, Casa Sauza claims to be the first tequila producer to use hydrolysis.

According to Casa Sauza’s tequila expert, Luis Alberto Barajas, this step is what makes Casa Sauza’s tequila production more efficient.

“In any other factory, the first thing they do is to put the agave into an autoclave oven and cook the cacti for an average of 30 to 40 hours,” ​he said, speaking to FoodNavigator-LATAM at the company’s hacienda and distillery in Tequila, Jalisco where its tequila is still made.

“But that method is much slower to cook the agave and you also lose a lot of agave​. […] To make one liter of tequila, we use an average of 5 kg of agave while other factories use an average of 10 kilos.”​

Casa Sauza shreds the agave piña​ – the core fruit with leaves removed – in three separate shredding processes. This allows for a more gentle extraction of the sugars contained in the agave fibers, and results in a solution of water and agave sugar.

This agave juice contains complex sugars, such as inulin, that are then transformed into fermentable sugars – fructose and glucose – during the six-hour hydrolysis process.

Hydrolysis also improves the tequila’s flavor, according to Alberto Barajas, because it results in agave juice in liquid form, which ensures a uniform cooking.

Casa Sauza’s tequila, for instance, is defined by notes of fresh agave and herbs thanks to the process, he said.

“On the other hand, if I put whole agave cacti in the oven, parts will be more cooked than others, and in the middle some parts will be raw. That changes the characteristics of the tequila.”​

Once the hydrolysis is complete, the sugars are anaerobically fermented in stainless steel tanks using a proprietary blend of yeasts and nutrients for around 24 hours.

The fermented agave juice is then distilled to remove water and filtered before being aged in casks. The remaining fibers, known as bagasse, are treated to remove acidity and then composted.

Tequila used to be marketed and sold as ‘mezcal wine’ or ‘Mexican whiskey’ but is today recognized as a premium spirit that enjoys protected designated origin status.

This was recently recognized by the European Union​​, which added tequila to the EU register of protected geographical indications (PGI), alongside pisco from Peru and ron from Guatemala.

Around one-quarter of Casa Sauza’s production is for the domestic Mexican market while the rest is exported to over 70 countries around the world. The US is its biggest export market.","Traditional product, modern process: Beam Suntory’s Casa Sauza on how hydrolysis improves tequila’s taste and sustainability"
"‘If there is a poster child product in the proliferation of niche beverage brands, it’s craft beer,’ says Josh Kelly, managing partner, chief strategist, FINE branding agency.",16-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/josh-kelly/9471309-1-eng-GB/Josh-Kelly_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/16/The-Wonkification-of-beverages-creating-a-story-behind-every-sip,"“There’s a lot of debate over what qualifies as ‘craft’. But one thing is clear it is not a judgement about the quality of the liquid. There’s more added-value than ever in the story behind the bottle​,” he said.

Scott Ungermann, brewmaster at San Francisco’s Anchor Brewing, asks the bottom-line question you might ask of any drinkable product: “Did you enjoy the beer while you were drinking it? Would you want another when you’re done?”

“The trick is, a lot of variables influence your experience of a drink​,” added Kelly.

“Making beverage brands is more than upgrading water designing a cheery can, writing a jaunty jingle, and loading up the trucks​.

“Today, a growing consumer segment bases their enjoyment of what they drink on whether they have a true feel for where it’s made, how it’s made, what’s in it, the story behind it, and even how it’s personally served.​”

According to Kelly, in an effort to win the hearts and minds of an increasingly curious consumer, we see a renewed emphasis on inviting people into the source, whether it’s a region, neighborhood, or direct into Willy Wonka’s proverbial chocolate factory itself.

“There’s a heart and soul when you walk around this building​,” said Ungermann.

“If you look at how we make beer - everything done by hand, time-honored traditions, the people - I really believe what we do is the original way of crafting small-batch beer in America, and more specifically, in San Francisco, since the 1800s​.”

That sense of source and place manifests itself in a variety of ways beyond the beer, claims Kelly, from the intimate photography of their copper brew kettles to video origin stories that evoke the Gold Rush, to meticulous drawings of Sausalito label artist Jim Stitt and Anchor’s collaboration with sports teams like the San Francisco Giants and Golden State Warriors.

All these details draw you closer to Anchor’s sphere; its city and brewery even when you can’t get a reservation.

“We’re trying to express our sense of time and place in whiskey​,” said Steve Hawley, director of marketing, Westland Distillery and principal at 51 Eggs Branding, in Seattle, Washington.

“In a way, we are introducing a new category of whiskey into a 600-year-old industry​.”

With an identity and labels that evoke Pacific Northwest industry, a video anthem that celebrates its context with visual immersion and poetic narration, and a pioneering ‘Our West is Whiskey’ message, Westland’s brand takes pains to ground consumers in a place that hasn’t traditionally been associated with whiskey, creating meaningful difference in an industry where even the varieties of oak used in barrels have historically been limited.

“If you can’t visit a distillery or winery, a digital destination may be the best place to get a depth of content, functionality, and imagery that mimics the experience​,” said Kelly.

“The design for Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars’ online destination was inspired by a new offline visitor’s center. For Ashes & Diamonds, the same millennial community drawn to their winery on famed HWY 29 gathers around the modern, streamlined experience where the brand lives online​.”

According to Kenn Fine, executive creator, FINE, some of the most interesting studies around wine show how much perception influences reality.

“Most people won’t develop the expertise to distinguish nuances of taste, so you have to connect them to an experience​,” he said.

“These emotional connections contextualize the image consumers get when they drink​.”","The ‘Wonkification’ of beverages, creating a story behind every sip"

Zolesse can be used in low doses, with average usage levels in beverages, cereals, hard candies, and baked goods at 30 parts per million (ppm), 50 ppm for milk products and 10 ppm for soups, according to the companies.

Certified non-GMO, it also modifies the taste of other stevia ingredients, reducing bitterness and lingering flavor. It also blends well with monk fruit and sugar if manufacturers want to increase sweetness, the companies said.

“It eases the concern of formulators who believe consumers may be sensitive to stevia products when reading ‘steviol glycosides’ or ‘stevia extracts’ on the label. Plus, Zolesse creates no application hurdle, since it has a negligible effect on the original taste of the products,"" ​Jackson added.

Sugar reduction in food and drink products is an increasingly important issue across Latin America where rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes rise and governments introduce measures to restrict sugar intake, such as Mexico’s sugar taxes or front-of-pack warning labels in Chile, Peru and Uruguay.

Senior vice president of food and beverage at Tate & Lyle and general manager of the Latin American division, Oswaldo Nardinelli, recently told this publication​​, stevia was its “number one priority ingredient​” for sugar reduction in the region, followed by allulose and fiber.

Zolesse is also available in the US, the Philippines, Indonesia and all countries that accept flavors deemed by the US Flavor and Extract Manufacturers’ Association (FEMA) to be Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS).

Other Latin American countries that accept FEMA GRAS flavors include Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Paraguay, and Uruguay, although some countries may require product registration.","Label-friendly, ‘natural flavor’ stevia launched in Brazil and Mexico"
"The Coffee Cherry Co. is paying coffee farmers for their cherry by-product and transforming it into a gluten-free, high fibre, antioxidant-rich food ingredient, CEO Tom Clemente tells FoodNavigator.",20-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/ceo-tom-clemente-stands-in-front-of-a-mound-of-discarded-coffee-cherries-in-colombia-c-the-coffee-cherry-co/9482947-1-eng-GB/CEO-Tom-Clemente-stands-in-front-of-a-mound-of-discarded-coffee-cherries-in-Colombia-C-The-Coffee-Cherry-Co_medium.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/20/Upcycling-coffee-cherries-for-food-Every-major-chocolate-company-is-looking-at-this,"The Coffee Cherry Co. – formerly known as Coffee Flour – is working to create value for farmers’ discarded coffee cherry pulp in origin countries.

Coffee trees traditionally grow between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, with main coffee growing nations including Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, and Honduras. To harvest the coffee bean, the seed is removed from the cherry fruit, with the pulp by-product rejected as waste.

Former Starbucks engineer Dan Belliveau founded The Coffee Cherry Co. having seen first-hand the fields of rotting cherries discarded in the coffee making process.

“If you don’t handle the cherry right away, it will mould and ferment and become dangerous [for consumption],” ​according to CEO Tom Clemente. To give value to this by-product, The Coffee Cherry Co. buys the pulp from farmers, dries it, mills it, and sells the upcycled ingredient for use in bakery, beverage, and confectionery applications.

While currently focusing on the US and Asian markets, the Seattle-headquartered firm is preparing to launch in Europe, Clemente told FoodNavigator when we caught up at Seeds and Chips in Milan last week.

Indeed, an EU novel food patent application has already been submitted for coffee cherry – the generic name of ‘cascara’ – he explained. “We are talking with folks [in Europe] and are getting prepared, because we believe the novel food patent application will be approved this year.”​

From a sustainability perspective, the statistics behind discarded coffee cherry are alarming. The global coffee industry generates 20.8 billion kg of coffee cherry waste per year, and this waste is responsible for the equivalent of 16.6 million metric tonnes of CO2e, according to The Coffee Cherry Co.

In addition, rotting coffee cherry waste ends up in fields and waterways, where it can release harmful mycotoxins into the water and soil.

Not only by removing the decaying fruit from the fields are less greenhouse gases emitted, but the side-stream production creates new jobs at coffee processing meals – many of which are now available to women.

“Normally, farmers have people take care of the beans, but not the cherries. A sack of coffee beans may weigh 50 lbs., yet a sack of cherry pulp may weight just 20 lbs.,” ​Clemente explained, suggesting that women can transport the lighter load.

While some farmers do find use for the discarded pulp, the CEO raised concerns that the cherry’s chemical composition is unsuitable for agricultural applications.

Certain landowners, for example, use the discarded pulp for animal feed, which he said is problematic for two reasons. Firstly, the cherry contains chemicals that act as an appetite suppressant: “When you are fattening cattle, do you want to make them feel full?”​ he added.

Secondly, unless processed immediately, the cherry pulp rots – becoming unsafe to consume. “You can’t feed rotten cherries to animals to animals, so you have to process it. By the time you do that, it is more expensive than other feed options.”​

The pulp can also be used as a fertiliser when mixed with compost, yet its phytochemical count will kill the worms working to break down the matter, the CEO told us. Diluting it with other materials will lessen this effect, but means that “maybe 5-10% really gets used, and the balance rots in the field”.​

The milled cherry flour is gluten-free and contains more fibre per gram than wholegrain wheat fibre. According to the firm, per gram the product has more antioxidants than a pomegranate, less fat and more fibre than coconut flour, more iron than fresh spinach, more potassium than a banana, and more protein than fresh kale.

Clemente said manufacturers can also use the coffee cherry product to reduce the amount of sugar in finished products.

“We call this ‘stealth health’,” ​said the CEO. Using a chocolate brownie as an example, he told us the coffee cherry can also reduce the amount of cocoa powder required. “The coffee cherry is like an emulator of flavour, it highlights the cocoa notes, so you don’t need as much cocoa powder to get [the same] flavour.​

“Secondly, the coffee cherry is naturally sweet. Chocolate is a bit bitter. The cherries can [replace the sugar] to mask the bitterness. Now the customer is eating a brownie will less cocoa, less sugar, but more magnesium, fibre and potassium.”​

The Coffee Cherry Co. has also developed a benchtop compound chocolate product using the coffee cherry. The coffee cherry and cacao are combined ahead of the conching process, which similarly allows for reduced sugar content. “If you have a 65% chocolate it will taste like 75%,” ​said Clemente.

US-based Seattle Chocolates has incorporated the coffee cherry into its ‘Coffee Fruit & Espresso’ bars and truffle products, albeit as an inclusion. “What we’re looking for is chocolate makers to do it at the beginning of the chocolate making process.”​

American coffeehouse chain Starbucks has also expressed interest in The Coffee Cherry Co.’s upcycled offerings, alongside a number of beverage, bakery, and confectionery manufacturers. “Every major chocolate company is looking at this,” ​Clemente told FoodNavigator.

Further, upcycled coffee cherry can be used to enhance traditional ground coffee. Hawaiian coffee brand Lion Coffee has incorporated The Coffee Cherry Co.’s product into its ‘Antioxidant French Roast’ range. This application comes with the added benefit for manufacturers of not having to declare extra ingredients in the final product. “It can be labelled 100% Arabica coffee, because it is [all coffee].”​",Upcycling coffee cherries for food: 'Every major chocolate company is looking at this'

"Taste sensitivity could be an untapped sector for beverages like wine and coffee, according to new research from Cornell University. Supertasters and nontasters respond differently to sensory information, with potential for new marketing strategies.",20-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/publications/food-beverage-nutrition/beveragedaily.com/news/r-d/should-brands-be-marketing-to-supertasters/9474508-1-eng-GB/Should-brands-be-marketing-to-supertasters_wrbm_large.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/20/Should-brands-be-marketing-to-supertasters,"Professors at Cornell conducted an interactive tasting presentation in February in conjunction with their taste physiology research. They wanted to “determine the role of a specific inheritable trait—sensitivity to bitterness—on shaping consumer preference, taste preference, and behavior.”

They believe this affects both segmentation and marketing strategies, and it’s important for beverage brands to learn more about it because the majority of advertising research is based on the ‘nurture’ view of the nature vs nurture debate.

Kathy LaTour, Miguel Gomez, Michael LaTour and Brian Wansink were all involved in the research that examined consumer taste preferences in coffee, soda and wine.

“Segmentation of consumers by taste sensitivity can explain differences in cola and wine taste tests that cannot be explained by training or cultural influence. Supertasters are more sensitive to bitterness, seek sweeter foods, and exhibit more behavioral loyalty than other consumers, which makes them an important segment for food marketers involved in testing and introducing new products,”​ they said.

According to the researchers, product sensory tasting information and printed tasting descriptions are the most common strategies used for promoting products. By better understanding their consumers, companies can capitalize on their preferences.

In the interactive presentation, LaTour and Gomez had participants draw a strip of paper coated with tastant propylthiouracil (PROP) and taste them for 30 seconds. About one-quarter of the audience thought the taste was ‘terrible and bitter’ and are categorized as supertasters. Another quarter said they tasted nothing and are considered nontasters.

They found that the supertasters prefer sweet wine, but will end up buying tannic red wine because they believe it is a better product. The same was found true in coffee--supertasters don’t like the taste of bitter coffee, but they will buy darker brews because they are popular and trendy, and often regarded as higher quality.

“Your social aspirations have more weight than you realize,”​ Gomez said.

So while taste physiology matters for consumer drink preferences, LaTour and Gomez determined that product knowledge is even more important. Supertasters also tend to be negatively influenced by the word ‘sweet’ and positively influenced by the word ‘dry.’

The coffee results suggest that having sensory information listed on labels can positively influence supertasters’ purchase likelihood for black coffee, even though it’s a product that they tend not to enjoy and to consume less.

Because product loyalty is a strong trait among supertasters, the researchers think that advertisers can attract them by using language that emphasizes the ‘sweetness or mellowness’ of a product in a positive way.

LaTour and Gomez partnered with wineries in the Finger Lakes of New York to analyze consumer purchasing behavior and run simple experiments. They believe that wine tasting rooms would benefit from thinking about new marketing strategies using this information.

Asking visitors questions about their tastes outside of wine, like preferences for dark chocolate or dark coffee, could help them make better recommendations and plan future innovations.",Should brands be marketing to ‘supertasters’?
"PepsiCo has patented a process to co-ferment oats and dairy milk, creating a drinkable or spoonable product with ""unique"" metabolites and a versatile taste profile.",20-May-2019,https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/media/images/oat-flakes-close-up-xamtiw/9493599-1-eng-GB/oat-flakes-close-up-xamtiw_reference.jpg,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2019/05/20/PepsiCo-patents-co-fermented-oat-and-dairy-product-with-unique-nutritional-profile,"Filed through PepsiCo-owned Quaker Oats Company, the patent describes a method for manufacturing a clean-label drinkable or spoonable dairy product made by co-fermenting oats and dairy.

There are some food products already on the market that blend both ingredients, both in an unfermented state and fermented state.

According to PepsiCo, however, what makes its patented product unique is the fact the milk and oats are fermented together, allowing the bacterial culture to act on both the dairy and grain simultaneously.

“[This] is believed to provide unique metabolites that cannot be produced by the separate or sequential fermentation of dairy and grains,” ​the patent reads.

These unique metabolites can include short-chain fatty acids, phenolic compounds, intact proteins, peptides, exopolysaccharides, oat fiber and glucans with a desirable prebiotic effect, and volatile flavors.

They also differ from the metabolites formed when mixing fermented oats with fermented dairy because the cultures typically used to ferment the two substrates are different.

The resulting product also has “desirable organoleptic properties​”, write the R&D scientists.

After combining the unfermented grain and dairy, the mixture is heated, inoculated with the live cultures, left to ferment, mixed, and homogenized.

According to PepsiCo, the various textures – from spoonable to drinkable – can be achieved thanks to the “unique processing steps​” rather than by using additives or texturants, which may change the product’s taste.

The co-fermented yogurt can then be flavored with numerous ingredients, such as flavorings, fruit, cereal or grain pieces, nuts and seeds, and vegetable purees or vegetable pieces.

The co-fermented product may be sold as a fresh, chilled food product, in which case it has a refrigerated shelf-life of around 28 days, or as a shelf-stable, ambient food product with a shelf-life of between four and 12 months.

Using regular oat flour provides a sweeter, dairy yogurt flavor profile while a high-protein oat flour results in a “slightly savory​” yogurt flavor with lower viscosity.

Other grains that have a similar carbohydrate and fat profile to oats, such as sorghum, buckwheat or barley, could also be used.

The product could allow PepsiCo to tap into growing interest for fermented foods, such as kefir and kombucha. ""Recent trends show a desire to purchase and consume fermented food products​,"" it says in the patent. ""Fermentation is a process that uses bacteria to break down carbohydrates of food into simpler metabolites, which is believed to increase the digestibility and absorption of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.​ The patent identifies a number of cultures that can be used to kickstart the co-fermentation process, such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii​ subsp. lactis​, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Streptococcus thermophiles, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus lactis subsp. Cremoris ​and Lactococcus lactis ​subsp. lactis​ biovar diacetylactis. The metabolites produced during fermentation depend on a number of factors, such as the base food ingredient used, the culture and fermentation conditions, according to the patent.

Health and wellness are increasingly important to Latin American consumers, and leveraging the Quaker Oats brand is one way PepsiCo intends to meet their demands.

“Consumers are becoming more aware of their eating habits and taking a more conscious approach on health,”​ Alina Hernández Aguilar, corporate affairs director at PepsiCo Mexico, previously told this publication.​​

Speaking about the Mexican market specifically, she added: “The Quaker brand is a key player in our nutrition portfolio; it is one of our strongest bets to keep growing in this market, so we are highly confident that we can tap into it.”​

PepsiCo opened an R&D center for bakery products in Apodaca, Mexico in 2014, and has since launched a number of Quaker products for the international market, such as ‘Good Start Cookies’ for Dubai and ‘Biscuit Bites’ for China.

It also has a number of oat-based products specifically for the Latin American market in the pipeline.

""In Latin America, we are innovating with Quaker superfoods, a new premium platform with differentiated ingredients such as oats with rye, amaranth, flaxseed, and quinoa,""​ the company said recently in an investors' call. ​​

In 2017, Latin America accounted for 11% of the soda-to-snacks manufacturer’s total US$63.5bn net revenue.

Before entering the cannabis industry, Dooma Wendschuh had his own company in the video gaming sector, working on projects such as Assassin’s Creed franchise. But five years ago he decided there was a real opportunity for cannabis and started working in the industry, launching Province Brands in 2016.

'We went to master brewers and very naively said, 'hey, we want to brew a beer from cannabis!''

Province Brands’ main project for 2019 is to launch beer brewed from the cannabis plant, including the stocks, stems and roots.

It's something that has taken years to develop from the initial prototypes - ‘which tasted like rotten broccoli and would have cost $60 a bottle’.

It’s a project that has taken a lot of work with the technology; and a huge amount of funding.

Raising capital has been surprisingly easy, says Wendschuh – he has found plenty of supporters of cannabis legalization who ‘want to see the world change’ – but reflects that developing the technology has been a long journey.

“From the science side, this was a really bad idea - it's amazing it's actually worked. When we started this company, I didn’t know how to brew a beer, we met with master brewers and very naively said, 'hey, we want to brew a beer from cannabis!'​

“People said it was completely impossible, we did not listen, we figured there must be a way. We spent an insane amount of money and hired some of the top researchers in the world and we were very fortunate to find people who were prepared to make this their life’s work”​

The resulting beer combines the flavor of hops, flavor of beer, and complex flavor of cannabis, says Wendschuh. Without barley and grains, there is a lot less residual sugar which makes it less sweet and lower in calories than an average beer (around 40 calories).

Beers will contain 6.5mg THC, and different levels of CBD between different products.

But there is a still a lot for the company to do - such as scaling up technology to embrace economies of scale – as well as embracing the future of the technology (having succeeded in brewing from cannabis, Wendschuh says the possibilities to experiment with other plants is vast).

But more pressingly the company is trying to anticipate what Canada’s cannabis beverage industry will look like when products become legal (anticipated for this fall).

“You’re setting sail in a ship that is totally not built yet; you have a bunch of carpenters on the ship trying to lay the planks and build the boat - but you just have to go; and you’re going to build that ship as you go; but you don’t know where you’re going!""​ said Wendshuh. ""You don’t know what the conditions are at sea, it is really, really an insane thing to do. ​

“We don’t have any guidelines from Canada as to what the actual regulations will be – they released some draft regulations,​​ but we expect those to change. We have to make purchasing decisions that may end up wasting money. We’re buying packaging that we just hope will be compliant. We don’t even know, technically, if our beer will be legal.​

“This is the great unknown: You need really good lawyers, and you need to be prepared to fight for what think is right and you believe in, and you need to just go into this knowing that nothing is going to be easy. You have to be incredibly resilient. ​

“We are, for better or for worse, the icebreaker.”​
