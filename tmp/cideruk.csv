Richard Morgan-Jones, a Herefordshire based apple grower, has been given a special award and praised by Thatchers Cider for the exceptional quality of apples he produces.

Richard, who has followed in his father’s footsteps in growing and supplying apples to Thatchers, was presented with the Thatchers Apple Grower of the Year award at the cidermaker’s annual Wassail celebrations.

Richard supplies seven different apple varieties to Thatchers, both bittersweet and dessert – from Katy early in the season, through to Yarlington Mill as one of the last to be harvested.

Richard Johnson, chief cidermaker at Thatchers says, “Richard has put in an enormous amount of effort throughout the growing and harvest season to ensure his apples are the highest quality. In fact, this last harvest he supplied us with 101 trailer loads of fruit, which were all fantastic quality from September through to November. That is a real achievement over such a large harvest.

“Richard’s dedication to quality matches our own and truly reflects our ethos that the best cider starts in the orchard.”

Thatchers presents the award each year to recognise the commitment to quality that the growers have demonstrated when supplying fruit into the Thatchers cider mill.

Thatchers has over 500 acres of its own orchard in and around its cider mill at Myrtle Farm in Somerset, as well as a number of growers throughout the West Country.

“Climate and soil – as well as the expertise of the grower – all play their part in producing top quality apples for cidermaking,” continues Richard Johnson. “As a cidermaker we have our favourite apple varieties to suit our own style of ciders – Richard Morgan-Jones supplies us with Katy, which is pressed into our single variety cider of the same name; newer apple varieties such as Gilly and Jane, and much-loved bittersweet varieties Dabinett and Yarlington Mill.

“We test every batch of apples for quality that arrive at Myrtle Farm during harvest and reward our growers accordingly. This year Richard Morgan-Jones excelled, and we are very happy that he’s our Apple Grower of the Year.”",THATCHERS APPLE GROWER OF THE YEAR IS RICHARD MORGAN-JONES

Gordon outlined how collaboration across the industry by cider makers of all scales is a positive feature, though the hard-pressed sector still needs support from government.

As a relatively small industry, representing the best interests of every cider maker informs all aspects of activity of the NACM. The vision of the association is that all producers can operate successfully and fairly in a competitive market, whilst continuing to support their communities, employees and apple growers.

To enable this, he called for a balanced regulatory environment for cider makers reflecting the unique circumstances of producers. In particular, MPs, Ministers and officials were urged to deliver a consistent application of regulations.

Gordon challenged the Government’s willingness to understand the specific situations of cider makers. While headlines from the Autumn budget stated that cider duty was frozen, ciders in the middle duty band received a 25% tax increase, impacting many small cider makers.

Following his speech, Gordon commented: “Cider businesses of all sizes are working hard to deliver a sustainable future for the benefit of consumers and the rural environment. The industry is a significant part of British heritage.

“We need the support of politicians to work with us to return cider to more positive results, remove red tape and the unnecessary rules that limit innovation and investment. This support can enable cider makers produce fantastic products that interest in our category.

“We work to see every cider maker flourish and grow in line with their ambitions, whilst maintaining the highest standards. We firmly believe that with our collaborative nature and how we support one another this can be achieved when we can rely on consistent and sensible legislation.

“In recent months we have seen members providing orcharding experts when others experience weather related problems, large companies have supported smaller producers to expand their packaging ranges. When something is challenging or if advice is needed, small producers will always be supported, and to me, this is why the UK cider industry is so very special.”

The Parliamentary Cider Group Reception was an opportunity to showcase the best of British cider, which is home to the largest cider market in the world. The evening was attended by cider makers from across the South West, Midlands and further afield, as well as many MPs that represent cider making regions within their constituencies.

Expected to be seen over 30 million times in live rugby during the first two months of the campaign alone, and in total seen by ¾ of the adult population, the TV commercial’s message to viewers is that Thatchers is totally uncompromising about the quality of its cider – if something’s not perfect, it’s useless. You wouldn’t settle for a race car that could almost race – so why buy a cider that’s almost perfect, reinforcing the link between quality and perfection of Thatchers.

The 30 second Race Car commercial will be first seen on ITV during the Six Nations Rugby England Vs Ireland match on 2nd February at half time. It will then be shown from February through to September on ITV, Channel 4 and Multichannel, during this year’s top sporting events and TV moments. Hero spots will include Six Nations Rugby, The Grand National, Monaco Grand Prix, Cricket World Cup, Game of Thrones, Great British Bake Off, and the Women’s Football World Cup.

The ad will be included in a VOD (video on demand) campaign running April to July, and also runs in cinema during July and August, including the silver spot in the hotly anticipated new Quentin Tarantino Film – Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, starring amongst others Brad Pitt, Leonardo di Caprio and Margot Robbie.

Yvonne Flannery, Head of Brands at Thatchers Cider comments, “This new phase of our award-winning campaign features our popular Spokesperson, as well as cameos from Martin Thatcher and our chief cidermaker Richard Johnson. Filmed in iconic West Country locations, it retains a gentle, warm-hearted yet funny tone, and leaves the viewer with no doubt as to the taste and quality of Thatchers ciders – what cider’s supposed to taste like.

“Following from our Hot Air Balloon commercial, which we know resonated strongly with viewers on enjoyment and memorability*, Race Car creates a long-term campaign for Thatchers, filmed in the same, sunny photographic style, and featuring familiar faces, music and scenery to support brand recognition.

“Of course, the notion that the race car is going so slow is clearly ridiculous, as was the low flying hot air balloon in the first of the ad series. This is a humorous ad that will appeal to a wide audience and introduce new customers to our brand.”

Joint London are the creative agency behind the campaign for Thatchers, with Bray Leino advising on media buying. The film was directed by Declan Lowney, who has shot numerous commercials for some of the world’s biggest brands. He is also a top television comedy director, with Father Ted, Little Britain and Moone Boy amongst his credits.

The TV campaign is accompanied by a new series of short films for digital channels, also featuring the Thatchers’ Spokesperson, who finds himself in humorous situations at Thatchers Myrtle Farm, always highlighting the Thatchers family of ciders and their great taste characteristics – Thatchers Gold, Haze, Vintage and Katy.

2019 will be another important year for the growth of the Thatchers brand, with planned marketing activity including experiential, sponsorships, events and festivals. The family-run Somerset cidermaker is continually supporting and growing its brands to help drive people into the cider category, and is one of the biggest investors in marketing amongst UK cidermakers.

With its focus on apple cider, Thatchers is driving the apple cider category across both on and off trades with its Gold and Haze ciders. Thatchers Gold is the no 2 canned apple cider (by value)* in the off trade and Thatchers Haze is the No 1 cloudy cider. In the on trade Thatchers Haze is the fastest growing cider in the top ten draught ciders**, and Gold has the best rate of sale of all draught apple ciders.

The Award was presented to Stonegate CEO, Simon Longbottom, at the annual APPBG Dinner in Westminster, in recognition of the company’s impressive commitment to charity support across its pubs and head office. Stonegate raises around £1.5 million for charity every year, supporting a wide range of worthy national and local causes.

Co-founder of PubAid, Des O’Flanagan said, “Everyone on the PubAid Steering Group was impressed by Stonegate’s support for charity. Fundraising is seen not as a ‘nice to do’ add-on, but a fundamental part of running a Stonegate pub.

“Managers and their teams demonstrate huge creativity and dedication in their fundraising, which embraces a variety of activities, from Fun Days to fancy dress events, sporting challenges and larger, region-wide initiatives, such as the ‘Spartan Walk’, where 300 southern pubs raised £73,500 for Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospice. Head office are also active within their community in Luton, with ongoing support for the local children’s hospital.”

PubAid also highlighted Stonegate’s northern division’s mission to raise £60,000 for MIND and the Scottish Association for Mental Health. A whopping £45,000 has already been raised by the pubs and bars with a further £9,000 raised by the management and support team who trekked the gruelling Three Peaks. Fundraising continues until September so they are on track to hit the target.

On receiving the award Longbottom said, “It is an honour to receive this award in recognition of the tremendous amount of community fundraising and the phenomenal amount of money raised each year for charities large and small by our pubs and support team.”

Mike Wood, MP for Dudley South and Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, said “Stonegate has shown what can be achieved when charity support is embedded within a company’s culture, with all employees empowered and enthused to do their bit to help. Raising £1.5 million a year is a fantastic result and we are delighted to name them as the winner of our Corporate Charity Fundraiser award.”

As well as the Corporate Charity Fundraiser of the Year award, PubAid also recognises outstanding charity support by individual pubs with the Charity Fundraising Pub of the Year award. This award, supported by Magners, was presented for the first time earlier this year, with the Logan Rock in Treen, Cornwall, taking the winner’s title ahead of seven other pubs on a very strong shortlist.

The Corporate Charity Fundraiser award is in its fourth year. Previous winners are JD Wetherspoon, Greene King and Joseph Holt.

The four-year agreement between Magners Irish Cider and Jockey Club Racecourses will see the first ‘Magners Cheltenham Gold Cup’ on Friday, 15 March 2019, the feature race on the final day of Jump racing’s showpiece event.

In addition, the agreement, which will run until 2022, will also see Magners Irish Cider become the Presenting Partner across all four days of The FestivalTM, which will be recognised as ‘The FestivalTM, presented by Magners’.

Today’s announcement represents the first major horse racing sponsorship by Magners, which is produced in Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland and is part of Dublin-headquartered C&C Group plc.

The partnership between Jockey Club Racecourses and Magners Irish Cider, celebrates the brand’s Irish heritage by associating with the leading British and Irish-attended event in the UK, attracting crowds of over 260,000 annually, and watched by millions of horse racing fans across the world via TV and digital platforms.

The FestivalTM is the fourth biggest sporting event in the UK, in terms of the total number of visitors, and takes place over four days at the world famous Prestbury Park racecourse in Gloucestershire. In addition, The FestivalTM has broad and increasing appeal in Ireland, with approximately one third of tickets sold in 2018 going to Irish race-goers. The FestivalTM 2018 was another fruitful year for the Irish, with punters witnessing 17 Irish-trained winners during four days of competitive Jump racing.

From 2019 to 2022, this agreement means Jump racing’s showpiece event will become the ‘Magners Cheltenham Gold Cup’. The FestivalTM will now be referred to as ‘The FestivalTM, presented by Magners’.

The Cheltenham Gold Cup has a long and illustrious history and takes place at level weights over three and a quarter miles and 22 fences. Its victory roll features the finest staying chasers ever to grace the turf, including Arkle, Best Mate, Golden Miller, Kauto Star and Mill House. 2018 saw an epic renewal, with Native River seeing off the challenge of Might Bite in a thrilling championship contest.

Jason Ash, Chief Marketing Officer of C&C Group plc, said: “Magners Cider is 100% Irish, made in Clonmel, County Tipperary, where William Magner first started making cider over 80 years ago. Famous for our Irish heritage, sociability and positive view on life we are truly excited to put our name to the most prestigious Jump race in Europe and partner with one of the UK’s best sporting and social occasions as a platform to engage fans and bring Magners to a global audience.

Given The FestivalTM is a major occasion in the sporting calendar of racing fans across the world, especially in the UK and Ireland, we are delighted to be a part of such an iconic event. We see our partnership with The FestivalTM and the Magners Cheltenham Gold Cup as a perfect fit, providing a year-round platform to bring to life our new “100% Irish” positioning to consumers in the UK and internationally.

We look forward to working with The Jockey Club to engage horse racing fans across multiple platforms, including at The FestivalTM, in the On and Off-trades, and via advertising, digital and social activation”.

Ian Renton, Cheltenham and South West Regional Director for Jockey Club Racecourses, said: “To work with Magners over the next four years is something our whole team is hugely looking forward to. I believe this partnership with a brand of provenance and heritage like Magners will provide a big opportunity for both parties.

In the build-up to The FestivalTM each year, a third of the tickets purchased are by Irish race-goers, so we feel this partnership is a great fit and we’re delighted to be working alongside a partner with such a strong Irish heritage and appeal in the UK, Ireland and beyond.

As well as looking forward to staging the first Magners Cheltenham Gold Cup, 2019 will be the first time The FestivalTM has had a Presenting Partner to promote the whole event to an even wider audience.”",MAGNERS UNVEILED AS EXCLUSIVE SPONSOR OF CHELTENHAM GOLD CUP

Addressing members of the NACM and attendees at the All Party Parliamentary Cider Group (APPCG) on Tuesday 11 September, Gordon outlined his vision to ensure a sustainable future for producers, whatever their scale.

He called for a fair and balanced regulatory environment for cider makers to operate in and asked for the support from MPs, Ministers and officials to back the UK industry – home to the largest cider market in the world.

Gordon promoted the need for a collaborative approach and all involved to give the industry the best opportunity to flourish.

Speaking about becoming chair, Gordon commented: “I’ve enjoyed a significant amount of my career in the cider industry and a great part of my life living in the cider heartland, so I am relishing the opportunity to lead the industry.

“No matter the size of the cider maker, everyone is committed to apples and agriculture – that is the most important message I want to get across. The industry is facing a number of complex challenges, but through a united approach we can certainly deliver a future that is innovative and sustainable.

“We need an excise duty structure that allows producers to grow, a robust examination of evidence in all policy issues and of course, cider makers to have the common goal to celebrate this diverse industry that provides for ever consumer and occasion – here in the UK and across the world.”

Fenella Tyler, the chief executive of the NACM, spoke about the appointment: “Gordon has been the deputy chair for two years and has already made a significant contribution. We expect he will continue to do great work to advance the interests of all cider markets for the benefit of all cider drinkers.”

The new duty band for mid-strength cider will come into effect from 1st February 2019 and the new duty rate for ciders between 6.9% and 7.5% ABV will be announced on 29th October. The increase in excise duty that this brings will negatively impact nearly all cider makers, with the inadvertent consequences felt most by smaller cider makers.

In their submission to the Treasury ahead of the Autumn Budget, the NACM has asked for special consideration to be given to cider. Gordon Johncox, chair of the NACM explains “Cider has been in decline since 2009 and the impacts are being felt across the industry and the cider supply chain. Apple contracts in the South West, Herefordshire and other cider making regions are ending as the cider industry requirement for apples falls.” The standard cider category is now 25% smaller than it was 9 years ago, resulting in fewer apples needed to meet consumer demand. In the same period changes to excise duty have resulted in the tax on cider moving closer to other categories.

“We need a 2p per pint reduction in excise duty for standard cider, which will help return the standard cider category to growth, but also give a much needed boost to the smaller cider makers who are impacted by the new duty band. Most cider makers will make ciders in both the standard and the mid-strength duty band, so this reduction would help soften the blow when the new duty rate comes in next February.” Gordon explains. “The case for more support for small cider makers is growing day by day. We are asking the Treasury to introduce a progressive cider duty that would support small cider makers to grow, innovate and create more jobs. However, we ask that they consider how best this can be achieved whilst continuing to protect the smallest cider makers who currently benefit from the 70Hl duty relief”.

The NACM has explained to the Treasury that the current concerns around post Brexit impacts on the cider industry, continue to create more uncertainty for the industry, especially around export and supply chain issues. Uncertainty about the tax increase that will be announced on 29th October for the new duty band has added to industry uncertainty. Cider makers create rural jobs, invest in their communities and encourage over half a million tourists to visit each year. Gordon concludes “Cider really is a Great British success story and we ask that it is given more support to encourage growth, innovation and success. We hope that we will be raising a glass of cider to the Chancellor next Monday”.",FAIRER TREATMENT FOR CIDER CALL AHEAD OF THE AUTUMN BUDGET

The Thatchers Young Talent Programme is in its first full year and has just seen 17 apprentices and graduates start work with the Somerset-based cidermaker. Thatchers is delivering high-quality, inspirational work experience and development opportunities, preparing people for work in this world-class industry. IGD is a national research and training charity at the heart of the food and grocery industry.

Martin Thatcher, fourth generation cidermaker at Thatchers says, “It is a real honour to be recognised by IGD with this award for our Young Talent Programme. Over recent years we have found that knowledge about careers within the food and drink sector hasn’t met our needs as an emerging business, so we wanted to create our own apprenticeship programme to attract the best people and invest in training and development.”

Emma Cox, training coordinator at Thatchers adds, “We started from a blank sheet of paper, and in just twelve months by working with local schools, colleges and universities we have developed and compiled an apprenticeship and graduate programme that is tailored to the needs of our industry, not only helping young people start on their career path, but importantly developing the skilled workforce that as a growing company we need at Thatchers.”

Fiona Miller, Head of Employability and Skills at IGD, said: “Already reaching over 10,000 young people, we were blown away by the results Thatchers is achieving after just 12 months of its Young Talent programme. The Thatchers team has a strong understanding of the education landscape and has developed a long-term strategy and comprehensive programme that puts the needs of young people at its heart. They run engaging activities for school and university students, and work collaboratively with teachers and parents, to empower young people to make informed decisions about their future. It’s great to see that the young talent pipeline is already building as a result, and that they work closely with other business in the region to share best practice.”

UK cider makers are under tremendous pressure and whilst we had asked for a reduction in duty, we are pleased that he has listened to our concerns and ensured that the current level of decline does not deteriorate further. The new duty rate for the mid-strength duty band, for ciders between 6.9% and 7.5% ABV of £50.71, introduced from 1st February 2019, will result in an increase of more than 10p per litre bottle. An increase that will impact a large number of cider makers across the UK of all sizes and something that they are disappointed about. Gordon Johncox, chair of the National Association of Cider Makers commented “Great British ciders are a part of rural tradition in many parts of the UK and by freezing cider duty today, the Chancellor has given support to our great industry. Whilst the Chancellor has been very fair in freezing cider duty, we are still concerned for those cider makers inadvertently impacted by the new mid-strength duty band.”",CIDER DUTY FROZEN IN THE BUDGET

The neglected, surplus fruit is donated and collected from London’s gardens, orchards and parks where it would otherwise be left to rot, making the cider a unique London brew; 100% local with no air miles and a very minimal carbon footprint. Its consumers can also feel good about supporting a food waste reduction initiative, while enjoying a different taste with every harvest (the varieties of apples used in each batch vary depending on which fruit is donated). The project has even started to source its fruit from commercial supply chains and hopes to explore this avenue further, – a win-win for conscious businesses and cider fans alike!

An army of dedicated volunteers powers the Community Cider Hub under the direction of two part-time female cider makers from The Orchard Project. Nearly 700 volunteers have been trained in harvesting, pressing and bottling the since its inception in 2016, making this a true community effort. The charity ensures that each person leaves with an increased awareness of food waste issues and a free bottle of Local Fox Cider of course. Every part of the process, from scratting and pressing to bottling and labelling, is conducted handcrafted, using traditional methods to preserve our cider heritage.
• Over 15 tonnes of fruit transformed into beverages since 2016.
• Approximately 15,000 bottles of cider and juice produced since 2016.
• Individuals and community orchards who donate fruit are given cider, tools or training on fruit tree care in return.

While this unique, food waste-reducing craft cider movement continues to bloom, its funding is sadly coming to an end. The Orchard Project has launched a Crowdfunding campaign to save the Community Cider Hub and ensure it continues to thrive and grow. The campaign is live from 7th November until 10th December 2018. With a target of £17,500 to raise, the charity is urging people to spread the word and support the campaign at www.crowdfunder.co.uk/localfox. Those who pledge can bag some exciting rewards, from cider gift boxes and signed cider books, to fruit tree pruning and grafting workshops and exclusive artwork.

Taking to the court from April, the partnership with the LTA will drive further awareness and trial of Mortimer’s Orchard amongst tens of thousands of tennis fans at tournaments throughout the summer.

It will also feature the launch of the inaugural Mortimer’s Orchard Cider Bar at the Fever-Tree Championships, where tournament-goers will be able to enjoy the brand’s Original and English Berry offerings, both of which provide lasting refreshment with a light, sparkling finish.

“Summer sports and a cold pint of cider go hand-in-hand and, as such a well-established symbol of British summer time, the LTA is a clear fit with the Mortimer’s Orchard brand.

The Wassail is a traditional ceremony that sees apple trees blessed with cider and awoken from their winter slumber, ensuring a good harvest for the year ahead. Led by The Green Man and the Mendip Morrismen, the weird and wonderful celebrations include hanging cider-soaked toast in the branches of the Wassail tree, pouring cider onto the tree’s roots, and firing shotguns into the upper branches to scare away the evil spirits. That’s accompanied by singing, dancing and of course, mulled cider.

Martin Thatcher, fourth generation of the Somerset cidermaking family, is keen to keep traditions such as Wassailing alive, he says, “The Wassail is a great tradition which reminds us that orchards and cider have been a part of West Country life for hundreds of years.

“Despite the rain, everyone had a fun-filled evening, and warmed up with a delicious supper in the Railway Inn to round off the celebrations.”",WASSAILING WITH THATCHERS CIDER

The new Raspberry and Cucumber flavoured cider also taps into the huge growth of berry-flavoured ciders, which now account for 87% of all fruit ciders sold*.

The Raspberry and Cucumber flavoured Rosie’s Pig Raspberry Roller Cloudy Cider joins existing Rosie’s Pig cloudy cider range flavours: Flat Tyre Cloudy Cider with Rhubarb, Handbrake Cloudy Cider with Damson and Rusted Wheel Cloudy Cider with Cherry, as well as its original apple-flavoured Rosie’s Pig Cloudy Cider (on-trade only). While the flavoured ciders were originally launched as limited-edition products, the four-strong range is now being launched on a permanent basis, due to its all-year-round appeal.

Rosie’s Pig Raspberry Roller is a refreshing berry flavoured cider with citrus notes, creating a well-balanced, easy-drinking cider with a fresh finish. Like the rest of the range, the still, cloudy cider comes in both a 330ml can (on and off-trade) as well as a 10-litre, fridge-friendly, bag-in-box format (on-trade only) with an ABV of 4%.

Designed by Cheltenham-based design agency BOS (Brand on Shelf), Rosie’s Pig Raspberry Roller’s pump clip, like the rest of the range, features the iconic Rosie’s Pig, which was Westons Cider’s original delivery truck.

Tim Williams, Rosie’s Pig brand manager, says: “We are very excited to be bringing Rosie’s Pig Raspberry Roller Cloudy Cider with Raspberry and Cucumber to market. The fruit cider category is growing at +10% year-on-year and the category now accounts for 27% of all cider sold*. The Rosie’s Pig range flavours of Rhubarb, Damson, Cherry, and now Raspberry and Cucumber will help to add further growth to the fruit cider category, bringing in new drinkers across all age groups.”

Westons Cider unveiled a new corporate brand identity in October to reflect the significant changes the business has undergone over the past seven years and to support its ambitious plans to grow the business by +40% by 2023, to reach in excess of £85m.

The cider producer is run by the fourth generation of the Weston family, which has been producing premium quality cider from its mill in Herefordshire since 1880.

Thatchers Katy, a traditional premium cider, has been crafted at Myrtle Farm for over 21 years, enjoying national distribution. It is being featured in an extensive outdoor campaign, including six-sheet and digital screen panels nationally supporting listings in Tesco, Waitrose, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Booker.

This will be accompanied by couponing and in-store sampling, as well as consumer advertising in retailer publications.

James Kennedy, head of off-trade for Somerset cidermaker Thatchers says,

“We’re seeing a major move towards premiumisation in the cider category. Consumers are prepared to spend more to enjoy a high quality, premium cider like Thatchers Katy. The values of heritage and provenance are important to consumers and there’s no better heritage than four generations of cidermaking here at Myrtle Farm, and over 500 acres of our own Somerset orchard.

“The Katy apple is grown in our orchards here at Myrtle Farm and is a very special apple to us, characterised by its beautiful bright red skin. A dessert apple, it provides the perfect balance of acidity and sweetness for a single variety cider, and is the perfect apple for an expertly crafted, traditional premium cider, a key message of this campaign.

“Apple ciders dominate the traditional premium sector, which is showing strong sales growth (up 15.9% vs YA*).

“This campaign will achieve an estimated 55 million views, bringing Thatchers Katy to the front of mind with consumers over the Easter period.”

A softly sparkling Somerset Cider, Katy is pressed and bottled at Thatchers’ Myrtle Farm from the red, juicy Katy apple. The 7.4% single variety cider is medium dry, with its natural fruit acidity making it a great pairing for foods such as fish and white meats.

The new campaign follows the first solus campaign for Katy, which appeared in November and December 2017, in the run-up to the Christmas period, and now appears pre and post Easter, a key time of the year for cider purchase.

The campaign runs from 26th March to 6th May, and includes participation in the Tesco Cider Festival.

The Thatchers cider brands will be front of mind with the public once again this year. Thatchers’ 2018 activity started in February with its TV campaign for Thatchers Gold, continuing throughout Spring and Summer with a refreshed marketing campaign with What Cider’s Supposed to Taste Like, including digital, social media, consumer and trade press, PR, as well as a new experiential and sampling campaign being launched in April.

The UK’s leading independent cidermaker is one of only a few alcohol manufacturers to secure this AA+ accreditation. Not only do Aston Manor boast top marks at the Tiverton facility, their site on Thimble Mill Lane in Birmingham has also earnt the same certification.

The BRC Global Standard audit is the most renowned certification program in the industry and examines all areas of Aston Manor’s operation. It has been developed to provide a framework for managing the quality and safety of food and drinks products. By displaying the highest-levels of manufacturing processes to packaging standards, the accreditation has demonstrated Aston Manor’s commitment to safety and their customers through the quality of their products.

Jamie Weall, head of compliance at Aston Manor Cider, said: “We’re delighted to achieve the top result again at our Tiverton facility. By achieving the best possible score at the unannounced audit really proves our entire team is dedicated to producing the best possible cider in the safest way. Our customers can have total confidence that everything that we produce at Aston Manor Cider is manufactured and packaged at the highest standard possible in the industry.”

“The real testament to our team is that they do not rest on their laurels. We have around 20 technical audits each year, with half of these being unannounced, and the hard work has already begun to maintain these high standards. We strive to keep achieving the top grades throughout these procedures whenever and wherever the auditors decided to drop by.”",Top marks for Aston Manor Cider in rigorous audit

Summer Vintage, a 7.4% cider available in 500ml bottles, has been inspired by a stroll through the cidermaker’s Somerset orchards, to create a light yet full flavoured cider for the summer months.

With a touch of sweetness from Thatchers’ choice of dessert apples, and added body and depth from bittersweet, this is a well-balanced, medium dry cider, with all important freshness for the warmer weather.

Martin Thatcher, fourth generation of the Sandford-based cidermaker says, “We first made this cider back in 2016 as a limited edition, and thanks to popular demand we’re now making it again for this year’s summer season. I love this cider – it’s easy to drink, naturally light in colour, with a delicate aroma, but at the same time has a rounded, full flavour, that comes from the mix of bittersweet and dessert apples that we press and blend here at Myrtle Farm.

“We hope that people will really enjoy this cider while – hopefully – enjoying the delights of the British summer.”

Thatchers Summer Vintage will sit alongside Thatchers Vintage and Thatchers Katy, and will be available online at www.thatcherscider.co.uk, in 279 Tesco stores nationwide from April 2018, and locally in the Thatchers Cider Shop in Sandford, Somerset.",THATCHERS INTRODUCES NEW SEASONAL CIDER

With glass-bottled apple ciders currently growing at an extremely robust +14.5%1 in the impulse channel, the Company believes that it’s the perfect time to launch a new product and grow the Merrydown range to a total of three complementary variants.

This latest development from Britain’s fastest growing and No.1 sharing cider2 will provide a boost for the impulse sector’s £76 million glass bottled cider category3 and result in a range of Merrydown cider styles able to meet a host of consumer needs and occasions.

The reintroduction of Merrydown Dry will address the joint demands of both consumers and trade stockists who were disappointed to see it withdrawn in 2017.

Packaged in the distinctive Merrydown 750ml glass sharing bottle and with a fresh label design to complement that introduced across the whole brand in 2017, new Merrydown Dry will be available from mid-May. With screw-cap closures and trade units of 6 and 12-bottle shrink-wrapped trays, the relaunched product will be available in the impulse sector at an RRP* of £2.69.

Merrydown Dry is a refreshingly crisp cider with a distinctive appley bite; it is made with the same perfect Sussex blend that has been delighting cider-lovers for decades.

Like all members of the Merrydown family, Dry contains no artificial sweeteners, colours or flavours and is both vegetarian and vegan-friendly. Merrydown ciders are made from hand-picked eating apples, as opposed to the bitter-sweet cider apples used by most producers. Merrydown’s apples are pressed within 24 hours to ensure maximum freshness and then double filtered to guarantee a crisp finish.

The relaunch of Merrydown Dry will be supported by on-shelf POS, trade mailers, and a social media campaign including giveaways and teaser posts. Support for the overall brand celebrates the ‘Merrydown Moment’ at the end of the day when cider-lovers want to sit down, relax, unwind and share a treat, and employs the strapline “Love your Merrydown time.”

With the reintroduction of Dry, the brand’s range now comprises three variants:
• Merrydown Dry: ABV: 6.8%; taste profile: dry (crisp and dry with an appley bite).
• Merrydown Crisp Apple: ABV: 5.5%; taste profile: crisp and light (30% less calories; only naturally sweetened with apple juice).

All three Merrydown ciders have the same £2.69 RRP* and are packaged in 750ml screw-cap bottles and sold in 6 and 12-pack trade units. The 750ml resealable sharing format gives Merrydown a point of difference over most other bottled ciders which are sold in 500ml crown-cap bottles.

Merrydown was created in 1946 by three friends who shared a passion for cider-making. Now, as in the beginning, the focus is purely on producing high-quality ciders. In the impulse channel, glass-bottled apple ciders are growing at +14.5%1, whereas bottled flavoured ciders are declining by -3.1%1; the reintroduction of Merrydown Dry will drive further apple cider growth.

Amanda Grabham, Head of Brand Marketing – Alcohol at SHS Drinks, says: “Back by popular demand is an oft overstated claim but with Merrydown Dry it is wholly appropriate: trade stockists and cider-lovers really missed it, so we had a re-think and brought it back. We’re confident that Dry’s loyal fans and previous trade stockists will welcome it back with open arms.

“Merrydown was created over 70 years ago by three founders each with different strengths and qualities and it’s great to see the current Merrydown portfolio now contain three high-quality variants, each with its own strengths and characteristics.

“Lighter, lower strength, lower-calorie Merrydown Crisp Apple has tapped into the trend for moderating consumption; award-winning best-seller Merrydown Original has focused on its heritage and quality cues and is currently growing volume at over +38% in impulse1; and the reintroduction of the much-missed Merrydown Dry variant will fuel further growth in the buoyant glass bottled apple cider segment in the convenience sector.

“With the sought-after return of Merrydown Dry, consumers can now relax and enjoy their Down-time with some extra dryness,” concludes Grabham.",MERRYDOWN DRY IS BACK!

Think 100% Irish has been created to encapsulate not only Magners’ impressive 80 year history producing cider from their County Tipperary home, but the Irish way of life, which is as much a part of the cider as the apples grown at the 150 acre onsite orchard.

The new campaign will kick off with a series of targeted online ads, which use every day observations and relatable situations to introduce how you could Think 100% Irish’ and look on the sunny side of life.

For example, you might have a boring office job – but at least you get paid to scroll Facebook. You might be worried you don’t quite ‘measure up’ – but don’t think it’s tiny – it’s fun size!

The adverts show a Magners pint glass which has been filled half way, sitting on a table in an outdoor sunny cider garden. They make light-hearted observations about everyday situations in a glass half full / half empty style.

This creative ties in perfectly with Magners’ sunny outlook and heroes the refreshing drink, and iconic over ice serve Magners is famous for.

Over the coming months, Think 100% Irish will be rolled out to include reactive stunts, experiential and festival activations.

The light-hearted new campaign is set to engage drinkers, showing them the silver lining to any situation, and encourage them to adopt the Irish outlook.

Janette Murray, Brand Manager of Magners UK said: “This is an exciting year for Magners. We wanted to inject some of that twinkley-eyed humour and love of a great laugh that the Irish are famous for. We’d like to encourage cider fans to follow our lead and look for the silver lining in everyday situations.”

“Our quirky new campaign won’t ask drinkers to start hugging trees or strangers in the street in a quest for positive vibes – but it will give them a laugh and help them see that modern life isn’t so bad.”

“We’ll be introducing the campaign to consumers in the coming weeks and taking advantage of every possible opportunity to help drive sales through the tills in both the on and off trade throughout the UK. Magners will also be present at 11 festivals across the country throughout the summer where I’m sure there will be plenty of occasions for consumers to try out their new Magners mindset.”",MAGNERS LAUNCH NEW “THINK 100% IRISH” CAMPAIGN

The company impressed the judges with its “shrewd investments in innovation and branding”. Aston Manor beat competition from six other food and drink businesses after demonstrating its commitment to the region and credentials as an outstanding cider supplier. They will now enter the national awards, Made in the UK, with other regional winners from across the UK.

Aston Manor has been making cider in the Midlands for 35 years. The company has its headquarters and logistics hub in Birmingham, its state-of-the-art pressing facility in Stourport-on-Severn and orchards across Worcestershire and Herefordshire. It has recently invested significantly to expand the business and ensure its manufacturing processes are seamless and environmentally friendly. Further, Aston Manor has committed to planting up to 400,00 new trees in Midlands orchards and in doing so agreed 25-year contracts with farmer and grower partners.

Picking up the award, Justin Way, marketing controller at Aston Manor, said “This is great recognition for Aston Manor, with the judging panel praising our approach to innovation, environmental sustainability and consistent investment in people and manufacturing capability to maintain the highest standards. We look forward to competing with other regional winners at the upcoming Made in the UK awards.”

Aston Manor was also shortlisted in the Manufacturer of The Year for companies with a turnover below £25m category.

The Made in the Midlands awards took place on Thursday 10 May at the Macdonald Burlington Hotel in Birmingham and was hosted by actor, writer and presenter Alexis Conran. The prestigious regional ceremony is now in its seventh year and recognises the innovation and excellence from across the Midlands in nine separate categories.

The introduction of Cornish Orchard’s new premium Dry Cider is bound to get people talking and taste buds tingling.

Founded by Andy Atkinson, Cornish Orchards has been making award-winning ciders from 100% freshly pressed apples since 1999.

Based at Westnorth Manor Farm in Duloe, which is near Looe on the South Cornish Coast, their team of highly passionate cider makers work harmoniously with the seasons to create a range of apple based ciders that are hand-blended, fermented and matured throughout the winter months right here on the farm.

Consumers today look for brands that offer more in in terms of quality and provenance and are willing to pay higher prices for these products.

Cornish Orchards noticed a gap in the market for a premium cider that met the taste requirements of a traditional cider drinker, yet had an appeal to your modern day cider drinker.

Using their passion for cider making, the team set out to create an exceptional and refined dry cider with a typical Westcountry Character which was the perfect way to bridge that gap.

The dry cider is made from a blend of bittersweet and dessert apples that have been specially selected for their soft tannins and traditional flavour giving the cider a long dry finish; a perfect choice for those seeking a natural tasting, dry apple cider.

The 5.2% dry cider is currently available in 500ml bottles and 50 Litre keg and has become a premium serve for many restaurants and bars across the Duchy and beyond.

Andy Atkinson, Founder of Cornish Orchards says, “This new Dry Cider meets the fundamental needs of consumers in this ever-evolving marketplace. Cornish Orchards now have this unique premium product that is highly sessionable and can be thoroughly enjoyed all year round. I am excited to see this product take off as I know it will.”

‘The Wonderfulness of Local’ campaign highlights the premium quality of Stowford Press cider, exemplified by the locally-sourced apples used to create every pint. It features comedian Ellie Taylor and adventurer Alastair Humphreys exploring the glorious countryside around Westons’ cider mill in Much Marcle, Herefordshire.

“The key objective of our TV creative was to tap into a brand truth that had the ability to engage consumers emotionally,” explains brand manager Holly Chadwick. “Within this, we know our consumers value premium, local ingredients and provenance, and are actively seeking out experiences over material things.”

“This drove our thinking around the new TV advert. Through the new creative we wanted to find an entertaining and engaging way to communicate the fact that unlike some other ciders, all of the apples used in Stowford Press are grown within just 50 miles of our cider mill.”

“Although Stowford Press is a major national brand in both the on and off-trades, we will always stay true to the local heart of our brand and celebrate the wonderfulness of local.”

The TV ad, which has been produced in 60”, 30” and 10” edits, will premier during Channel 4 and ITV’s prime time Friday night schedules, to be followed by a 10-week campaign which adds further channels including Sky Media and BT Sport and will deliver significant national coverage for the brand.

TV advertising will be supported by a programme of high-profile sponsorships, consumer PR, on-trade and in-store customer marketing, blogger activation and social media activity, all celebrating the wonderfulness of local and adding up to the biggest marketing package ever put behind Stowford Press.

The new TV commercials were created and produced by Red Bee and directed by Ollie Parsons. Alongside the main Stowford Press apple variant, they also feature Stowford Press Mixed Berries cider which was launched in the on-trade in March this year.

“As we predicted at the time,” says Chadwick, “Stowford Press Mixed Berries has had a rapturous reception from the trade and consumers alike. This new campaign will highlight the quality of our cider and will bring the Stowford Press brand to even more people’s attention.”",STOWFORD PRESS CELEBRATES ‘THE WONDERFULNESS OF LOCAL’

Bang on trend

 With over three million Brits interested in taking part in ‘Dry January’ this year, it’s no secret that millennials are thinking more about what they put in their bodies. They are drinking less in terms of quantity and more in terms of quality. Discerning drinkers want to know where their food and drink is from, what’s in it, how it’s made and the heritage and provenance of a brand. Sheppy’s real cider meets these needs. Each of Sheppy’s cider variants are made by the Master of Cider himself, David Sheppy, using methods, knowledge and expertise handed down over six generations.

David Sheppy comments: “We spotted the growing trend for low alcohol as consumers’ lifestyle choices are changing. People like to enjoy a drink or two but are looking for options with lower alcohol – that still taste great and are made well. Our new cider offers all our craft credentials; flavour and excellent quality, with a lower ABV. I have spent a lot of time perfecting this recipe to ensure that it stays true to our traditional craft cider roots. The team are thrilled with the result and are looking forward to sharing it with visitors at Imbibe Live!”

Release to coincide with launch of a novel new Cider using Pioneering On-Leaf Fermentation Method.

Devon cider makers Sandford Orchards unveiled their new Fine Cider Range today, involving a pioneering new technique which has its roots both in winemaking and ancient cider production. Sandford Orchards’ new single variety Yarlington Mill cider is produced using ‘on leaf’ fermentation, a concept inspired by whole-bunch fermentation found in modern winemaking. This is the first time this method of fermentation has been used to produce a cider.

The idea of adding fresh apple leaves to fermentation first came to Barny Butterfield, owner of Sandford Orchards, after reading yeast trial results from the 1900s. Building on the concept, Barny added fresh apple leaves from a Sweet Alford tree to a batch of single variety Yarlington Mill juice at harvest. “I wanted to see if the leaves had an impact on the aromatics of the juice, as hinted in the trial results” explained Barny, “and we were blown away by the results.” Blind tastings of the juice have produced a wide range of comments pronouncing the juice “fresher and fruiter, with extra zing”.

To add strength to the findings Sandford Orchards called on their connections with the University of Exeter mycology department. Inspired by the taste findings, the team are currently working on profiling the metabolic pathway of the microbes present in the on-leaf fermentation, alongside other research including gene sequencing and microbiome comparison. “We are delighted to be working alongside Sandford Orchards on this project” commented Dr Jane Usher, University of Exeter. “The on-leaf fermentation produces a profoundly more impressive bouquet with increased complexity and subtlety, I am optimistic that our research will help us to understand the reasons behind it”.

A small release of 100 cases of the first batch on Yarlington Mill – On-leaf is now available alongside Tremletts Bitter, Single Variety Cider, the second cider in Sandford Orchards’ Fine Cider Range, which uses natural yeasts found in the Cider Works, Sandford Orchards’ home, and a working cider works since 1932.

Sandford Orchards are craft cider makers from the heart of Devon.

This two-year project worked to identify varieties of cider apples and perry-making pears. A tour to explain the findings is starting a tour of venues across Wales.

The project had three strands; working with community orchards across Wales, researching Heritage Welsh Cider apples and Perry Pears trees; while USW worked on capturing the Modern Story of Cider Making in Wales.

It also worked with 13 community groups across Wales to regenerate old orchards and/or plant new apple and pear trees.

During the work, cider and perry varieties were planted, while the community groups managing the sites were supported with skills to maintain and develop the biodiversity of the site. They were also given traditional orchard management skills to pass on to new volunteers and future generations.

The project identified and re-discovered a total of 99 Welsh varieties (39 apples and 60 pears), these were found all over Wales. This was achieved by DNA testing samples and then comparing the results to Brogdale’s National Fruit Collection database.

Where possible, the unique trees were propagated from graftwood, to create National Collections of Welsh cider & Perry trees.

These are being hosted at Abersytwth University, IBERS campus and two National Trust properties; Erddig Hall & Dyffryn Gardens. A forth one – the Society’s own Museum orchard – is split over two sites, one in Llanarth and one just outside of Usk. These will all hold two of each variety, acting as a genetic resource to ensure the preservation of these varieties as a valuable part of Welsh natural heritage.

Juice from the fruit was fermented in single-variety trials. Information will be shared in an online catalogue of ‘Welsh Heritage Cider and Perry Fruit Varieties’.

​Catrin James, of the George Ewart Evans Centre for Storytelling, explained the success of the project.

“By travelling the length and width of Wales, a digital archive was created to capture the modern tradition of orchards and cider making in Wales,” she said.

“The archive is a collection of oral histories and digital stories, including interviews recorded with cider and perry producers, community orchard groups, heritage organisations and individuals involved in orcharding and producing Welsh cider and perry.”

Richard Bellamy, Head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Wales, said: “The Heritage of Orchards and Cider Making in Wales was a truly unique project, using National Lottery funding to uncover some amazing fruit varieties that had long since been forgotten about. This work is not only fascinating with a great story to tell, but potentially really important for the British food and drink industry too. Thank you National Lottery players for giving us a sweet start to Spring!”

The collection is available online at The Welsh Perry & Cider Society website and is archived in the collections of The People’s Collection Wales and St Fagans National History Museum. This element of the project was delivered by the George Ewart Evans Centre for Storytelling at the University of South Wales.

In an update to its guidance notes on what constitutes agricultural use of land for inheritance tax purposes, the tax office has extended its definition of food to include fruit used to make wines and ciders. This means that the value of the land will be up to 100 per cent tax-free when left in an estate.

Richard Crane, the head of the farms and estates team at BKL, an accountancy firm, says: “This may be seen as a significant extension to tax-planning opportunities because it will become widely known that land for producing wine and cider is eligible for agricultural property relief. The relief is not limited to land within the UK but extends throughout the European Economic Area, which could be an attraction for investors looking to reduce their inheritance tax liabilities while having the pleasure of owning a vineyard.”

BKL says that although only grapes and apples for cider are mentioned specifically by HMRC, a case could be made for other fruit, such as pears used to make perry.

The British wine industry, which primarily produces sparkling white wines, is growing rapidly. It is being boosted by a warming climate that is hitting the wine-growing sweet spot of an average of 14C throughout the April to October growing season, and a higher profile for British products worldwide.

The amount of British land planted with vines has increased 150 per cent in the past ten years and tripled since 2000, according to Wine GB, the national association for the English and Welsh wine industry. Production is predicted to reach 40 million bottles by 2040.

The market in British wines began to take off in 2003 when Nyetimber, which owns vineyards in Sussex, Hampshire and Kent, beat some of the best known champagnes in taste tests. Since then French champagne houses Taittinger and Pommery have invested in British vineyards.

Ed Mansel Lewis, the head of the viticulture group at Strutt & Parker, an estate agency, says: “These two nods of approval have given the UK credibility as a new-world wine- producing region.”

Those keen to invest in the industry should be aware that it takes time for your assets to mature. If you planted your first vines this spring it wouldn’t be until 2023 that your vineyard would have a viable harvest and another two years before you had any wine to sell. The best vineyard land sells for between £13,000 and £15,000 an acre, compared with between £8,000 and £9,000 for arable land. The minimum plot size needed is ten acres.

Simon Robinson, the owner of Hattingley Valley winery and chairman of Wine GB, says he knows of good vine land trading for up to £20,000 an acre and that it can fetch 50 per cent to 75 per cent more than other farm land.

“A lot of vines are being planted in Britain, 2.5 million are expected over the next year. The issue is where are all those grapes going to go?,” Robinson says.

A vineyard owner could sell their grapes to the larger producers for roughly £2,000 a tonne depending on the quality (you can expect about three tonnes of grapes an acre). They could rent out the land, or try to make the wine themselves.

However, with harvests dependent on the weather there is the risk that they could earn nothing in a bad year.

In a good year, like last year, Lewis cautions that commercial wineries were so overloaded with fruit that they turned away grapes from smaller growers. Britain doesn’t have either a network of companies or co-operatives, such as in France, to help small-scale investors process their grapes.",Windfall for cider orchard owners

Blossomtime in Putley is centred on a cider tasting in the parish hall, based on entries from the Big Apple Cider and Perry Trials with well over 100 ciders and perries expected to be available to taste.

Together with its surrounding parishes, Putley is famous for its orchards. Visitors can walk through the orchards, taste the ciders, enjoy a home-made lunch or tea – and discover for themselves why orchards are such special places and apples matter to us all.

He was the overseer on the Putley Court Estate nearly 150 years ago when acres of orchards – or plantations – were established in the parish. On Monday morning, Norman will be telling the ‘overseer’s tale’ and sharing the secret of ‘Thrown Hat’ cider.

Putley will also be welcoming some special guests. On Sunday morning, authors and cidermakers Susanna Forbes, Gabe Cook and Simon Day will be giving their thoughts on whether Herefordshire has more to learn from, or to give to, the New World when it comes to cidermaking. Talks will take place at Dragon Orchard at 11am. There are also visits to The Juice to learn about the secret life of Pixley Berries, and how their pressing machines are being put to use for cidermaking. And just up the road, Helen and Andrew Riga will welcome visitors to Yew Tree Farm to taste their single variety perries under each of the trees which produced the pears. Dancing from Leominster Morris and music from Fiddlers Two add the final touches to a special countryside experience.

The latest in a string of sustainability initiatives being implemented by Thatchers, this change will see around 70 tons of aluminium saved each year, thanks to switching to Ardagh Group’s lighter weight beverage cans. Thatchers Cider expects to save approximately 381 tons CO in 2019 by using only the lighter weight can.

Thatchers was the first cidermaker to ditch plastic ring carriers on its four-pack of cans, introducing instead recyclable board outers.

Martin Thatcher, fourth generation cidermaker says, “We’re looking at many different ways of reducing our impact on the environment. As well as running a business, we are all, as individuals, passionate about cutting waste and doing our bit to bring about change. Lightweighting our cans means less energy used across the packaging process. “We’re producing around 100 million cans a year at Myrtle Farm, so this initiative will make a big impact. “Investing in sustainability is one of our key priorities. However, it’s equally important to retain quality, ensuring that the durability of the new lighter cans is not affected. So the Ardagh Group worked hard to get the weight exactly right.” continues Martin.

Thatchers produces its family favourites range of ciders in cans – namely Thatchers Gold, Haze and Rosé. Throughout the cider market cans continue to be hugely important, driving market growth with a 52.5% share (Total Cider & Perry volume IRi 52w/e 2nd March 2019). Thatchers flagship cider, Thatchers Gold, is the number 2 canned apple cider in the UK, and is enjoying continued growth in shopper numbers.

Martin continues, “We’re working towards eliminating all plastic from our consumer packaging for cans and bottles. Removing plastic ring carriers is the first of what we hope will be a number of industry-leading initiatives in this area. We’re continuing to invest in sustainability throughout all stages of the cidermaking process, from development of our new energy efficient warehouse and mill at Myrtle Farm, through to ambitious plans to reduce to zero, waste sent to landfill from the cidermaking process.”",Thatchers introduces lighter weight cans

They are drinking less in terms of quantity and more in terms of quality. Discerning drinkers want to know where their food and drink is from, what’s in it, how it’s made and the heritage and provenance of a brand. Sheppy’s real cider meets these needs. Each of Sheppy’s cider variants are made by the Master of Cider himself, David Sheppy, using methods, knowledge and expertise handed down over six generations.

David Sheppy comments: “We spotted the growing trend for low alcohol as consumers’ lifestyle choices are changing. People like to enjoy a drink or two but are looking for options with lower alcohol – that still taste great and are made well. Our new cider offers all our craft credentials; flavour and excellent quality, with a lower ABV. I have spent a lot of time perfecting this recipe to ensure that it stays true to our traditional craft cider roots. The team are thrilled with the result and are looking forward to sharing it with visitors at Imbibe Live!”

Blossomtime in Putley is centred on a cider tasting in the parish hall, based on entries from the Big Apple Cider and Perry Trials with well over 100 ciders and perries expected to be available to taste.

Together with its surrounding parishes, Putley is famous for its orchards. Visitors can walk through the orchards, taste the ciders, enjoy a home-made lunch or tea – and discover for themselves why orchards are such special places and apples matter to us all. Norman Stanier’s great grandfather Harry Taylor could have told you a thing or two about that. He was the overseer on the Putley Court Estate nearly 150 years ago when acres of orchards – or plantations – were established in the parish. On Monday morning, Norman will be telling the ‘overseer’s tale’ and sharing the secret of ‘Thrown Hat’ cider.

Putley will also be welcoming some special guests. On Sunday morning, authors and cidermakers Susanna Forbes, Gabe Cook and Simon Day will be giving their thoughts on whether Herefordshire has more to learn from, or to give to, the New World when it comes to cidermaking. Talks will take place at Dragon Orchard at 11am. There are also visits to The Juice to learn about the secret life of Pixley Berries, and how their pressing machines are being put to use for cidermaking. And just up the road, Helen and Andrew Riga will welcome visitors to Yew Tree Farm to taste their single variety perries under each of the trees which produced the pears. Dancing from Leominster Morris and music from Fiddlers Two add the final touches to a special countryside experience.

Putley Parish Hall will be open for the Grand Cider Tasting and Teas from 2pm–6pm on Sunday 5th May and from 12–5pm on Monday 6th May.

This two-year project worked to identify varieties of cider apples and perry-making pears. A tour to explain the findings is starting a tour of venues across Wales.

The project had three strands; working with community orchards across Wales, researching Heritage Welsh Cider apples and Perry Pears trees; while USW worked on capturing the Modern Story of Cider Making in Wales.

It also worked with 13 community groups across Wales to regenerate old orchards and/or plant new apple and pear trees.

During the work, cider and perry varieties were planted, while the community groups managing the sites were supported with skills to maintain and develop the biodiversity of the site. They were also given traditional orchard management skills to pass on to new volunteers and future generations.

The project identified and re-discovered a total of 99 Welsh varieties (39 apples and 60 pears), these were found all over Wales. This was achieved by DNA testing samples and then comparing the results to Brogdale’s National Fruit Collection database.

Where possible, the unique trees were propagated from graftwood, to create National Collections of Welsh cider & Perry trees.

These are being hosted at Abersytwth University, IBERS campus and two National Trust properties; Erddig Hall & Dyffryn Gardens. A forth one – the Society’s own Museum orchard – is split over two sites, one in Llanarth and one just outside of Usk. These will all hold two of each variety, acting as a genetic resource to ensure the preservation of these varieties as a valuable part of Welsh natural heritage.

Juice from the fruit was fermented in single-variety trials. Information will be shared in an online catalogue of ‘Welsh Heritage Cider and Perry Fruit Varieties’.

​Catrin James, of the George Ewart Evans Centre for Storytelling, explained the success of the project.

“By travelling the length and width of Wales, a digital archive was created to capture the modern tradition of orchards and cider making in Wales,” she said.

“The archive is a collection of oral histories and digital stories, including interviews recorded with cider and perry producers, community orchard groups, heritage organisations and individuals involved in orcharding and producing Welsh cider and perry.”

Richard Bellamy, Head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Wales, said: “The Heritage of Orchards and Cider Making in Wales was a truly unique project, using National Lottery funding to uncover some amazing fruit varieties that had long since been forgotten about. This work is not only fascinating with a great story to tell, but potentially really important for the British food and drink industry too. Thank you National Lottery players for giving us a sweet start to Spring!”

The collection is available online at The Welsh Perry & Cider Society website and is archived in the collections of The People’s Collection Wales and St Fagans National History Museum. This element of the project was delivered by the George Ewart Evans Centre for Storytelling at the University of South Wales.

The Award was presented to Stonegate CEO, Simon Longbottom, at the annual APPBG Dinner in Westminster, in recognition of the company’s impressive commitment to charity support across its pubs and head office. Stonegate raises around £1.5 million for charity every year, supporting a wide range of worthy national and local causes.

Co-founder of PubAid, Des O’Flanagan said, “Everyone on the PubAid Steering Group was impressed by Stonegate’s support for charity. Fundraising is seen not as a ‘nice to do’ add-on, but a fundamental part of running a Stonegate pub.

“Managers and their teams demonstrate huge creativity and dedication in their fundraising, which embraces a variety of activities, from Fun Days to fancy dress events, sporting challenges and larger, region-wide initiatives, such as the ‘Spartan Walk’, where 300 southern pubs raised £73,500 for Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospice. Head office are also active within their community in Luton, with ongoing support for the local children’s hospital.”

PubAid also highlighted Stonegate’s northern division’s mission to raise £60,000 for MIND and the Scottish Association for Mental Health. A whopping £45,000 has already been raised by the pubs and bars with a further £9,000 raised by the management and support team who trekked the gruelling Three Peaks. Fundraising continues until September so they are on track to hit the target.

On receiving the award Longbottom said, “It is an honour to receive this award in recognition of the tremendous amount of community fundraising and the phenomenal amount of money raised each year for charities large and small by our pubs and support team.”

Mike Wood, MP for Dudley South and Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, said “Stonegate has shown what can be achieved when charity support is embedded within a company’s culture, with all employees empowered and enthused to do their bit to help. Raising £1.5 million a year is a fantastic result and we are delighted to name them as the winner of our Corporate Charity Fundraiser award.”

As well as the Corporate Charity Fundraiser of the Year award, PubAid also recognises outstanding charity support by individual pubs with the Charity Fundraising Pub of the Year award. This award, supported by Magners, was presented for the first time earlier this year, with the Logan Rock in Treen, Cornwall, taking the winner’s title ahead of seven other pubs on a very strong shortlist.

The Corporate Charity Fundraiser award is in its fourth year. Previous winners are JD Wetherspoon, Greene King and Joseph Holt.

The four-year agreement between Magners Irish Cider and Jockey Club Racecourses will see the first ‘Magners Cheltenham Gold Cup’ on Friday, 15 March 2019, the feature race on the final day of Jump racing’s showpiece event.

In addition, the agreement, which will run until 2022, will also see Magners Irish Cider become the Presenting Partner across all four days of The FestivalTM, which will be recognised as ‘The FestivalTM, presented by Magners’.

Today’s announcement represents the first major horse racing sponsorship by Magners, which is produced in Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland and is part of Dublin-headquartered C&C Group plc.

The partnership between Jockey Club Racecourses and Magners Irish Cider, celebrates the brand’s Irish heritage by associating with the leading British and Irish-attended event in the UK, attracting crowds of over 260,000 annually, and watched by millions of horse racing fans across the world via TV and digital platforms.

The FestivalTM is the fourth biggest sporting event in the UK, in terms of the total number of visitors, and takes place over four days at the world famous Prestbury Park racecourse in Gloucestershire. In addition, The FestivalTM has broad and increasing appeal in Ireland, with approximately one third of tickets sold in 2018 going to Irish race-goers. The FestivalTM 2018 was another fruitful year for the Irish, with punters witnessing 17 Irish-trained winners during four days of competitive Jump racing.

From 2019 to 2022, this agreement means Jump racing’s showpiece event will become the ‘Magners Cheltenham Gold Cup’. The FestivalTM will now be referred to as ‘The FestivalTM, presented by Magners’.

The Cheltenham Gold Cup has a long and illustrious history and takes place at level weights over three and a quarter miles and 22 fences. Its victory roll features the finest staying chasers ever to grace the turf, including Arkle, Best Mate, Golden Miller, Kauto Star and Mill House. 2018 saw an epic renewal, with Native River seeing off the challenge of Might Bite in a thrilling championship contest.

Jason Ash, Chief Marketing Officer of C&C Group plc, said: “Magners Cider is 100% Irish, made in Clonmel, County Tipperary, where William Magner first started making cider over 80 years ago. Famous for our Irish heritage, sociability and positive view on life we are truly excited to put our name to the most prestigious Jump race in Europe and partner with one of the UK’s best sporting and social occasions as a platform to engage fans and bring Magners to a global audience.

Given The FestivalTM is a major occasion in the sporting calendar of racing fans across the world, especially in the UK and Ireland, we are delighted to be a part of such an iconic event. We see our partnership with The FestivalTM and the Magners Cheltenham Gold Cup as a perfect fit, providing a year-round platform to bring to life our new “100% Irish” positioning to consumers in the UK and internationally.

We look forward to working with The Jockey Club to engage horse racing fans across multiple platforms, including at The FestivalTM, in the On and Off-trades, and via advertising, digital and social activation”.

Ian Renton, Cheltenham and South West Regional Director for Jockey Club Racecourses, said: “To work with Magners over the next four years is something our whole team is hugely looking forward to. I believe this partnership with a brand of provenance and heritage like Magners will provide a big opportunity for both parties.

In the build-up to The FestivalTM each year, a third of the tickets purchased are by Irish race-goers, so we feel this partnership is a great fit and we’re delighted to be working alongside a partner with such a strong Irish heritage and appeal in the UK, Ireland and beyond.

As well as looking forward to staging the first Magners Cheltenham Gold Cup, 2019 will be the first time The FestivalTM has had a Presenting Partner to promote the whole event to an even wider audience.”",MAGNERS UNVEILED AS EXCLUSIVE SPONSOR OF CHELTENHAM GOLD CUP

Addressing members of the NACM and attendees at the All Party Parliamentary Cider Group (APPCG) on Tuesday 11 September, Gordon outlined his vision to ensure a sustainable future for producers, whatever their scale.

He called for a fair and balanced regulatory environment for cider makers to operate in and asked for the support from MPs, Ministers and officials to back the UK industry – home to the largest cider market in the world.

Gordon promoted the need for a collaborative approach and all involved to give the industry the best opportunity to flourish.

Speaking about becoming chair, Gordon commented: “I’ve enjoyed a significant amount of my career in the cider industry and a great part of my life living in the cider heartland, so I am relishing the opportunity to lead the industry.

“No matter the size of the cider maker, everyone is committed to apples and agriculture – that is the most important message I want to get across. The industry is facing a number of complex challenges, but through a united approach we can certainly deliver a future that is innovative and sustainable.

“We need an excise duty structure that allows producers to grow, a robust examination of evidence in all policy issues and of course, cider makers to have the common goal to celebrate this diverse industry that provides for ever consumer and occasion – here in the UK and across the world.”

Fenella Tyler, the chief executive of the NACM, spoke about the appointment: “Gordon has been the deputy chair for two years and has already made a significant contribution. We expect he will continue to do great work to advance the interests of all cider markets for the benefit of all cider drinkers.”

Before joining Aston Manor Cider, Gordon was previously the managing director at Magners GB. He will be the chair of the NACM for two years and has replaced Helen Thomas of Westons Cider.","NACM Welcomes New Chairman, Gordon Johncox from Aston Manor"

The new duty band for mid-strength cider will come into effect from 1st February 2019 and the new duty rate for ciders between 6.9% and 7.5% ABV will be announced on 29th October. The increase in excise duty that this brings will negatively impact nearly all cider makers, with the inadvertent consequences felt most by smaller cider makers.

In their submission to the Treasury ahead of the Autumn Budget, the NACM has asked for special consideration to be given to cider. Gordon Johncox, chair of the NACM explains “Cider has been in decline since 2009 and the impacts are being felt across the industry and the cider supply chain. Apple contracts in the South West, Herefordshire and other cider making regions are ending as the cider industry requirement for apples falls.” The standard cider category is now 25% smaller than it was 9 years ago, resulting in fewer apples needed to meet consumer demand. In the same period changes to excise duty have resulted in the tax on cider moving closer to other categories.

“We need a 2p per pint reduction in excise duty for standard cider, which will help return the standard cider category to growth, but also give a much needed boost to the smaller cider makers who are impacted by the new duty band. Most cider makers will make ciders in both the standard and the mid-strength duty band, so this reduction would help soften the blow when the new duty rate comes in next February.” Gordon explains. “The case for more support for small cider makers is growing day by day. We are asking the Treasury to introduce a progressive cider duty that would support small cider makers to grow, innovate and create more jobs. However, we ask that they consider how best this can be achieved whilst continuing to protect the smallest cider makers who currently benefit from the 70Hl duty relief”.

The NACM has explained to the Treasury that the current concerns around post Brexit impacts on the cider industry, continue to create more uncertainty for the industry, especially around export and supply chain issues. Uncertainty about the tax increase that will be announced on 29th October for the new duty band has added to industry uncertainty. Cider makers create rural jobs, invest in their communities and encourage over half a million tourists to visit each year. Gordon concludes “Cider really is a Great British success story and we ask that it is given more support to encourage growth, innovation and success. We hope that we will be raising a glass of cider to the Chancellor next Monday”.",FAIRER TREATMENT FOR CIDER CALL AHEAD OF THE AUTUMN BUDGET

The Thatchers Young Talent Programme is in its first full year and has just seen 17 apprentices and graduates start work with the Somerset-based cidermaker. Thatchers is delivering high-quality, inspirational work experience and development opportunities, preparing people for work in this world-class industry. IGD is a national research and training charity at the heart of the food and grocery industry.

Martin Thatcher, fourth generation cidermaker at Thatchers says, “It is a real honour to be recognised by IGD with this award for our Young Talent Programme. Over recent years we have found that knowledge about careers within the food and drink sector hasn’t met our needs as an emerging business, so we wanted to create our own apprenticeship programme to attract the best people and invest in training and development.”

Emma Cox, training coordinator at Thatchers adds, “We started from a blank sheet of paper, and in just twelve months by working with local schools, colleges and universities we have developed and compiled an apprenticeship and graduate programme that is tailored to the needs of our industry, not only helping young people start on their career path, but importantly developing the skilled workforce that as a growing company we need at Thatchers.”

Fiona Miller, Head of Employability and Skills at IGD, said: “Already reaching over 10,000 young people, we were blown away by the results Thatchers is achieving after just 12 months of its Young Talent programme. The Thatchers team has a strong understanding of the education landscape and has developed a long-term strategy and comprehensive programme that puts the needs of young people at its heart. They run engaging activities for school and university students, and work collaboratively with teachers and parents, to empower young people to make informed decisions about their future. It’s great to see that the young talent pipeline is already building as a result, and that they work closely with other business in the region to share best practice.”

UK cider makers are under tremendous pressure and whilst we had asked for a reduction in duty, we are pleased that he has listened to our concerns and ensured that the current level of decline does not deteriorate further. The new duty rate for the mid-strength duty band, for ciders between 6.9% and 7.5% ABV of £50.71, introduced from 1st February 2019, will result in an increase of more than 10p per litre bottle. An increase that will impact a large number of cider makers across the UK of all sizes and something that they are disappointed about. Gordon Johncox, chair of the National Association of Cider Makers commented “Great British ciders are a part of rural tradition in many parts of the UK and by freezing cider duty today, the Chancellor has given support to our great industry. Whilst the Chancellor has been very fair in freezing cider duty, we are still concerned for those cider makers inadvertently impacted by the new mid-strength duty band.”",CIDER DUTY FROZEN IN THE BUDGET

Gordon outlined how collaboration across the industry by cider makers of all scales is a positive feature, though the hard-pressed sector still needs support from government.

As a relatively small industry, representing the best interests of every cider maker informs all aspects of activity of the NACM. The vision of the association is that all producers can operate successfully and fairly in a competitive market, whilst continuing to support their communities, employees and apple growers.

To enable this, he called for a balanced regulatory environment for cider makers reflecting the unique circumstances of producers. In particular, MPs, Ministers and officials were urged to deliver a consistent application of regulations.

Gordon challenged the Government’s willingness to understand the specific situations of cider makers. While headlines from the Autumn budget stated that cider duty was frozen, ciders in the middle duty band received a 25% tax increase, impacting many small cider makers.

Following his speech, Gordon commented: “Cider businesses of all sizes are working hard to deliver a sustainable future for the benefit of consumers and the rural environment. The industry is a significant part of British heritage.

“We need the support of politicians to work with us to return cider to more positive results, remove red tape and the unnecessary rules that limit innovation and investment. This support can enable cider makers produce fantastic products that interest in our category.

“We work to see every cider maker flourish and grow in line with their ambitions, whilst maintaining the highest standards. We firmly believe that with our collaborative nature and how we support one another this can be achieved when we can rely on consistent and sensible legislation.

“In recent months we have seen members providing orcharding experts when others experience weather related problems, large companies have supported smaller producers to expand their packaging ranges. When something is challenging or if advice is needed, small producers will always be supported, and to me, this is why the UK cider industry is so very special.”

The Parliamentary Cider Group Reception was an opportunity to showcase the best of British cider, which is home to the largest cider market in the world. The evening was attended by cider makers from across the South West, Midlands and further afield, as well as many MPs that represent cider making regions within their constituencies.

The neglected, surplus fruit is donated and collected from London’s gardens, orchards and parks where it would otherwise be left to rot, making the cider a unique London brew; 100% local with no air miles and a very minimal carbon footprint. Its consumers can also feel good about supporting a food waste reduction initiative, while enjoying a different taste with every harvest (the varieties of apples used in each batch vary depending on which fruit is donated). The project has even started to source its fruit from commercial supply chains and hopes to explore this avenue further, – a win-win for conscious businesses and cider fans alike!

An army of dedicated volunteers powers the Community Cider Hub under the direction of two part-time female cider makers from The Orchard Project. Nearly 700 volunteers have been trained in harvesting, pressing and bottling the since its inception in 2016, making this a true community effort. The charity ensures that each person leaves with an increased awareness of food waste issues and a free bottle of Local Fox Cider of course. Every part of the process, from scratting and pressing to bottling and labelling, is conducted handcrafted, using traditional methods to preserve our cider heritage.
• Over 15 tonnes of fruit transformed into beverages since 2016.
• Approximately 15,000 bottles of cider and juice produced since 2016.
• Individuals and community orchards who donate fruit are given cider, tools or training on fruit tree care in return.

While this unique, food waste-reducing craft cider movement continues to bloom, its funding is sadly coming to an end. The Orchard Project has launched a Crowdfunding campaign to save the Community Cider Hub and ensure it continues to thrive and grow. The campaign is live from 7th November until 10th December 2018. With a target of £17,500 to raise, the charity is urging people to spread the word and support the campaign at www.crowdfunder.co.uk/localfox. Those who pledge can bag some exciting rewards, from cider gift boxes and signed cider books, to fruit tree pruning and grafting workshops and exclusive artwork.

This latest development from Britain’s fastest growing and No.1 sharing cider2 will provide a boost for the impulse sector’s £76 million glass bottled cider category3 and result in a range of Merrydown cider styles able to meet a host of consumer needs and occasions.

The reintroduction of Merrydown Dry will address the joint demands of both consumers and trade stockists who were disappointed to see it withdrawn in 2017.

Packaged in the distinctive Merrydown 750ml glass sharing bottle and with a fresh label design to complement that introduced across the whole brand in 2017, new Merrydown Dry will be available from mid-May. With screw-cap closures and trade units of 6 and 12-bottle shrink-wrapped trays, the relaunched product will be available in the impulse sector at an RRP* of £2.69.

Merrydown Dry is a refreshingly crisp cider with a distinctive appley bite; it is made with the same perfect Sussex blend that has been delighting cider-lovers for decades.

Like all members of the Merrydown family, Dry contains no artificial sweeteners, colours or flavours and is both vegetarian and vegan-friendly. Merrydown ciders are made from hand-picked eating apples, as opposed to the bitter-sweet cider apples used by most producers. Merrydown’s apples are pressed within 24 hours to ensure maximum freshness and then double filtered to guarantee a crisp finish.

The relaunch of Merrydown Dry will be supported by on-shelf POS, trade mailers, and a social media campaign including giveaways and teaser posts. Support for the overall brand celebrates the ‘Merrydown Moment’ at the end of the day when cider-lovers want to sit down, relax, unwind and share a treat, and employs the strapline “Love your Merrydown time.”

With the reintroduction of Dry, the brand’s range now comprises three variants:
• Merrydown Dry: ABV: 6.8%; taste profile: dry (crisp and dry with an appley bite).
• Merrydown Crisp Apple: ABV: 5.5%; taste profile: crisp and light (30% less calories; only naturally sweetened with apple juice).

All three Merrydown ciders have the same £2.69 RRP* and are packaged in 750ml screw-cap bottles and sold in 6 and 12-pack trade units. The 750ml resealable sharing format gives Merrydown a point of difference over most other bottled ciders which are sold in 500ml crown-cap bottles.

Merrydown was created in 1946 by three friends who shared a passion for cider-making. Now, as in the beginning, the focus is purely on producing high-quality ciders. In the impulse channel, glass-bottled apple ciders are growing at +14.5%1, whereas bottled flavoured ciders are declining by -3.1%1; the reintroduction of Merrydown Dry will drive further apple cider growth.

Amanda Grabham, Head of Brand Marketing – Alcohol at SHS Drinks, says: “Back by popular demand is an oft overstated claim but with Merrydown Dry it is wholly appropriate: trade stockists and cider-lovers really missed it, so we had a re-think and brought it back. We’re confident that Dry’s loyal fans and previous trade stockists will welcome it back with open arms.

“Merrydown was created over 70 years ago by three founders each with different strengths and qualities and it’s great to see the current Merrydown portfolio now contain three high-quality variants, each with its own strengths and characteristics.

“Lighter, lower strength, lower-calorie Merrydown Crisp Apple has tapped into the trend for moderating consumption; award-winning best-seller Merrydown Original has focused on its heritage and quality cues and is currently growing volume at over +38% in impulse1; and the reintroduction of the much-missed Merrydown Dry variant will fuel further growth in the buoyant glass bottled apple cider segment in the convenience sector.

“With the sought-after return of Merrydown Dry, consumers can now relax and enjoy their Down-time with some extra dryness,” concludes Grabham.",MERRYDOWN DRY IS BACK!

Think 100% Irish has been created to encapsulate not only Magners’ impressive 80 year history producing cider from their County Tipperary home, but the Irish way of life, which is as much a part of the cider as the apples grown at the 150 acre onsite orchard.

The new campaign will kick off with a series of targeted online ads, which use every day observations and relatable situations to introduce how you could Think 100% Irish’ and look on the sunny side of life.

For example, you might have a boring office job – but at least you get paid to scroll Facebook. You might be worried you don’t quite ‘measure up’ – but don’t think it’s tiny – it’s fun size!

The adverts show a Magners pint glass which has been filled half way, sitting on a table in an outdoor sunny cider garden. They make light-hearted observations about everyday situations in a glass half full / half empty style.

This creative ties in perfectly with Magners’ sunny outlook and heroes the refreshing drink, and iconic over ice serve Magners is famous for.

Over the coming months, Think 100% Irish will be rolled out to include reactive stunts, experiential and festival activations.

The light-hearted new campaign is set to engage drinkers, showing them the silver lining to any situation, and encourage them to adopt the Irish outlook.

Janette Murray, Brand Manager of Magners UK said: “This is an exciting year for Magners. We wanted to inject some of that twinkley-eyed humour and love of a great laugh that the Irish are famous for. We’d like to encourage cider fans to follow our lead and look for the silver lining in everyday situations.”

“Our quirky new campaign won’t ask drinkers to start hugging trees or strangers in the street in a quest for positive vibes – but it will give them a laugh and help them see that modern life isn’t so bad.”

“We’ll be introducing the campaign to consumers in the coming weeks and taking advantage of every possible opportunity to help drive sales through the tills in both the on and off trade throughout the UK. Magners will also be present at 11 festivals across the country throughout the summer where I’m sure there will be plenty of occasions for consumers to try out their new Magners mindset.”",MAGNERS LAUNCH NEW “THINK 100% IRISH” CAMPAIGN

The company impressed the judges with its “shrewd investments in innovation and branding”. Aston Manor beat competition from six other food and drink businesses after demonstrating its commitment to the region and credentials as an outstanding cider supplier. They will now enter the national awards, Made in the UK, with other regional winners from across the UK.

Aston Manor has been making cider in the Midlands for 35 years. The company has its headquarters and logistics hub in Birmingham, its state-of-the-art pressing facility in Stourport-on-Severn and orchards across Worcestershire and Herefordshire. It has recently invested significantly to expand the business and ensure its manufacturing processes are seamless and environmentally friendly. Further, Aston Manor has committed to planting up to 400,00 new trees in Midlands orchards and in doing so agreed 25-year contracts with farmer and grower partners.

Picking up the award, Justin Way, marketing controller at Aston Manor, said “This is great recognition for Aston Manor, with the judging panel praising our approach to innovation, environmental sustainability and consistent investment in people and manufacturing capability to maintain the highest standards. We look forward to competing with other regional winners at the upcoming Made in the UK awards.”

Aston Manor was also shortlisted in the Manufacturer of The Year for companies with a turnover below £25m category.

The Made in the Midlands awards took place on Thursday 10 May at the Macdonald Burlington Hotel in Birmingham and was hosted by actor, writer and presenter Alexis Conran. The prestigious regional ceremony is now in its seventh year and recognises the innovation and excellence from across the Midlands in nine separate categories.

The introduction of Cornish Orchard’s new premium Dry Cider is bound to get people talking and taste buds tingling.

Founded by Andy Atkinson, Cornish Orchards has been making award-winning ciders from 100% freshly pressed apples since 1999.

Based at Westnorth Manor Farm in Duloe, which is near Looe on the South Cornish Coast, their team of highly passionate cider makers work harmoniously with the seasons to create a range of apple based ciders that are hand-blended, fermented and matured throughout the winter months right here on the farm.

Consumers today look for brands that offer more in in terms of quality and provenance and are willing to pay higher prices for these products.

Cornish Orchards noticed a gap in the market for a premium cider that met the taste requirements of a traditional cider drinker, yet had an appeal to your modern day cider drinker.

Using their passion for cider making, the team set out to create an exceptional and refined dry cider with a typical Westcountry Character which was the perfect way to bridge that gap.

The dry cider is made from a blend of bittersweet and dessert apples that have been specially selected for their soft tannins and traditional flavour giving the cider a long dry finish; a perfect choice for those seeking a natural tasting, dry apple cider.

The 5.2% dry cider is currently available in 500ml bottles and 50 Litre keg and has become a premium serve for many restaurants and bars across the Duchy and beyond.

Andy Atkinson, Founder of Cornish Orchards says, “This new Dry Cider meets the fundamental needs of consumers in this ever-evolving marketplace. Cornish Orchards now have this unique premium product that is highly sessionable and can be thoroughly enjoyed all year round. I am excited to see this product take off as I know it will.”

‘The Wonderfulness of Local’ campaign highlights the premium quality of Stowford Press cider, exemplified by the locally-sourced apples used to create every pint. It features comedian Ellie Taylor and adventurer Alastair Humphreys exploring the glorious countryside around Westons’ cider mill in Much Marcle, Herefordshire.

“The key objective of our TV creative was to tap into a brand truth that had the ability to engage consumers emotionally,” explains brand manager Holly Chadwick. “Within this, we know our consumers value premium, local ingredients and provenance, and are actively seeking out experiences over material things.”

“This drove our thinking around the new TV advert. Through the new creative we wanted to find an entertaining and engaging way to communicate the fact that unlike some other ciders, all of the apples used in Stowford Press are grown within just 50 miles of our cider mill.”

“Although Stowford Press is a major national brand in both the on and off-trades, we will always stay true to the local heart of our brand and celebrate the wonderfulness of local.”

The TV ad, which has been produced in 60”, 30” and 10” edits, will premier during Channel 4 and ITV’s prime time Friday night schedules, to be followed by a 10-week campaign which adds further channels including Sky Media and BT Sport and will deliver significant national coverage for the brand.

TV advertising will be supported by a programme of high-profile sponsorships, consumer PR, on-trade and in-store customer marketing, blogger activation and social media activity, all celebrating the wonderfulness of local and adding up to the biggest marketing package ever put behind Stowford Press.

The new TV commercials were created and produced by Red Bee and directed by Ollie Parsons. Alongside the main Stowford Press apple variant, they also feature Stowford Press Mixed Berries cider which was launched in the on-trade in March this year.

“As we predicted at the time,” says Chadwick, “Stowford Press Mixed Berries has had a rapturous reception from the trade and consumers alike. This new campaign will highlight the quality of our cider and will bring the Stowford Press brand to even more people’s attention.”",STOWFORD PRESS CELEBRATES ‘THE WONDERFULNESS OF LOCAL’

The premium cider brand’s first large-scale partnership will give Mortimer’s Orchard exclusive pouring rights at a series of high-profile tournaments including the Fever-Tree Championships held at The Queen’s Club, Birmingham Classic, Eastbourne International and Nottingham Open.

Taking to the court from April, the partnership with the LTA will drive further awareness and trial of Mortimer’s Orchard amongst tens of thousands of tennis fans at tournaments throughout the summer.

It will also feature the launch of the inaugural Mortimer’s Orchard Cider Bar at the Fever-Tree Championships, where tournament-goers will be able to enjoy the brand’s Original and English Berry offerings, both of which provide lasting refreshment with a light, sparkling finish.

“The quintessentially British nature of the LTA brand strongly reflects the Mortimer’s Orchard positioning as an expertly balanced, premium cider made with 100% fresh English apple juice,” explains Sally McKinnon, Head of Brands at Westons Cider.

“Summer sports and a cold pint of cider go hand-in-hand and, as such a well-established symbol of British summer time, the LTA is a clear fit with the Mortimer’s Orchard brand. The partnership is the ideal platform to reach even more Mortimer’s Orchard target consumers as they enjoy a day of sport.”

“We’re thrilled to be embarking on a partnership with Mortimer’s Orchard this summer,” adds James Mercer, Commercial Director at the LTA. “For many of our fans, come rain or shine a day out at the tennis just isn’t complete without a refreshing beverage in hand. With such a strong British heritage, Mortimer’s Orchard is the perfect cider for us.”

Richard Morgan-Jones, a Herefordshire based apple grower, has been given a special award and praised by Thatchers Cider for the exceptional quality of apples he produces.

Richard, who has followed in his father’s footsteps in growing and supplying apples to Thatchers, was presented with the Thatchers Apple Grower of the Year award at the cidermaker’s annual Wassail celebrations.

Richard supplies seven different apple varieties to Thatchers, both bittersweet and dessert – from Katy early in the season, through to Yarlington Mill as one of the last to be harvested.

Richard Johnson, chief cidermaker at Thatchers says, “Richard has put in an enormous amount of effort throughout the growing and harvest season to ensure his apples are the highest quality. In fact, this last harvest he supplied us with 101 trailer loads of fruit, which were all fantastic quality from September through to November. That is a real achievement over such a large harvest.

“Richard’s dedication to quality matches our own and truly reflects our ethos that the best cider starts in the orchard.”

Thatchers presents the award each year to recognise the commitment to quality that the growers have demonstrated when supplying fruit into the Thatchers cider mill.

Thatchers has over 500 acres of its own orchard in and around its cider mill at Myrtle Farm in Somerset, as well as a number of growers throughout the West Country.

“Climate and soil – as well as the expertise of the grower – all play their part in producing top quality apples for cidermaking,” continues Richard Johnson. “As a cidermaker we have our favourite apple varieties to suit our own style of ciders – Richard Morgan-Jones supplies us with Katy, which is pressed into our single variety cider of the same name; newer apple varieties such as Gilly and Jane, and much-loved bittersweet varieties Dabinett and Yarlington Mill.

“We test every batch of apples for quality that arrive at Myrtle Farm during harvest and reward our growers accordingly. This year Richard Morgan-Jones excelled, and we are very happy that he’s our Apple Grower of the Year.”",THATCHERS APPLE GROWER OF THE YEAR IS RICHARD MORGAN-JONES

Expected to be seen over 30 million times in live rugby during the first two months of the campaign alone, and in total seen by ¾ of the adult population, the TV commercial’s message to viewers is that Thatchers is totally uncompromising about the quality of its cider – if something’s not perfect, it’s useless. You wouldn’t settle for a race car that could almost race – so why buy a cider that’s almost perfect, reinforcing the link between quality and perfection of Thatchers.

The 30 second Race Car commercial will be first seen on ITV during the Six Nations Rugby England Vs Ireland match on 2nd February at half time. It will then be shown from February through to September on ITV, Channel 4 and Multichannel, during this year’s top sporting events and TV moments. Hero spots will include Six Nations Rugby, The Grand National, Monaco Grand Prix, Cricket World Cup, Game of Thrones, Great British Bake Off, and the Women’s Football World Cup.

The ad will be included in a VOD (video on demand) campaign running April to July, and also runs in cinema during July and August, including the silver spot in the hotly anticipated new Quentin Tarantino Film – Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, starring amongst others Brad Pitt, Leonardo di Caprio and Margot Robbie.

Yvonne Flannery, Head of Brands at Thatchers Cider comments, “This new phase of our award-winning campaign features our popular Spokesperson, as well as cameos from Martin Thatcher and our chief cidermaker Richard Johnson. Filmed in iconic West Country locations, it retains a gentle, warm-hearted yet funny tone, and leaves the viewer with no doubt as to the taste and quality of Thatchers ciders – what cider’s supposed to taste like.

“Following from our Hot Air Balloon commercial, which we know resonated strongly with viewers on enjoyment and memorability*, Race Car creates a long-term campaign for Thatchers, filmed in the same, sunny photographic style, and featuring familiar faces, music and scenery to support brand recognition.

“Of course, the notion that the race car is going so slow is clearly ridiculous, as was the low flying hot air balloon in the first of the ad series. This is a humorous ad that will appeal to a wide audience and introduce new customers to our brand.”

Joint London are the creative agency behind the campaign for Thatchers, with Bray Leino advising on media buying. The film was directed by Declan Lowney, who has shot numerous commercials for some of the world’s biggest brands. He is also a top television comedy director, with Father Ted, Little Britain and Moone Boy amongst his credits.

The TV campaign is accompanied by a new series of short films for digital channels, also featuring the Thatchers’ Spokesperson, who finds himself in humorous situations at Thatchers Myrtle Farm, always highlighting the Thatchers family of ciders and their great taste characteristics – Thatchers Gold, Haze, Vintage and Katy.

2019 will be another important year for the growth of the Thatchers brand, with planned marketing activity including experiential, sponsorships, events and festivals. The family-run Somerset cidermaker is continually supporting and growing its brands to help drive people into the cider category, and is one of the biggest investors in marketing amongst UK cidermakers.

With its focus on apple cider, Thatchers is driving the apple cider category across both on and off trades with its Gold and Haze ciders. Thatchers Gold is the no 2 canned apple cider (by value)* in the off trade and Thatchers Haze is the No 1 cloudy cider. In the on trade Thatchers Haze is the fastest growing cider in the top ten draught ciders**, and Gold has the best rate of sale of all draught apple ciders.

Vineyard owners are raising a glass to HM Revenue & Customs over new rules that allow them to pass on land where grapes — or apples for cider — are grown, free of inheritance tax.

In an update to its guidance notes on what constitutes agricultural use of land for inheritance tax purposes, the tax office has extended its definition of food to include fruit used to make wines and ciders. This means that the value of the land will be up to 100 per cent tax-free when left in an estate.

Richard Crane, the head of the farms and estates team at BKL, an accountancy firm, says: “This may be seen as a significant extension to tax-planning opportunities because it will become widely known that land for producing wine and cider is eligible for agricultural property relief. The relief is not limited to land within the UK but extends throughout the European Economic Area, which could be an attraction for investors looking to reduce their inheritance tax liabilities while having the pleasure of owning a vineyard.”

BKL says that although only grapes and apples for cider are mentioned specifically by HMRC, a case could be made for other fruit, such as pears used to make perry.

The British wine industry, which primarily produces sparkling white wines, is growing rapidly. It is being boosted by a warming climate that is hitting the wine-growing sweet spot of an average of 14C throughout the April to October growing season, and a higher profile for British products worldwide.

The amount of British land planted with vines has increased 150 per cent in the past ten years and tripled since 2000, according to Wine GB, the national association for the English and Welsh wine industry. Production is predicted to reach 40 million bottles by 2040.

The market in British wines began to take off in 2003 when Nyetimber, which owns vineyards in Sussex, Hampshire and Kent, beat some of the best known champagnes in taste tests. Since then French champagne houses Taittinger and Pommery have invested in British vineyards.

Ed Mansel Lewis, the head of the viticulture group at Strutt & Parker, an estate agency, says: “These two nods of approval have given the UK credibility as a new-world wine- producing region.”

Those keen to invest in the industry should be aware that it takes time for your assets to mature. If you planted your first vines this spring it wouldn’t be until 2023 that your vineyard would have a viable harvest and another two years before you had any wine to sell. The best vineyard land sells for between £13,000 and £15,000 an acre, compared with between £8,000 and £9,000 for arable land. The minimum plot size needed is ten acres.

Simon Robinson, the owner of Hattingley Valley winery and chairman of Wine GB, says he knows of good vine land trading for up to £20,000 an acre and that it can fetch 50 per cent to 75 per cent more than other farm land.

“A lot of vines are being planted in Britain, 2.5 million are expected over the next year. The issue is where are all those grapes going to go?,” Robinson says.

A vineyard owner could sell their grapes to the larger producers for roughly £2,000 a tonne depending on the quality (you can expect about three tonnes of grapes an acre). They could rent out the land, or try to make the wine themselves.

However, with harvests dependent on the weather there is the risk that they could earn nothing in a bad year.

In a good year, like last year, Lewis cautions that commercial wineries were so overloaded with fruit that they turned away grapes from smaller growers.

Release to coincide with launch of a novel new Cider using Pioneering On-Leaf Fermentation Method.

Devon cider makers Sandford Orchards unveiled their new Fine Cider Range today, involving a pioneering new technique which has its roots both in winemaking and ancient cider production. Sandford Orchards’ new single variety Yarlington Mill cider is produced using ‘on leaf’ fermentation, a concept inspired by whole-bunch fermentation found in modern winemaking. This is the first time this method of fermentation has been used to produce a cider.

The idea of adding fresh apple leaves to fermentation first came to Barny Butterfield, owner of Sandford Orchards, after reading yeast trial results from the 1900s. Building on the concept, Barny added fresh apple leaves from a Sweet Alford tree to a batch of single variety Yarlington Mill juice at harvest. “I wanted to see if the leaves had an impact on the aromatics of the juice, as hinted in the trial results” explained Barny, “and we were blown away by the results.” Blind tastings of the juice have produced a wide range of comments pronouncing the juice “fresher and fruiter, with extra zing”.

To add strength to the findings Sandford Orchards called on their connections with the University of Exeter mycology department. Inspired by the taste findings, the team are currently working on profiling the metabolic pathway of the microbes present in the on-leaf fermentation, alongside other research including gene sequencing and microbiome comparison. “We are delighted to be working alongside Sandford Orchards on this project” commented Dr Jane Usher, University of Exeter. “The on-leaf fermentation produces a profoundly more impressive bouquet with increased complexity and subtlety, I am optimistic that our research will help us to understand the reasons behind it”.

A small release of 100 cases of the first batch on Yarlington Mill – On-leaf is now available alongside Tremletts Bitter, Single Variety Cider, the second cider in Sandford Orchards’ Fine Cider Range, which uses natural yeasts found in the Cider Works, Sandford Orchards’ home, and a working cider works since 1932.
