The team behind London-based wine bar P Franco and restaurant Bright are preparing to open their third venture, proffering Japanese-inspired dishes paired with natural wine.

Influenced by yakitori, a Japanese type of speared chicken, the menu centres around skewers and broths and features grilled chicken wings, hearts and thighs from Leicestershire based Fosse Meadows with spicy Japanese inspired seasonings.
Located on the former site of Magnus Reid’s Legs on Morning Lane in Hackney, owner Phil Bracey says Peg will be all bar seating with “a focus on keeping prices down, small team, simple food, and a record player”.  The interior’s theme is recycling, with tabletops made from salvaged yogurt pots.
Peg brings P Franco and Bright together on two menu boards, the new grills on one and the familiar small plates of Bright on the other.
Head chef Byron Fini is supported by executive chef William Reid with a focus on carefully selected produce. Ingredients will be sourced from producers including those used by Brat, Koya and The Clove Club such as Flourish Produce, Namayasai Farm and Kernow Sashimi.
P Franco which opened in 2014 and Bright, which opened last year, are famed for their natural wine list.  A self-professed “wine geek”, Bracey’s wine lists have included pét-nats, reds, whites and orange wines such as Claude Cortois’s Racine and Cédric Garreau’s Gar’o’Vin.
Peg’s wine list promises to follow this trend. The restaurant will open on 20 February.

As WSET marks its 50th anniversary, db brought together a panel of WSET Diploma graduates who have gone on to forge stellar careers to reflect on how studying for this qualification gave them a firm foundation in the wine trade.
At the start of the year, in the heart of London, a discussion took place called Reflections from the Grand Masters. Organised by the drinks business and hosted by the Wine & Spirit Education Trust (WSET), it marked the launch of this institution’s 50th anniversary celebrations.
The discussion aimed to look at the evolving role of wine and spirit education in the past five decades, how WSET has influenced these changes and how it continues to inspire future generations of trade professionals. A selection of industry grand masters were invited to take part in the discussion to share their WSET experience in its first 50 years, and discuss the value of education.
Among them was someone awarded an OBE, another with an MBE, along with a Master Sommelier, and three Masters of Wine – four if one included me (I was enlisted to moderate the discussion). All in all there were eight WSET Diploma graduates.
In terms of positions in the trade, our panellists (see boxout) comprised: the world’s most respected wine writer; the UK’s most experienced wine retailer; the leading figureheads in wine importing, wine distributing, generic marketing and brand development, as well as wine waiting, with our sole Master Sommelier overseeing the globe’s best place to drink wine – 67 Pall Mall.
Helping to fuel the discussion was Ian Harris, who has led WSET for almost 17 years, and turned this London-headquartered education provider into a truly global institution, while picking up an MBE in the process. Although WSET was founded in October 1969, he traced formal wine education back to 1908, when writer and merchant André Simon established the Wine Trade Club, which ran lectures for professionals until 1955, when the Wine and Spirit Association took over.
Government initiative
WSET was set up in 1969 as a result of a government training initiative to improve the country’s economic performance through education (1964 Industrial Training Act).
Half a century later, Harris said the major changes to WSET had been the development of a progressive pathway to the diploma, the introduction of a business course, and, most significantly, a hugely increased international reach. “82% of our students now study in markets outside of the UK,” he said, adding that the first international course was run in 1977 in Toronto, for the Liquor Control Board of Ontario.
The scale of WSET’s student body has also swelled. “In the past 12 months, nearly 100,000 people have studied with WSET somewhere in the world,” said Harris.
Looking forward, he stressed how important it was that WSET stayed relevant to changing industry and consumer needs. He said WSET is regularly updating all courses to ensure they are current and relevant to jobs, and has recently redesigned the suite of qualifications to reflect three distinct subject streams: wine, spirits and saké.
The new Level 4 Diploma in Wines will be available from August, and a Level 3 Spirits qualification will launch at the same time. He added that the expansion of online learning in response to the changing learning habits and expectations of WSET’s customers is also a priority.
As for the role of education in the wine business, Harris was clear that the benefits were commercial. “Education shouldn’t just be about product knowledge, but it should be a driver of profit. The more people know about the product, the more they will be prepared to spend,” he concluded.
Looking back to the early days of WSET was the much-admired and outspoken former supermarket wine buyer Allan Cheesman, who gained his diploma in 1975, three years after he had joined J Sainsbury. Having highlighted a very different wine industry in the UK in the 1970s – “when one third of all wine sales were German, and Italy didn’t really exist” – he said WSET back then, like today, “was a given. There was little in the way of options, but you studied with WSET to benefit your normal business life,” he said.
Three years after Cheesman had gained his diploma, Jancis Robinson MW passed hers. As a diploma graduate in 1978, it emerged that the celebrated wine writer had just beaten Ian Harris, who picked up the qualification in 1980. For Robinson, success with the WSET Diploma led her to become a Master of Wine. She pointed out that WSET had taken her on an educational journey that proved to her peers that wine was serious topic. “When I graduated in the early ’70s wine was seen as an utterly frivolous subject, and my friends would have said it was a waste of an Oxford education,” she said.
To continue in chronological order, the next attendee of this roundtable to gain the diploma was Laura Jewell MW, regional director for the UK and Europe at Wine Australia, and former head of wine product development at Tesco, who obtained the qualification in 1987. Like Robinson, the diploma meant she was “taken seriously”, while “opening up the world in terms of product knowledge and the wider skills of being a buyer”, as well as being a stepping stone, again like Robinson, to becoming a Master of Wine.
Moving into this century, Hatch Mansfield sales director Ben Knollys passed the diploma in 2002, a qualification he embarked on because he was encouraged by his employers – who sponsored it – but also because of his belief that “if you are going to sell the product then you’ve got to really understand it”. It was also a prerequisite for his current job at Hatch Mansfield.
Also present at the discussion was Ben Smith, head of corporate communications for Concha y Toro UK, who, like Knollys, gained the diploma in 2002. Describing the qualification as “necessary and enjoyable”, he also stressed that it taught him how to taste. “That’s the key part that WSET covers so well.”
Next, Jon Pepper MW – CEO at Enotria & Coe – achieved the diploma in 2007 (like me). Impressively, at this time he wasn’t working in the wine industry, but in “beauty”, with a senior role at L’Oréal. Searching for a job in wine marketing, he said that his position at L’Oréal would normally “open lots of doors”, but, when it came to the wine trade “it didn’t really help at all”. As a result, he gained the diploma “as fast as I could”, because “I wanted a structured formal qualification, so that as a non-wine-trade person I could be taken seriously”.
And, finally, Ronan Sayburn MS, who comes last in this, because, although he is an ardent supporter of WSET, never completed the diploma. Having started the course in the 1990s, when he was a sommelier at Le Manoir Aux Quat’Saisons, he surprised the attendees by confessing that after “an accident with a sash window, I never actually got it”.
Looking more deeply into the power of WSET qualifications, Robinson admitted that not only does such formal wine education ensure that you “cover the ground”, but also learn about “subjects you may not naturally be the most interested in”. Jewell drew attention to WSET’s role in expanding one’s contact base. “I was living and working in Scotland [when I did the diploma] so it gave me an entrée in to the wine trade in London, and I met so many amazing people in the trade.”
Meanwhile, Sayburn was driven to study with WSET because “I hated not knowing”, as well as needing to answer questions from his customers, and “WSET is the best and most organised way to improve your knowledge.” It’s why, he explained, “everyone at 67 Pall Mall is put through WSET Level 2, including the kitchen staff”. For Pepper, such knowledge is vital for gaining respect among the producers. “The world of wine is getting smaller and smaller while at the same time it is broadening out; winemakers are travelling the world to do vintages in their off-season, so, for example, you have to be able to discuss the intricacies of Burgundy if you want to be able to engage with a New Zealand Pinot producer.”
Studying through WSET affected our panellists on a more personal level too. For Robinson, it gave her a first taste of Gewürztraminer, which she described as “an eye-opener; it’s so memorable that once I’d tasted it, I thought ‘hooray, that’s one grape I would probably recognise blind’”.
Sayburn recalled WSET’s introduction to the flavours imparted by ageing wine in oak barrels. “I remember distinguishing vanilla, cream, nuts and thinking, gosh, it’s not all bullshit – I had been brought up in Scarborough, where there was a lack of fine wine, so I had studied what they tasted like, but had never tried them.”
A shared understanding
As the discussion came to an end, it was time to hone in on the benefits of education for commercial success in the trade. Jewell stressed how important product knowledge was for buyers in this sector.
“Many a Champagne promotion [in supermarkets] has been put in peril because the buyer has not understood the process of production; the fact it has to be disgorged and dosed before it can be shipped.”
WSET, with its systematic approach to tasting, has created “a more homogenised way of talking about wine”, says Pepper. “This is important with a subject like wine, which is so emotive and widely panned, because it enables wine professionals around the world to talk a common language,” he added.
For Sayburn, product knowledge in the restaurant sector is vital. “If you work in hospitality and the wine offer is done badly, then your customers won’t trade up or buy a second bottle, and that can make the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful business,” he stated.
And educating consumers is also key for the sustainability of the wine trade. “We have people in this country spending £3 on a mediocre cup of coffee, but whingeing about a bottle of wine at £6… the only way for the industry to make more margin is for the consumer to spend more – we can’t keep cutting costs in the vineyard or packaging – and it is only through education that the consumer will trade up,” said Harris.
As a final point, such people should be attracted to WSET because of the positive feelings created through learning, according to Robinson. She said: “There is a high proportion of members of jancisrobinson.com who are doing a WSET course, and they all seem to love it. I don’t exercise as much as I should, but people talk about endorphins from exercise, and I think there is a mental counterpart: the joy of learning. It gives you a high.”
WSET has played an instrumental role in the careers of some of the wine trade’s most influential personalities. It has also played an important role in the success of the UK wine and spirits trade, offering the only wine and spirits qualifications that cross global boundaries and unify markets. It has educated more than 500,000 people about wine globally, and created a solid base of informed consumers which is vital for the sustained success of this trade. According to our grand masters, WSET qualifications continue to be the foundation stone of a successful career in the wine and spirits trade. And, in WSET’s 50th year, that’s definitely one more reason to celebrate.

Swansea-based Lewis Pie and Pasty Co. has teamed up with Coles Brewery and Distillery in Llanddarog to produce a gin made from leftover bread.
The Welsh businesses have joined a growing number of other drinks producers concocting sustainable ways in which to use up food waste.
The aptly-named bakery gin is produced at Coles Distillery in Llanddarog, Carmarthen using day-old bread from Lewis Pie and Pasty Co. The bread is turned into beer which is then distilled to make the neutral base spirit, before re-distilling and adding botanicals to make gin.
The Lewis bakery website notes: “When our bakery makes bread in the middle of the night we often have to use a best guess on quantity and slightly overproduce to make sure we don’t short supply our customers. This can generate waste. Any waste that can’t be sold is often thrown away and that makes us upset! Thats where Coles family Brewery come in! They told us they could make gin from bread.”
Described as “light, clean and fresh” the gin is flavoured with juniper and citrus and bottled at 37.5% ABV.
It is estimated that the UK wastes 900,000 tonnes of bread each year, equating to 44% of the total that is produced.
In 2016, Toast Ale began making beer from leftover bread from London’s bakeries and delis. The brewer has since expanded and is now sold across the UK, most recently achieving listings at Co-op stores.
Meanwhile in April last year, Suffolk brewer Adnams turned its hand to brewing with bread, producing three beers for UK retailer Marks & Spencer using surplus crusts leftover from the store’s sandwich production.
Cereal giant Kellogg’s and Salford-based brewery Seven Bro7hers also recently teamed up to create a beer made with cornflakes that were either too big, too small or overcooked to make it through quality control.

A luxury touring company and an underwater research firm have organised a dive to the wreck of the Titanic followed by a 10-course meal inspired by the ship’s original menu, including Champagne from 1907.
The Titanic. Image: Wiki.
Cookson Adventures have teamed up with Oceangate to create the unusual travel package, which is scheduled to take place in July 2019.
Nine people are making the journey to the location in the Atlantic, south of Newfoundland, where the ill-fated cruise-liner sunk, after striking an iceberg on its voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912.
The travellers will then accompany researchers and scientists on board Titan, the only non-government owned manned submersible vessel, capable of reaching depths of 4,000 metres.
Guests will help the team in navigating to the wreck, which is located more than 3,700 metres underwater, and assist with sonar mapping and photography. The Titan will explore the Titanic’s deck, its bridge, radio room and famous first class staircase.
The experience concludes with a 10-course meal back on land, which is based on the vessel’s original menu served in the first class deck on 14 April, the night before the vessel sunk.
Among the dishes known to have been offered on the day are oysters, Consommé Olga (made with beef stock and garnished with scallops); salmon, mousseline sauce and cucumber; Filet Mignons Lili (filet mignon topped with seared foie gras and truffle, with potatoes and a Cognac, Madeira and red wine sauce); Calvados-glazed roast duck with apple sauce; peaches in Chartreuse jelly and chocolate eclairs with French vanilla cream.
This will be accompanied by a bottle of 1907 Heidsieck Gout Champagne, the vintage known to have been consumed on board the Titanic. Obtained from supplier Wine Source, the bottle was salvaged from the wreck of Swedish schooner sunk by a German submarine in 1916.
This expedition, which is the first manned trip since 2005, could be one of the last to take place. A study in 2016, revealed that the ship, which is badly rusted, could be disintegrate within 15 to 20 years.
Cookson did not disclose the price of the trip, however when Oceangate last spoke about the project in December last year, a price of $105,129 (£82,890), was quoted. This, it said, was the equivalent cost of first-class passage on the Titanic, adjusted for inflation.
The Titanic disaster claimed the lives of over 1,500 people. The wreck was eventually discovered by Robert Ballard in a US military mission in 1985.

Alexandre Ricard, chairman and CEO of Pernod Ricard, has revealed that he plans to continue to “dispose” of brands that “no longer fit” within the drinks giant’s portfolio, following on from the sale of Argentine wine brand Graffigna last month.
Alexandre Ricard is pursuing value over volume sales when it comes to wine
Speaking to the press at Gong Bar inside The Shard in London Bridge today following the release of the company’s H1 FY19 results, Ricard said:
“We sold our Argentine wine brand Graffigna to the VSPT group last month as part of our plan to strip back our volume driven listings that focus on discounting.
“We are committed to our value approach and will continue to dispose of brands that no longer have a strategic fit within our wine portfolio.
“Our wine volume sales are down by 8% due to our value focused strategy, which we’re not afraid of pursuing. Value sales are growing ahead of volume sales at the moment.
“Wine’s performance for H1 2019 has been negatively over-exaggerated, as Campo Viejo’s volume sales were up by 23% this time last year.
“We’re trying to strike the right balance between investments that drive top line growth and profitability.”
Pernod Ricard’s wine portfolio includes brands like Australia’s Jacob’s Creek, Rioja giant Campo Viejo and boutique brand Ysios, New Zealand brands Brancott Estate, Stoneleigh and Church Road, and California brand Kenwood.
In terms of Pernod Ricard’s three-year strategic plan, Ricard told the press that the firm had “accomplished what we set out to do” with “very strong” first half results for the 2019 financial year “boosted by an early Chinese New Year”.
“Our aim is to grow our profit organically by 6-8% with the help of our four key markets: the US, China, India and global travel retail.
“I think we can sustain high single-digit growth in China over time, which will be driven in part by emerging middle class consumers as well as the luxury segment. We have been investing in this second route to market,” Ricard said.
Shooting down speculation of a potential merger with another drinks company, Ricard said: “We have been a consolidator in the industry and I want to reiterate very clearly and specifically that Pernod Ricard is here to stay, and Pernod Ricard is and will remain a consolidator.”
He also revealed that the company was “seriously monitoring” the growing cannabis drinks market.
Pernod Ricard is “seriously monitoring” the cannabis drinks market in the US and Canada
“We are analysing data and observing the market in both the US and Canada. There is no evidence that the legalisation of cannabis will cannibalise premium drinks spirits sales, however it might have an impact on the lower end of the market and beer sales,” Ricard said.
“Cannabis is targeting a consumer need for altered states, which you can get from augmented reality,” he added.
As for Brexit, Ricard said that “from a selfish point of view, if the pound weakens due to Brexit then it will be good for Pernod Ricard.”
Jean-Christophe Coutures, CEO of Chivas Bros, added that the drinks giant had been “preparing for the worst” in case a no deal Brexit becomes a reality.
“We have been preparing for the worst and have been stockpiling dry goods in the UK over the last few months. We’re in a good position to deal with the short-term nightmare of a no deal Brexit but it’s hard to anticipate how the situation will evolve,” he said.
As for the growing no and low alcohol drinks sector, David Haworth, MD of Pernod Ricard UK, believes there is further growth on the horizon.
“Ceder’s has achieved double the volume we expected and we’re anticipating future growth in the no and low alcohol category. Ceder’s performance so far has been extremely positive and there is more opportunity for growth in this space as people are drinking less but don’t want to compromise on flavour.
“The non alcoholic ‘gin’ brand performed unbelievably well over Christmas at places like Bills and I think the no and low trend will start growing in other global markets,” he said.
The drinks giant also unveiled a new flavour innovation today in the form of a blood orange Beefeater gin created by master distiller Desmond Payne based on a 19th century recipe from the Beefeater archives, following on from the successful release of a pink Beefeater gin last year.

New Zealand producers should “take poor quality Sauvignon out of the market” or they risk bringing the whole industry down, according to wine consultant Justin Howard-Sneyd MW.
Wine consultant Justin Howard-Sneyd MW has urged New Zealand producers to take poor quality Sauvignon Blanc out of the market in order to preserve its distinctiveness
Speaking during the second International Sauvignon Blanc Celebration in Marlborough last month, Howard-Sneyd MW told the New Zealand winemakers in attendance:
“Don’t be tempted by short-term financial gain. Take poor quality Sauvignon out of the market, as if it tastes bad it will bring the whole industry down. Supply bulk wine to people you really trust, and don’t let supply exceed demand.
“As soon as there’s a glut as a wine buyer you smell blood under the water and can start playing producers off against each other. Open up in new markets rather than discounting in established markets. Going big in the US really helped in 2008 during the last Sauvignon glut”.
He went on to warn that New Zealand Sauvignon was in danger of becoming a victim of its own success. “Selling New Zealand wine on promotion in the UK is a problem – 65% of all NZ wine sold in Britain is on promotion, which is an alarming figure.
“More New Zealand wine is being sold in bulk to the UK, which is worrying, as there are concerns over the quality of the wine being sold. Own-label supermarket brands are on the rise, which is a concern as it’s leading to a loss of ownership and control for NZ wineries.”
On a more positive note, Howard-Sneyd MW said that New Zealand wine is attracting both affluent consumers and a new generation of drinkers in the UK, particularly due to Kiwi Sauvignon’s refreshing, thirst-quenching character.
“People like New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc because it has flavour intensity, purity, and a mouth-watering capability. With its grapefruit, passion fruit, bell pepper and herbal notes, it’s highly distinctive – everyone can recognise it.
“It would be dangerous if New Zealand Sauvignon starts to lose its distinctiveness due to increasing yields. The inconsistency in quality and style will erode clarity. It will take a long time for New Zealand to lose its brand equity, but if you lose it you’ll never get it back.
“The size of Marlborough and the amount of future Sauvignon plantings in the pipeline is a concern. You need to look after your soils in order to preserve the distinctive flavour of Marlborough Sauvignon and protect its quality,” he said.
He went on to suggest that the best way forward for New Zealand Sauvignon was the premiumisation route. “Premiumisation within the New Zealand Sauvignon category is key through oaked and aged expressions, as producers need to get consumers to trade up.
“The likes of Dog Point, Pegasus Bay and Greywacke don’t fit the mold of the traditional Marlborough Sauvignon style, but there are consumers who typically spend £15 or over on a bottle of wine that will be happy for that explosion of experimentation within the category, as they are looking for interesting and unusual wines,” Howard-Sneyd said.

What or who inspired you to become a sommelier?
To be honest, I kind of slipped into this profession by chance, but there are two people who have inspired me to become a better sommelier. First, there is Ronan Sayburn MS, who got me into the path of Court of Master Sommeliers – he was my first ‘celebrity somm crush’ and is still an inspiration. Also Laurent Richet MS, my mentor and friend. Without him I would not be where I am today.
What’s your favourite part of the job?
Watching the people you work with becoming better, achieving their goals and gaining their qualifications on the way. Watching them grow and become ready for the next challenge makes me proud.
What’s the biggest misconception about the role of a sommelier?
That it’s easy.
What’s your go-to drink at the end of a long day?
I’ve become pretty keen on kombucha recently.
What’s your most embarrassing front-of-house moment?
On my first day of my first job (ever), I dropped a full bowl of warm gravy on the back of a woman. I still remember her very loud and very long scream and the faces of 100 people looking at me.
What bottle sparked your love of wine?
A generic Alsatian Riesling from Trimbach. It didn’t really spark my love for wine but it really opened up my eyes to it. It was the first bottle I had ever bought and read a lot about it in advance as I had this book called Grapes & Wines by Oz Clark. Being a newbie, I didn’t like the wine at all. It was way too acidic, but the flavours and aromas I had read about were all there.
What has been your most memorable wine experience?
1984 La Tâche from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. I was born in the same year, which also happens to be one of the worst vintages in the history of wine. But still, this bottle is by far one of the best I’ve ever had, which says quite a lot about DRC’s commitment to quality.
Which customer habit annoys you the most?
Complaining about a wine after half of the bottle is gone.
Who is your inspiration in the gastronomic world?
I would have to say Sat Bains. I very much admire his dedication to his restaurant, and how he strives for perfection.
What’s your ultimate food-and-wine pairing?
Foie gras with some bread and a bottle of Scharzhofberger Riesling Auslese.
If you weren’t a sommelier, what would you be doing?
I’m fascinated by numbers, equations and statistics so perhaps a mathematician.
Who is the most memorable customer you’ve ever served?
I served the Swedish Royal family at the Nobel Gala dinner. It was a nerve-racking experience, and my hands were shaking the whole time. But it was an amazing experience.
What makes you most proud to be a sommelier in London?
The fact that you become part of a special group who are always there to help and support. It doesn’t matter what your position is, in the end we all have each other’s backs.

Chile’s Emiliana, which claims to be the world’s largest organic winery, has revamped its Adobe wine range, adding an image of a crowing rooster to the label.
The range, which is sold in over 35 countries, is one of the most widely available organic wine lines. The winery has stated that its rebrand aims to “strengthen its attributes of organics and quality”.
Brand manager Paula Millán explained that the winery wanted to “distinguish the characters of the wine.”
She added: “We believe that the illustration of the rooster as the primary element, surrounded by the natural world, represents light and awakening.
“We continue to hear his crowing as the first rays of sunlight appear when we are in the countryside. It also makes an almost-perfect analogy with Emiliana’s own awakening when it decided to transform its vineyards to sustainable agriculture more than 20 years ago.”
Camila Bravo, the brand’s strategic designer, said that the range includes 11 different colours, one for each grape variety used in the Adobe line.
“Every variety is a different colour. This natural range of colours comes the colours of a rooster’s feathers, which ties in very nicely with this project,” she said.
Coinciding with the unveiling of Adobe’s new branding, Emiliana has released its white wines from the 2018 vintage, which will hit the market in August. Its red wines from 2017 will also be rolled out in August and September.
The wines produced in the Adobe range include a Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenere, Merlot, Syrah, Malbec, rosé (made with Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah), Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier, Gewürztraminer and a Pinot Noir.

Champagne house Vranken Pommery has appointed former Matthew Clark manager James Smith to head up its UK national on-trade.
Smith, who will manage the route to market for Vranken champagnes, wine and port brands in the UK, previously spent 11 years at drinks supplier Matthew Clark, where he oversaw the supply into the hotel industry as senior business manager for hotels. Accounts he was responsible for included the Hilton Hotel Group, Jupiter, Q Hotels, BDL and Cotswold Inn. Prior to that he spent five years as a regional account manager for Moet Hennessy covering the South West of England, and four years on the Fine Wine Desk at Bibendum Wine Ltd.
Vranken Pommery’s UK director Sara Hicks said he was a great addition to the team. “James joins us with a wealth of experience and a proven track record in sales and brand management,” she said.
Smith said he was excited to be returning to one of his loves, representing a champagne house in the UK and working with on-trade customers to develop mutual business strategies. “With the addition of rosé wine from Provence and the Camague and port, it’s an exciting portfolio to be going to the market with,” he said.
Pommery is owned by the Vranken-Pommery Monopole Group, and is one of the biggest Champagne groups in the world. Its brands including Pommery, Heidsieck & Co Monopole, Vranken and Champagne Charles Lafitte, as well as ports Rozes and Sao Pedro, and still wine Terras do Grifo and Chateau la Gordonne.
Last year it became the first of the big Champagne houses to release an English sparkling wine, under its new Louis Pommery label after announcing a partnership with Hampshire’s Hattingley Valley in 2014 and buying a 40-hectare site called Pinglestone in Alresford, Hampshire, which is expected to yield its first harvest in 2021.

TV wine presenter and founder of Wine Training, Raul Diaz, says that the demand for formal wine courses in London is booming, and it’s a great sign for the trade.
TV wine presenter and founder of Wine Training, Raul Diaz
During an interview with the drinks business last week, Diaz, who runs a WSET-accredited wine school at the Corinthia Hotel in London, said that he had witnessed a 25% increase in bookings through his company, describing the demand for drinks courses as “very strong”.
Looking back over his career in the London wine trade, he recorded a change among consumers in the capital over the past decade, which was encouraging more people to take formal wine courses, such as the WSET Units 2 and 3.
“One huge different in the last 10 years is the fact that wine has taken greater significance in people’s lives, because, rather than go out to eat, they tend to stay in and entertain at home, and they want to enjoy wine in a social way, and explore wine with their friends at home,” he said.
Having recalled that as many as two thirds of the students he sees are motivated by an urge to better understand the world of wine purely to increase their appreciation of the product in a social setting, he stated, “Wine has a stronger place in people’s lives now.”
He also told db that he believed his wine school offered a particular appeal for professionals, such as lawyers and accountants, because it is “a premium learning experience”, which not only used the upmarket facilities of The Corinthia, but also saw class sizes capped at 15 students, giving the attendees more chance to interact with the teacher.
In addition, he said that he used “very expensive samples”, explaining, “I want the best for my students, and it is important too that they see the typicity of the wine very clearly.”
“For example, if it’s a Rioja Gran Reserva, it will be the best I can get and from an old vintage – I don’t do shortcuts,” he added.
Recalling that he can see the market for wine training in London “growing a lot”, he said that he wanted to tap into this opportunity, and “grow here”.
As a result, he is now running competitions on Facebook on a monthly basis that offer anyone the chance to win a free WSET Level 2 course at his school.
Commenting more generally on what his students enjoy about formal wine training, he said that his receives the most amount of positive feedback for the WSET’s ‘Systematic approach to tasting’.
“It is a revelation, you can see it in their faces, because they discover something that is precise, very simple, and very quickly gives them a knowledge that is practical.”
Such a view was expressed last month when the drinks business staged a roundtable event to celebrate 50 years of the WSET in London.
Speaking at that event, CEO at Enotria & Co, Jon Pepper MW, commented on the power of this approach to sampling wine.
He said, “The WSET, with its systematic approach to tasting, has created a more homogenised way of talking about wine”.
“This is important with a subject like wine, which is so emotive and widely panned, because it enables wine professionals around the world to talk a common language,” he added.

Lalique x Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey

Glassmaker Lalique created an exact replica of a 225-litre barrique made of crystal and filled it with Sauternes to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey.
The premier grand cru classé estate is owned by the CEO of Lalique, Silvio Denz, and the barrel will remain on display at the château alongside other unique pieces including a six litre (imperial) bottle made of crystal.
The wine used to fill the barrel is from the 2013 vintage, the first to be vinified at the château under Denz’s ownership and the whole idea of the concept was to celebrate the estate’s 400th anniversary from 1618 to 2018.
The barrel itself took over two years to make and used a technique known as ‘lost-wax casting’ that was used extensively by Lalique up until 1930 but is rarer today as it is used for objects cast in one go and so requires an immense degree of skill.
As well as being made from crystal, the barrel is ‘bound’ by leather straps designed to imitate the metal hoops that hold a traditional oak barrel together, but these have been secured with cabochons of crystal and the opening of the barrel with a crystal bung.
On the barrel’s front face is an engraving of the ‘Femme et Raisins’ motif that René Lalique created in 1928, originally for the first-class sleeping cars on the Côte d’Azur Pullman Express.

Graham’s Port has announced it is launching a special edition white Port label in order to “engage with new consumers” as the popularity of ‘Port & Tonic’ grows in the UK.
Named ‘Graham’s Blend N°5 White Port’, the release is in response to the growing popularity of white Port and tonic where sales rose a reported 161% between 2012 and 2017.
The Graham’s white Port is a blend of Malvasia Fina and Moscatel Gallega, the former for its freshness, the latter for its aromatics.
Hand picked and cold fermented in small batches, the wine is medium dry and bottled three months after the harvest.
It is designed to be drunk young.
Production is still very limited (just 6,000 bottles) and for now is only to be available in the UK.
The packaging of the wine (pictured) is also a “departure” from the usual Graham’s style, deliberately so as it is designed to appeal to drinkers who are not normally Port drinkers.
Fashion illustrator António Soares who has previously collaborated with Fendi, Karl Lagerfeld and Chanel drew the art for the bottle.
Design manager for Symington Family Estates, Alexandra Sousa Ribeiro, said: “Our design concept aimed to transmit the aromatic fresh profile of the wine – white grapes, lime, peaches, honey – while connecting it with mint and lemon, the garnish associated with Port and Tonic. António Soares, who is known for his strong use of colour, was invited to use his artistic interpretation to create the organic elements for the bottle illustration.”
Charlotte Symington, marketing manager at Symington Family Estates, added: “Following the huge success of the Graham’s Aged Tawny Ports in clear glass bottles, we felt it was time create a new take on white port, having seen it grow in reputation over the last few years.
“We wanted Graham’s Blend Nº5 White Port to be immediate and accessible to a younger generation of port drinkers. The presentation is something completely new for the port trade and we’re excited to see how consumers react.”

UK sales of beer rose to their highest level in 45 years last year, the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) has said, driven by last year’s good weather and the World Cup .
Total sales of beer across the on- and off-trade were up 2.6% on the previous year, according to the British Beer & Pub Association (BBPA)’s 2018 Beer Barometer, marking the biggest year-on-year sales growth of beer in 45 years.
There were strong off-trade sales of 4.7%, while on-trade sales recovering well from a shaky start to the year to rise 0.1% overall on 2017.
The first quarter of the year saw beer sales fall -1.7% compared to the previous year, before improving in the second and thirds quarter, with sales up 3.6% and 4.4% respectively. This was driven largely by last summer’s good weather and the unexpected success of the England football team at the World Cup, it said. The growth continued in the final quarter, rising 3.1% – the first time Q4 beer sales grew in the on-trade since 2011 – which the BBPA attributed to the “immediate impact” of the Chancellor’s decision to freeze beer duty at his Budget in November.
The BBPA said that although the World Cup and the good weather provided welcome boosts to pubs this year, leading to a notable increase in beer sales, it could not be relied upon to boost sales.  “It only comes around once every four years. This means pubs cannot rely on it for growth,” it said.
Brigid Simmonds, Chief Executive of British Beer & Pub Association, said it had been a good year for beer and pubs.
“Considering the heavy cost burdens the industry faces from high beer duty, business rates and rising costs in general, it’s great to see beer sales doing the best they have for some years,” she said.
She said the Chancellor’s decision to freeze beer tax in the 2018 Autumn Budget was having immediate impact.
“This shows just how important reducing the beer tax burden is to boosting sales of beer and helping pubs with their footfall,” she said. “As the UK’s alcoholic drink of choice, which continues to have a much bigger, positive impact on the UK economy than any other drink, it is important that beer continues to do well and that the Chancellor continues to support pubs.”

“In our ever-evolving industry, any brand that stands still and does not move with the times risks becoming irrelevant and getting left behind,” she said.
“We recognised the need for an identity that better communicated exactly who we are and what we do,” Barlow added, before commenting, “I bring 30 plus years of wine and drinks trade experience to my company, but it’s not just about me – everything we do is a collaboration: both within our team and more importantly, with our clients. “
Speaking specifically about the new name for her company, she said, “This ‘going beyond the label’ really is our USP: Barlow & Co – think of it as ‘co’ for collaboration and ‘co’ for our company teamwork.”

The Scotch Whisky Association has won a six-year battle to stop a German distillery from using the term ‘Glen’ on its bottles, calling it “misleading” to the consumer and implies a Scottish origin and infringes upon its protected status.
The SWA launched legal action against German distillery Waldhorn in 2013, specifically against its single malt Glen Buchenbach.
The SWA launched legal action against German distillery Waldhorn in Berglen, near Stuttgart, in 2013, specifically against its single malt Glen Buchenbach.
The German producer, from Baden-Württemberg in the south of the country, makes a number of products including gin and traditional German ‘brand’ of various types.
It also makes a ‘whisky’ – with the Scottish spelling – named after the nearby Buchenbachtal in Swabia. ‘Tal’ in German means ‘valley’ and, as the distillery explains on its website, ‘glen’ is the Gaelic word for valley which is why the whisky has been named ‘Glen Buchenbach Swabian ’.
The SWA argued that the product could confuse consumers and “mislead them as to the true origin of the whisky”.
Previously, an EU court said it would continue to use the name, after advocate general, Henrik Saugmansgaard Øe, ruled that ‘glen’, while Gaelic in origin, did not evoke Scotland to the point that EU law had been broken, pointing out that many Irish and Canadian whiskies also use the term on their labels.
However now a court in Hamburg has ruled in the SWA’s favour, ordering the distillery to change the name of the whisky as it breached the geographical indication of Scotch. The inclusion of the word “glen” in the branding could make consumers believe it was produced in Scotland, the court ruled.
Alan Park, SWA’s director of legal affairs, said: “The SWA has consistently taken action in our global markets to prevent the use of Scottish indications of origin on whisky which is not Scotch Whisky. This is vital to protecting Scotland’s national drink and is a deterrent to those who seek to take advantage of the quality reputation of Scotch Whisky and potentially mislead consumers.
“Courts across many jurisdictions have ruled that names, such as “Highland” and “Glen”, and images, such as bagpipers, are so strongly associated with Scotland and Scotch Whisky that their use on whisky of another origin is misleading.
“Our case against Glen Buchenbach presented clear and compelling evidence to the court that ‘Glen’ is strongly associated with Scotland and Scotch Whisky, and the only reason to use ‘Glen’ for a German whisky is because of its undoubted association with Scotch Whisky.
“We are pleased with the court’s decision that the use of Glen on a German whisky is misleading.”
There was a similar case in 2009 when the SWA challenged a Canadian distillery over a whisky called ‘Glen Breton’. In that instance a Canadian court ruled that the name did not create the impression the product was from Scotland.

Another Central Otago winery in New Zealand has been put up for sale, following the NZ$52 million sale of Mt. Difficulty to the US-based Foley Family Wines.
Carrick vineyards in Bannockburn, Central Otago
The Carrick estate comprises a certified-organic vineyard, winery, cellar door and 70-seat restaurant in Bannockburn, and is for sale by tender via premium real estate brand New Zealand Sotheby’s International Realty.
It is a reluctant sale by Auckland-based vendor Elizabeth Zhong, who has decided to “pursue other business interests”, according to a press release announcing the sale.
“It was a really hard decision to sell Carrick, as it’s my dream vineyard,” she said. “I love it because it’s purely organic. I’m passionate about protecting the environment and passing it on to the next generation in a better state than what it was. Owning Carrick has been really rewarding because the entire team at Carrick has been doing their best with the land, and as a result we’re producing some of the best quality organic wines New Zealand offers.”
The estate covers 34 hectares – of which 24ha is planted with Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay, Riesling and Sauvignon Blanc – as well as accommodation, which includes three luxury residences with a combined total of 12 bedrooms and 7 bathrooms suitable for guest accommodation.
“Carrick is the jewel in the crown in Bannockburn – it is simply a stunning vineyard that produces globally-renowned organic wine,” said New Zealand Sotheby’s International Realty senior associate and vineyard sales specialist David Penrose.
“It is definitely a unique opportunity to be able to secure a vineyard of this size, with such potential across so many aspects of the business.”

HMRC has updated its guidelines to now allow owners of vineyards and cider apple orchards in the UK to pass on land without inheritance tax.," 11th February, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/02/hmrc-announces-tax-break-for-vineyard-and-cider-orchard-owners/,"11th February, 2019

HMRC has updated its guidelines to now allow owners of vineyards and cider apple orchards in the UK to pass on land without inheritance tax.

As reported by The Times, HMRC has updated its definition of what constitutes agricultural use of land in relation to inheritance tax. The definition now includes the production of fruit used to make wine and cider, meaning that vineyards and orchards now qualify for agricultural property relief.
As a result, the value of the land will be up to 100% tax-free when left as part of an estate, according to the paper. 
This follows news revealing that the area under vine in Great Britain has increased by 160% in the past 10 years to reach 7,000 acres (2,888ha), according to trade organisation WineGB.
In recent years there has been an ambitious vine planting programme in England and Wales with 1.6 million vines were planted last year, with a further 2 million expected in 2019.
WineGB states that it, in line with current trends, it projects that volumes will increase to some 40m bottles per annum by 2040. By the same year, it expects wine tourism to generate an additional revenue of £658 million a year, with an increase in employment in the sector from 2,000 to 24,000.
With this increase in production and cultivation, there is a concern as to how the wine will get produced.
Speaking to the Times, Simon Robinson, owner of Hampshire’s Hattingley Valley winery and chairman of WineGB, revealed that he’d seen good vine land trading for up to £20,000 an acre, meaning that it can achieve 50-75% more than other types of agricultural land.
“The issue is where are all those grapes going to go,” he added.
Speaking to the drinks business last year, co-owner of Simpsons Wine Estate, Ruth Simpson, also highlighted the same issue. With no connection to Kent, Ruth and her husband Charles saw land advertised specifically for its vine growing potential in the county.
Indeed their agents, Strutt & Parker, were the first in the UK to market a substantial parcel of land purely on its grape growing ability. Having been assessed by viticultural consultant Stephen Skelton MW at the time, Strutt & Parker offered four parcels of 35 acres, 22 acres,  52 acres and 7.5 acres, the first three lots for sale at £10,000 per acre, and the fourth for £20,000 per acre.
With more vineyards being planted however, Simpson highlighted the lack of winemaking facilities.
“The problem with England is that there’s a lot of vineyards but relatively few wineries,” she said, adding that at least three people had been in touch to ask if Simpson could do contract winemaking in 2018.
“The big issue this year [2018] is where the grapes are going to go. Even a 10 to 20% increase would be an issue, but this year it’s well over 100%,” she said.

Fake sommelier lapel pins replicating the official Japan Sommelier Association accreditation have been found sold online through auction sites in Japan despite being banned, the association has warned.
The Japan Sommelier Association has alerted restaurants to look out for unqualified individuals wearing fake lapel pins after it uncovered a man who had sold 38 fake pins for a total of ¥1.3 million (US$11,800) on an undisclosed auction site, reported Kyodo News Agency.
The association said over 100 fake lapel pins had been offered online over the past few years.
The lapel pin of a bunch of grapes is given to individuals by the association after they have passed qualification tests including written and tasting exams. The pins are prohibited being sold or borrowed, the association said.
“The qualification is not something you can buy and (the lapel pin) is not an item for a collection,” said Shinya Tasaki, the president of the association, who became the first Japanese winner of the World’s Best Sommelier Competition in 1995. “It’s disrespectful to those who were certified after their hard work,” he said.
Becoming a certified sommelier under the Japan Sommelier Association requires at least three years of work experience before taking a series of written and tasting exams.
The current number of sommeliers in Japan is said to be around 30,000, and 13,000 are women.

Wildfires continue to burn across the northern tip of the South Island in New Zealand, throughout the wine growing region of Nelson, and could do so for weeks, fire chiefs have warned.
Vineyards in Nelson
So far, no significant damage has been done to any vineyards in the region and there have been no casualties, however an estimated 3,000 people have been evacuated from the Wakefield and Pigeon Valley as fire fighters battle to keep the blaze under control.
The Tasman fire covers more than 2,300 hectares (5,700 acres) with a 25km (15 mile) perimeter, according to The Guardian. The fire began last Tuesday, with fire fighters working for the past seven days to contain the blaze, which is expected to rage well into March.
Authorities believe that the fire was caused by a spark from agricultural machinery, with much of the affected area south of Nelson used for forestry, but also home to many small farms.
Bushfires are relatively uncommon in New Zealand, but this is the second significant blaze in two years, the last being in 2017, and follows a heatwave that pushed temperatures in some parts of the country to 30C.

2000 hectare fire in the area appears to have been contained short of Upper Moutere. Brilliant effort from firefighters and helicopters our thanks to you all.

Thank you for your note Kim. So far the fires have skirted around us – feeling very lucky but still a little on edge. Thinking of those who have been evacuated and wait to hear how their properties are. Huge praise to all those courageously fighting this awful fire. 🙏🏻 ☔️ https://t.co/II7Myz2D6u

Japan’s leading wine importers and retail stores have slashed prices for imported wines as the free-trade agreement between Japan and the EU officially came into effect on 1 February.
Retailers in the country including supermarkets Aeon Co., FamilyMart Co, and wine importers such as Suntory and Asahi Beer’s importing business, have cut prices on wines in line with the elimination of a 15% tariff (or 125 yen per litre) imposed on European wines.
The Economic Partnership Agreement signed in July last year is projected to generate an economic benefit of around ¥5.2 trillion (US$48 billion) and create about 290,000 jobs for Japan, according to media reports.
Aeon Co. Japan’s biggest supermarket chain reduced prices on 330 wines by an average of 10%, and FmailyMart plans to cut prices on 14 of its imported European wines by up to 17%.
Earlier, Suntory Wine International, which manages wine business under Suntory Group, has announced that it will cut prices for 69 categories of imported wines from the EU with discounts ranging from 1% to 11%, starting with shipments on 1 February, according to Nikkei Asian Review.
Suntory Wine International owns its own Japanese winery Tomi no Oka and also three Bordeaux estates, namely Château Lagrange, Château Beychevelle and Château Beaumont.
Asahi Beer has also announced price cuts for 40 different imported wines in its portfolio. These imported EU wines will receive discounts from 4% to 17%, according to another report by Japanese media NHK News.
The EPA will abolish about 99% of the tariffs on Japanese products sold in the EU, while 94% of tariffs on European exports to Japan will be scrapped initially, before expanding to 99%, starting from 1 February.

The Consorzio Delle Venezie DOC – the protected designation for Pinot Grigio from northeastern Italy – has unveiled its first bottles from the 2018 harvest at the Wine Paris trade show, which opened today in the French capital.

Created in 2017, the DOC covers the Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige and Veneto regions, and permits the use of Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay, Friulano, Garganega, Müller-Thurgau, Pinot Bianco and Verduzzo.
The new DOC was established in order to “streamline and redefine” Pinot Grigio from northeastern Italy, offering wine trade professionals and consumers a guarantee of origin and quality.
Nearly half of the global production of Pinot Grigio comes from Italy, and 85% of it is concentrated in the Triveneto area.
Pinot Grigio Delle Venezie DOC wines are required to be at least 85% Pinot Grigio, while the remainder may be any white grape allowed to be grown in the region. All wines undergo taste tests by an independent panel and are subject to a maximum yield of 126hl/ha. Meanwhile, sparkling Pinot Grigio Delle Venezie DOC must be tank-fermented, and must contain less than 32g/L of residual sugar.
“We are kicking off a new year of powerful promotional activities for the Consorzio with a Pinot Grigio of outstanding quality that we believe will provide an encouraging boost to the growing curiosity and interest that buyers and the foreign press have shown in it”, said Albino Armani, president of the Consorzio.
“We are driven by two concepts dear to our hearts: the extremely high quality of the product and the guarantee offered by certification of the new Stile Italiano Pinot Grigio”.
More than 80 labels will be available for tasting at the Consorzio stand (Pav. C4127) at Wine Paris, including the first wines from the 2018 vintage.
“We had exceptional growth throughout 2018 on international markets, a sure sign that our concept of supply chain traceability was well-received and appreciated,” added Armani. “Our goal of repositioning the Pinot Grigio from Northeastern Italy with a strong regional identity has us looking confidently to the future”.

Quinta do Noval has unveiled a new look for its range of wines as the Port house releases its Douro reds from the ‘great’ 2016 vintage.
The new-look Noval range of reds
At a masterclass in London this morning, Christian Seely, who is head of AXA Millésimes, which owns Quinta do Noval, presented a range of repackaged wines from the estate, all of which hailed from 2016 harvest.
Describing it as a “great year in the Douro”, he said that it had yielded “some of the most thrilling vintage Ports ever produced”, along with “great wines” – and it was the latter that had been given a revised appearance.
As pictured above, the labels and names of the wines have been modified and standardised in order to present the great diversity of grape varieties more clearly. There are now six wines available, of which three are blended and three are single varietal wines, made using Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Petit Verdot.
Speaking further about the conditions in 2016, Seely said it was “a year of extremes” with “a mild and wet winter” and “a lot of water between January and the end of April”, ensuring the vines could benefit from a good reserve of soil moisture during what was then a “very hot and dry” August.
“We have almost desert conditions between the beginning of May and the end of September, so unless you have a good reserve of water in the soil, the situation can become alarming by July,” he said.
Indeed, in 2016, despite the relatively-high soil moisture content, such was the heat in August, the vines began “to shut down”, according to Seely.
Thankfully, three-days of rain in mid-September ensured the vines recovered, ensuring a smooth, sustained ripening until harvesting finished.
“If you look through the harvest reports at Noval you will see in most of the great years it is stated that at the end of August or early September, ‘fortunately there was much-needed rain’ because it gets the vines going again for the harvest period, which can go on for 6-8 weeks,” he recorded.
“That is vital, and it happened in 2016, when between 12-14 September we had three days of rain, followed by lovely sunny weather for the rest of September and throughout October, meaning that we could harvest in perfect conditions, and the rain meant that the wines started working again so we had great end of season maturity,” he continued.
As a result, he said, “2016 is great for red wines and Port”.
Finally, he announced, “And 2017 was lovely as well, it was absolutely great, and we will most certainly declare Quinta do Noval vintage Port and Nacional from the 2017 harvest as well.”
Indeed, after the masterclass was over, Seely described the 2015, 16 and 17 harvests as “three marvellous years in the Douro for reds and vintage Port.”

The Isle of Raasay Distillery in the Scottish Hebrides has made available a bespoke 30-litre cask of its single malt to purchase, offering a more accessible format to Scotch lovers compared to the distillery’s standard 190-litre barrels.
The Isle of Raasay distillery’s 190-litre barrel (left) compared with its newly available 30-litre (right).
The new 30 litre ex-Speyside Scotch whisky oak casks will be available alongside the 190-litre first-fill ex-American whiskey casks, which are hat are currently maturing in the island warehouse.
All Raasay spirit is produced and distilled on the island, using only Scottish barley, distillers’ yeast and mineral-rich water sourced and filtered directly from a Celtic well on site.
Isle of Raasay Single Malt will be lightly peated and fruity, utilising the best of the island’s natural elements and reflecting Raasay’s rugged natural beauty, and uses water from an ancient Celtic well located behind Borodale House at every stage of production, from mashing to fermentation, to cask and bottling strength reduction, to retain natural flavours in the final whisky.
Once the spirit is ready, both large and small casks are filled by the distillery team and left to age into the first ever Raasay Single Malt.
Distillery Co-founder Alasdair Day said: “We wanted to make our first single malt more accessible in these new smaller casks. Depending on the angels’ share, after three years we expect to get around 40 bottles from the 30 litre casks, each offering a distinctly different character of Raasay whisky to our other bottlings.”
Each 30 litre cask is priced at £999, and is available to purchase on Raasay Distillery’s website and in person at the distillery, and will be released and bottled after three years maturation. Buyers are then welcome to keep the cask as a memento.
The 190 litre casks meanwhile are priced at £5,000, with around 250 bottles expected from each following a 10 year maturation period in first-fill ex-American whiskey casks.
The Isle of Raasay Distillery opened in September 2017 and became the first “legal” distillery on the beautiful Hebridean island.

What or who inspired you to become a sommelier?
When I was 22, I started working as a wine salesman for Mielzynski, one of Poland’s biggest wine merchants. The experience was great and gave me the chance to work with people who had the same passion for wine and who could share their knowledge with me. I then wanted to bring my experience to a restaurant environment, which led me to move to London where I worked at Gordon Ramsay’s Maze.
What’s your favourite part of the job?
There are so many parts of my job that I love: meeting new people; working with passionate colleagues and exploring new food and wines. Every day brings something new which makes this job so interesting.
What’s the biggest misconception about the role of a sommelier?
There are probably many misconceptions, and I’m sure some people think we only travel and drink wine! In reality it’s slightly different.
What’s your go-to drink at the end of a long day?
A glass of Riesling, or a Chenin Blanc from the Loire Valley. I love the acidity and minerality of those two varieties of grape.
What’s your most embarrassing front-of-house moment?
At the beginning of my career as a sommelier, I accidentally used a bottle of Picpoul to top up the glasses of a table drinking some very expensive Burgundy. As you can imagine, it was not the best day of my life.
If you could give your younger self advice when starting out as a somm, what would it be?
Listen and learn from people who have more experience than you.
What bottle sparked your love of wine?
It was a bottle of Georg Breuer Schlossberg Riesling. I tasted it and realised that it is my favourite grape variety: complex, aromatic and very elegant.
What to date has been your most memorable wine experience?
I will never forget a trip to Madeira, where I tasted some of the best wines produced on the beautiful island.
Which customer habit annoys you the most?
I am not annoyed by guests’ habits. The only thing that I really don’t like is impoliteness.
Who is your inspiration in the gastronomic world?
My colleagues! I am very grateful to work with such passionate people who give me inspiration to develop and be better every day.
What’s your ultimate food and wine pairing?
Jamon Iberico and a glass of Sherry. It’s not very original, but I love it.
Where would your fantasy vineyard be?
It’s too difficult to choose just one. It would either be Rheingau or Madeira.
If you weren’t a sommelier, what would you be doing and why?
I have absolutely no idea. Maybe I would be professional coffee drinker, music listener and book reader!
Which wine (grape/style) do you find it impossible to get along with?
I am not a big fan of Gewürztraminer.
Who is the most memorable customer you’ve ever served and why?
David Cameron is the most memorable customer I have served. He was very humble and polite.
What makes you most proud to be a sommelier working in London?
London is one of the best cities when it comes to hospitality. It is a great place to develop as a sommelier, meet people from all over the world and taste some of the greatest wines.
What’s on your wine bucket list?
The list is very long, but I would like to visit Australia as I have never been there before.
Finally, what wine and paired plate would you pick from your list and why?
The langoustine tartare served with beetroot and crème fraîche brunoise and langoustine ice cream. I would pair this with Tenuta di Fessina Erse 2016 from Sicily. The wine has a very
delicate, mineral character which compliments the langoustine perfectly, but also has enough freshness and acidity to cut through the crème fraîche. It’s a lovely combination.

In the final extract from this year’s shortlisted drinks books in the André Simon Awards, Jamie Goode argues the notion that not all wine faults are necessarily complete negatives.
Perfection versus imperfection: On the nature of beauty
I want to introduce a concept that I think is really helpful for understanding wine faults, and for grasping the notion that some flavour chemicals can be both faulty and positive, depending on the concentration and the context. This is the Japanese concept of wabi-sabi. Put in simple terms, it is the idea that flaws can bring out beauty, or that flaws are in fact part of beauty. In contrast to the Western aesthetic of striving for a beauty that lies in the attainment (or near attainment) of perfection, wabi- sabi suggests that beauty is transient, incomplete, and imperfect. Features that are not beautiful in and of themselves can contribute to beauty, and the wabi-sabi aesthetic—in many ways a more satisfying and richer one—includes characteristics such as asymmetry, irregularity, simplicity, economy, modesty, and austerity. The idea of applying wabi-sabi to wine faults came from my discussions with Sam Harrop, who should get the credit.
Wine consultant Ken Ohashi introduced Sam and me to a Japanese term that translates as “silence like a drop of water.” Imagine you are sitting by a pool in a zen garden. It is as silent and tranquil as you can get. But it’s the sound of water drops that shows you how silent it is—without this subtle noise, you wouldn’t have recognised and appreciated the silence. Another example is the gentle ticking of a mechanical clock in an other- wise silent room: it seems to emphasise the quietness. Ohashi gives the example of a red wine that he tried, with some match- stick and pepper reductive characters. He describes these as the “minerality” of the wine, without which he thinks it would have tasted simple and even watery. But the presence of these traces of what could be called a wine fault—reduction—allowed him to see the purity of the wine. In the absence of the reduction, he wouldn’t have recognised the purity.
Perfumers are familiar with the idea that smells that are highly aversive on their own can be useful in creating a beautiful perfume. One of the most expensive ingredients in perfume is ambergris, which is taken from what is the whale equivalent of a cat’s fur ball (it is produced in the digestive system of sperm whales). This is actually quite disgusting, and smelled alone it would be repellent. But in a mix of odours, it provides interest and complements other, more immediately attractive smells while acting as a fixer, helping the aromas of the perfume persist. Another example is the aroma of jasmine. It contains small amounts of indole, which on its own would be an aversive smell. If people smell synthetic jasmine (which doesn’t have indole) and the real thing (which does), often they can’t tell them apart. But if they are pressed to decide which they prefer, they frequently opt for the real thing: the trace of the normally aversive indole adds something that people like to the smell of jasmine.
In a similar vein, let’s consider music. What makes it beautiful? Music follows mathematical order, but not perfectly—that would be very boring. In a study published in a leading scientific journal, Nature Neuroscience,1 the authors showed that music causes the release of the reward chemical dopamine in the brain, as do other pleasurable stimuli like food, drugs, and sex. They also showed that this dopamine release occurs both at peak emotional moments in the music—the “good bits,” such as a melodic hook or chorus—and in anticipation of those good bits. The authors state:
The anticipatory phase, set off by temporal cues signalling that a potentially pleasurable auditory sequence is coming, can trigger expectations of euphoric emotional states and create a sense of wanting and reward prediction. This reward is entirely abstract and may involve such factors as suspended expectations and a sense of resolution. Indeed, composers and performers frequently take advantage of such phenomena, and manipulate emotional arousal by violating expectations in certain ways or by delaying the predicted outcome (for example, by inserting unexpected notes or slowing tempo) before the resolution to heighten the motivation for completion.
Good composers and songwriters leave us unfulfilled. They tease us, showing us briefly the notes or chord that we want to hear and then avoiding it until the main hook or chorus. They build up expectation, and may even seek to diffuse the expectation by putting in unexpected notes or chords. In a sense, they create something more beautiful by avoiding the obvious expression of what we would classify as beauty. And the “flaws” or “deviations” highlight the beauty when it is finally revealed. Or perhaps they go deeper: the flaws and deviations may well be part of the beauty.
We find the same dynamic in the arena of flavour. Tasted alone, salt is not pleasant. It’s aversive. But at the appropriate level it adds life to food, creating a tension. The same goes for lemon juice: alone it is too acidic to be pleasurable for most people, but it creates a needed tension in some dishes. Sweetness alone is cloying; counter it with adequate acidity and it’s lovely.
Our attraction to faces is a further example of the complex nature of beauty. There are certain rules of facial attractiveness in humans, and the evidence suggests they are hardwired. For example, judgments of facial beauty are cross-culturally consistent among adults and children, and young babies will look longer at attractive faces than at less attractive ones. It’s not an absolute property; it’s just that there are guidelines governing what sort of faces people find desirable, and evolutionary explanations for why this might be so. Certainly, a beautiful face is something we find very compelling. Yet attempts by scientists to produce the “perfect” one result in a composite face that, while certainly striking and attractive, looks slightly bland and less attractive than you’d expect. It’s the presence of subtle flaws that brings out the real beauty. We love faces with a bit of character, not a total absence of even the smallest flaws. Most of all, though, we are attracted to the faces of those we know and like.
How does this relate to wine? I will argue that the most attractive, compelling wines are those that have elements of their character that, if they were in a different context or present at higher levels, might be considered faulty. It all depends on the wine, the context, and the consumer. When is volatile acidity too high? When is greenness good and when is it too bad? When are tannins too grippy and firm? When are earthy, spicy characters off-putting? When is savouriness or gaminess too prominent? When is new oak too obtrusive? When does a wine pass from mature to senescent? Many of these characters are present to a degree in some of the world’s greatest wines. These are the sorts of questions I will address in subsequent chapters.

A new top end Chilean Cabernet is soon to hit the market – and this time it’s not from the celebrated vineyards of the Maipo, but Colchagua.
Two Cabernets from Colchagua, but 20 years apart. The new top-end wine from LFE will take its cues from the first ever label from the producer, which hailed from the 1994 harvest
Hailing from a high-elevation area called Puquillay Alto in Colchagua, the new wine will cost £40; contain just Cabernet Sauvignon, and will be released in the summer to promote the fine wine potential in this part of Chile.
Made by Nicolas Bizzarri, who is head winemaker for Luis Felipe Edwards (LFE), the wine is the producer’s most expensive yet, and has been designed specifically to prove the quality attainable from the best sites in Colchagua, despite the fact that most top-end Chilean Cabs come from the free-draining terraces of the Maipo Alto.
Bizzarri explained, “The company started with a Cabernet from Colchagua, but that was from the valleys, but today the majority of our Cabernet comes from the Piquillay mountains, where we started planting vineyards in 2005.
“The Cabernet is totally different,” he continued, “And my target is to put Colchagua back on the map as a place for the best Cabernet in Chile.”
With a launch vintage for the new flagship wine being 2014, it celebrates a 20-year anniversary since the inaugural vintage release for Luis Felipe Edwards, which was a 1994 Cabernet from Colchagua.
While that wine used grapes grown on the region’s more fertile valley floor situated around 250m above sea level, and was made in concrete tanks without refrigeration, the new fine wine from 2014 will hail entirely from the Puquillay Alto, where the vines are planted at 900m, and it has been aged for 24 months in French oak barriques.
“Our idea is to come back 20 years later with a Cabernet from Colchagua that can stand up to the best Cabernet Sauvignons in the world, be they from Maipo Alto or the Napa Valley,” he said.
Although Bizzarri admitted that he was under a certain pressure to source Cabernet grapes from the Maipo Alto to make a top end red, he said that he wanted to create a flagship wine for LFE from Colchagua, because the region represented the producer’s birthplace.
He also told db that LFE was the only Chilean wine business to have vineyards in Puquillay Alto, where it owns 2000 hectares, with 135ha planted to vines today, and another 100ha available for vineyards in the future.
Although the producer has yet to decide on a name for the wine, Bizzarri told db that he was considering calling it El Dueño, meaning ‘the founder’.
7,000 bottles have been made of the launch vintage, with some potentially available for the UK.
Commercial director for LFE in Europe, Peter Greet, said he saw an opportunity for the £40 red in the UK, recording that the landscape for top end Chilean Cabernet “wasn’t crowded”, adding that, “Wine aficionados have not been offered anything new for a decade.”
However, Bizzari expressed his concern at the level of latent demand in the UK. “I would love to sell it in the UK because it is the country where people know the most about wine, but at same time it is a country where it is hardest for Chile to sell expensive wines.”
In contrast he said that Asia was an “obvious market”, along with Latin America, especially Brazil, “where they drink a lot of expensive wines”.
While the majority of Chile’s so called icon wines come from Maipo Alto, particularly the sub region of Puente Alto – the source of both Viñedo Chadwick and Almaviva – when Montes launched its very top expression of Cabernet called Taita in 2013, it used grapes from Colchagua, specifically its estate in Marchigüe.
Indeed, Aurelio Montes has previously told db that he believes this area in Colchagua is the “perfect spot” for Cabernet in Chile.

The Real Wine Fair is set to represent around a third more countries when it returns to London for its sixth year in May, as interest in natural, low-intervention, organic, and biodynamic wines grows.
More than 170 growers are set to attend the Real Wine Fair in Tobacco Dock, east London, in May (Photo: The Real Wine Fair)
Around 170 artisan and small producers from 23 different countries will represent the sector in London this year – an increase of around a third on 2017’s  show, when 160 producers from 15 countries took part. The 2019 show will include a number of UK producers for the first time, along with producers from Greece, Poland, Slovakia and Serbia.
Organiser Doug Wregg of natural and artisan wine importer Les Caves de Pyrene said there will be around 50 new producers at the 2019 show, including producers from Georgia, Croatia, USA and Australia. Meanwhile France and Italy would remain a strong focus for the show, with growers from 14 different regions of Italy, from Sicily to Piedmont, while Central Europe was also very well represented.
Running alongside the show is Real Wine Month, a month-long celebration throughout May, in which more than 300 bars, bistros, restaurants, and independent retailers and wholesalers across the UK and Ireland will embrace low-intervention, organic, biodynamic and natural wines and promote them to their customers, serving them by the glass or offering discounts on bottles. During the 2017 campaign, there were around 50 additional events, ranging from tastings, wine dinners, masterclasses and grower takeovers alongside the campaign.
Wregg said that although hard data on the increasing popularity of real wine and stats of producer numbers was hard to gather, there was plenty of anecdotal evidence to demonstrate the proliferation of natural wine bars since 2010.
“Virtually, every enquiry we receive is from new customers who are setting up on- or off-trade businesses specialising in organic, biodynamic, low intervention or natural wines,” he told db.
“You see the wines on restaurant lists throughout the land, but the proliferation of natural wine bars since 2010 illustrates the dynamic. Plus there is a new generation of sommeliers and retail buyers.”
Wregg added that contrary to the perception that natural wines did not age well, lees-aged and oxidative whites, or wines with higher acidity, amber/skin contact, and traditionally-made low sulphur reds had the wherewithal to “age beautifully”.
“A lot of these wines are held for years before release,” he said, although he recognised the “subset” of juicy, carbonic drink-me reds that were good to drink sooner than later,
“One thing that the last 10-15 years of drinking has proved is that the wines are a lot less fragile than people might think. And if I look at the line-up at the Real Wine Fair, I would say that some are pushing the boundaries, while others are the reference in their respective regions.”
The Real Wine Fair will take place at Tobacco Dock in Wapping, east London on 12 -13 May, with the Real Wine Fair Ireland, organised by Le Caveau in Kilkenny, taking place in Dublin on 15 May for the second year.

Irish whiskey has gained protected status in Australia, giving the spirit legal protection for the first time in the country’s history to safeguard against fakes.

Irish whiskey will now have its own definition and protection under Australian law, following ongoing lobbying efforts from the Irish Whiskey Association (IWA).
It means that decisive action can be taken against fake Irish whiskey products and will ensure consumer confidence in the quality and authenticity of Irish whiskey.
Australia is a top ten export market for Irish whiskey and one of the fastest-growing, according to the IWA.
In 2017, 1.9 million bottles of Irish whiskey were sold in Australia and according to the CSO the volume of Irish whiskey exports to Australia increased by 35% in the first 10 months of 2018.
Sales of Irish whiskey soared in its home country in 2018, making it one of the fastest-growing spirits categories behind gin.
Carleen Madigan, the IWA’s legal advisor, said the move shows a “a major achievement in our efforts to protect the integrity of Irish whiskey in Australia as a significant export market.”
“This registration means Irish whiskey for the first time is protected and defined in Australian law, which will greatly enhance our ability take action against rogue traders. This will ensure Irish whiskey maximises its potential and maintains its growth trajectory.”
It comes almost five years after Australian lawmakers granted trademarks for Scotch whisky to protect consumers and retailers against counterfeiting.

Brewing giant Carlsberg’s profits were held steady thanks to rapid growth in its non-alcoholic and “craft” beer brands, and premiumisation in Asia.
 

Like many brewers Carlsberg, which owns brands such as Turborg and Kronenberg, sold more beer in the summer moths in Europe thanks to a combination of the World Cup and an extended heatwave. Net revenue rose to by 6.4% DKK 62.5 billion (£7.4 million), while operating profits grew organically up to DKK 9.3 billion, up 11% from 2017.
While premium beer brand volumes rose in Britain over the course of 2018, overall volumed dipped 3%. Carlsberg’s total beer volumes have fallen by just over 8 million hl since 2014.
Alcohol-free beer performed well in western Europe, with volume growth of 33%. The Danish beer giant launched its first-global non-alcoholic drink, Birrel, last year. The brand was launched in Poland and Bulgaria in May.
The brewer said public feedback has been “positive” for the new brew, already taking up 15% of the alcohol-free beer segment.
The low ABV category offers “excellent” profit margins, according to the firm’s latest financial statement.
‘We believe it will remain an attractive beverage category in the years to come, as it benefits from the growing health and wellness trend amongst consumers.
Carlsberg also worked to expand its footprint in China over the past year. “By the end of the year, we were present in more than 20 large cities,” it said, “where the response to our international portfolio has been very positive.”
The news comes as a number of global breweries such as Heineken have extended and refreshed their low-alcohol ranges to cater for growing demand.
More than half of Brits who took part in a OnePoll survey last year said they have at least tried a non-alcoholic beverage, while 52% also said that non-alcoholic beers have become more socially acceptable in the past two years.
Sales of non-alcoholic and low alcohol beer rose by 38% in 2018 compared to the previous year, according to Kantar. Sales rose £2.1 million compared to the same 12 week period last year.

American wine critic Matt Kramer kicked off the Sauvignon 2019 Celebration in Marlborough last week with a characteristically controversial speech in which he claimed there is no culture of Sauvignon Blanc anywhere in the world.
American wine critic Matt Kramer believes there is no culture of Sauvignon Blanc anywhere in the world
The first keynote speaker to take to the podium during the three-day event, Kramer stated that the biggest challenge facing Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc was the fact that there was no culture around the grape in any of the world’s leading wine regions.
“New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is the most preposterous, unpredictable success story in the history of wine. You took the world by storm with lightening in a bottle. No one has achieved the same thing in the last 40 years, not even Napa. There’s a sense of impatience, but in wine time you only started last week.
Marlborough boasts 23,000 hectares of Sauvignon Blanc
“The future of New Zealand Sauvignon lies in getting a premium, as a commodity wine is a race to the bottom, which you don’t want and can’t afford to do. There is no culture of Sauvignon Blanc anywhere in the world, which is your biggest challenge in terms of being able to command a premium for your wines.
“There’s a culture of Pinot Noir, Riesling, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese, but no culture of Sauvignon Blanc. You have the scale and capital, a distinction of place, 23,000 hectares of vines, and an ability to market the product, but you don’t have the advantage of a culture of Sauvignon Blanc, and without it you can’t command a premium as you can’t go beyond your culture,” Kramer said.
While many may argue that the Loire Valley has successfully built a Sauvignon Blanc culture, particularly in Sancerre, Kramer was quick to dismiss the idea.
“There is no culture of Sauvignon in Sancerre, nor in Bordeaux or Friuli. They didn’t grow Sauvignon Blanc in Sancerre until after phylloxera – before that it was Pinot Noir, Gamay and Chasselas in the ground.
“Pinot became too expensive, so producers in Sancerre turned to Sauvignon Blanc and made it as a commodity wine. They never created a culture there.
“They have a Burgundian vision in Sancerre of small vineyards but there are no stories of monks and kings,” Kramer said. “Now, for the first time, Marlborough is creating a culture of Sauvignon Blanc. When this culture emerges, producers will then be able to command a premium for their wines,” he added.
At the inaugural Sauvignon Blanc Celebration in 2016, Kramer said that Marlborough Sauvignon producers were suffering from a “midlife crisis”.

Chief winemaker at Champagne Nicolas Feuillatte, Guillaume Roffiaen, believes that releasing his vintage blanc de blancs Champagnes with less maturation gives customers “more choice” with regards to food pairing options.
At a tasting of the Champagne co-operative’s UK on-trade range, which officially launched back in September 2018, Roffiaen said that he now releases his blanc de blancs expressions when they were “younger and fresher”.
Referring to the Nicolas Feuillatte Collection Vintage 2012 Blanc de Blancs and Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs 2012, he said: “We used to sell our blanc de blancs with more maturation, now they’re younger and fresher.
“When you release them when they’re older, you reduce the pairing opportunities. Releasing them when they’re younger gives the customer the choice of whether to drink them now or age them for longer.”
He noted how it was important for the on-trade range to be particularly suited to being paired with food and have the ability to work as an apéritif right the way through to dessert.
He noted how the Collection Vintage blanc de blancs was “good on its own too” while the Grand Cru, with its grapes sourced predominantly further south in the Côte des Blancs, was more adaptable, working especially well with seafood.
Speaking more generally, he praised the producer’s diversity, boasting around 2,100 hectares of vineyards (6-7% of the total Champagne production zone), which he said was “key”.
This he said, allowed him to have great flexibility in the use of reserve wines, which form 40% of the NV réserve brut. This 40% is formed of wines from as many as five or six different years, with the proportions of grapes used kept exactly the same as the blend used in the wine overall.
Roffiaen joined Nicolas Feuillatte from Champagne Drappier in 2014. He revealed that he still works with the previous winemaker, Jean-Pierre Vincent, who visits the producer two to three times a year to ensure that consistency is maintained.
In 1986, former New York coffee merchant Nicolas Feuillatte told his wine brand to form a co-operative. It now boasts 4,500 growers producing between 10 and 11 million bottles a year and counts France, the US and the UK as its top three markets.
In September 2018, Nicolas Feuillatte signed a new distribution deal in the UK, appointing Castelnau Wine Agencies to represent it and develop its on-trade presence. This was the first time that two major Champagne co-operatives had decided to work together in this way.
Castelnau Wine Agencies was formed when Patriarche Wine Agencies was acquired by Cooperative Régionale des Vins de Champagne – the makers of Castelnau – in 2013.

Ethical beer brand Toast Ale, which is brewed using surplus fresh bread destined for waste, has gained a listing with The Coop across the capital.
The brand’s Purebread Pale Ale (5% ABV) will be available in 57 Co-op stores in London, which the company said marked a ‘huge’ step in its growth and enabled customers to make more sustainable choices in the craft beer category.
David Ryan, chief ‘breadwinner’ at Toast Ale, said it was delighted with the new listing. “We’re delighted to be stocked in Co-op, bringing a sustainable offering to their craft beer range. We have a very strong customer base in the capital and are excited to offer drinkers more places to find us.”
He added that buyers were increasingly looking to compliment their existing craft beer ranges with sustainable options for ethically minded consumers.
“Toast’s efforts to connect communities, through sustainably brewed craft beer that raises awareness of food waste, will resonate with Co-op customers,” the company added.
The brand, which is already stocked by Tesco Express and Waitrose, was launched in January 2016 by Tristram Stuart, founder of food waste charity Feedback, in collaboration with Hackney Brewery. All profits go towards tackling the issue of food waste and the company has given nearly £15,000 of profits to charity.
The beer was developed using surplus bread, which is made into breadcrumbs and toasted before being brewed with malted barley, hops and yeast. Toast Ale said that around one third of the grain bill came from recovered resources and it has used almost 1 million slices of surplus bread since it was founded.
The Co-op already works with FareShare, the UK’s largest charity fighting hunger and food waste, redistributing around 1,300 tonnes of surplus food – equivalent to 3,085,000 meals – from its depots. It also has its own redistribution programme, Food Share, which is designed to tackle store-level surplus by redistributing to local community groups.
Last year Suffolk brewer Adnams brewed three beers for UK retailer Marks & Spencer using surplus bread leftover from the store’s sandwich production, while cereal giant Kellogg’s and Salford-based brewery Seven Bro7hers teamed up to create a beer made from cornflakes that were either too big, too small or too overcooked to make it through quality control.

Sauvignon Blanc producers in Marlborough should ditch the idea of highlighting individual terroirs and instead take a “Champagne approach to blending”, according to American wine critic Matt Kramer.
UK chat show host Graham Norton takes part in a blending session for his popular New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc brand
Speaking at the second International Sauvignon Blanc Celebration in Marlborough last week, Kramer took the controversial standpoint that a terroir driven approach may not be the best way forward to the New Zealand region.
“The Burgundians have been blending Pinot Noir for 500 years but we’ve all accepted the culture as the truth that it’s best to show off site specifics. We live in a world where the Burgundian vision of greatness and quality is the Holy Grail, but we need to understand what makes Sauvignon Blanc unique, desirable and essential.
Matt Kramer believes the future for Marlborough Sauvignon lies in blending from different sites
“You always hear about the importance of terroir, not about blending. We’ve been saturated with the Burgundian vision of terroir, but is it the right one for New Zealand, or should you be taking a Champagne approach of blending?” Kramer questioned during his speech.
He went on to state that “the best Champagnes in the world” are made from a blend of grapes from different vineyards.
“Some vineyards are complete in themselves, and there are some great single vineyard Champagnes and grower Champagnes, but they’re idiosyncratic. The most complete Champagnes are often made from blends, which is something to consider.
“If you identify what each of your vineyards give you the answer may lie in the blend rather than the Burgundian model, which is the church I worship in. We’re all immersed in this Burgundian vision of beauty, but it may not be the answer for elevating Sauvignon Blanc to its highest and best expressions.
“No wine can command a premium without validation. You need to find a rap star who loves Sauvignon Blanc – get Beyoncé over to Marlborough. The validators have changed. Critics are on their way out – I’m just a old dinosaur,” he said.
At the inaugural Sauvignon Blanc celebration in 2016, Kramer said that Marlborough Sauvignon producers were suffering from a “midlife crisis”.

What or who inspired you to become a sommelier?
I was on a trip to Montepulciano in 2008 and had just finished studying tourism. It was then that I decided to continue studying, with a focus on wine instead.
What’s your favourite part of the job?
Without a doubt, the service element. I love interacting with all the guests, talking about the wines I am passionate about, that I think they will love too.
What’s the biggest misconception about the role of a sommelier?
That you drink a lot. Sure, I TASTE a lot of wine, but probably drink a lot less than the average person. I like to keep a clear head so I can study more about wine in the early mornings.
What’s your go-to drink at the end of a long day?
Lager. From the bottle, ice cold. Not after every shift though, maybe twice a week.
What’s your most embarrassing front-of-house moment?
Dropping a full tray of drinks in the middle of a table of eight in my early days as a sommelier.
If you could give your younger self advice when starting out as a sommelier, what would it be?
Start studying wine earlier! And pay more attention to languages – you will need them.
What bottle sparked your love of wine?
Avignonesi Grandi Annate 1997.
What to date has been your most memorable wine experience?
When a guest came to Berners Tavern and brought his own wine, and insisted on me tasting all of them too. It was such a memorable occasion that I even remember all the wines. Cristal 1990; Montrachet 2010 Romanee Conti; Coche Dury Corton Charlemagne 2005-2007.
La Tache 2002 Armand Rousseau Chambertin1996
Which customer habit annoys you the most?
When they drink white Burgundy too chilled. It should be 10- 12 degrees.
Who is your inspiration in the gastronomic world?
Giorgio Locatelli and Jason Atherton.
What’s your ultimate food and wine pairing?
Nebbiolo with anything white truffle related.
Where would your fantasy vineyard be?
Langhe.
If you weren’t a sommelier, what would you be doing and why?
A chef – even though I never cook!
Which wine (grape/style) do you find it impossible to get along with?
Sauvignon Blanc.
Who is the most memorable customer you’ve ever served and why?
Rod Stewart – the funniest guest I’ve ever served.
What makes you most proud to be a sommelier working in London?
I think London is the wine capital of Europe – it feels like playing in the premier league.
What’s on your wine bucket list?
Henry Jayer Cros Parentoux.
Finally, what wine and paired plate would you pick from your list and why?
Slowcooked shoulder of Herdwick lamb, sugar snaps, peas and broad beans, roasted wild mushrooms and mint sauce, paired with Mount Edelstone Henschke 1994. The body and tannins of the wine compliment the texture of the dish, the flavour profiles of the wine work well with the flavours.

London junk food joint MeatLiquor has teamed up with Queens Skate Dine Bowl to launch an adult-only bar and bowling experience inspired by the ’90s film The Big Lebowski.
Called The Liquor Lanes, the new private venue will open on 21 February, complete with five ruby-red bowling lines, geometric wall designs and MeatLiquor’s trademark burgers and cocktails.
Inspired by the trip scene in the film, Liquor Lanes will be located within Queens’ existing site in Queensway. The area also has a private bar and sound system.
Dishes include deep-fried mac n cheese with marinara sauce; sticky chicken wings with a honey and French mustard sauce and MeatLiquor’s signature hot mess consisting of hash browns with blue cheese sauce, jalapenos, buffalo sauce and pickles.
Meatliquor has been serving its food in Queens since 2017, offering its full menu complete cocktails and vegetarian and vegan options.
In November last year, it was announced that MeatLiquor’s original London restaurant in Marylebone would close at the end of this month. 
The restaurant group has since announced that it is to relocate just a few hundred metres down the road on Margaret Street.
The new site will have a capacity of 300 with live music and DJs.
The current restaurant, on the ground floor of a carpark, opened in 2011, originally on a two-year lease. It will officially close this Saturday (9 February).

Super Tuscan Ornellaia has commissioned Iranian-American artist Shirin Neshat to “interpret” its 2016 vintage as part of the ‘Vendemmia d’Artista’ series.
The theme of this year’s vintage (the 11th in the art series) was ‘la tensione’ (tension), with Neshat drawing on the works of the famous 11th century poet Omar Khayyam.
She said: “Throughout centuries, in classical Persian literature, our great mystics and poets have continuously made references to wine, as a form of spiritual intoxication to the human soul, elevating the mind from the banality of everyday life to reach the depth of humanity and existence.
“Over the years, in my own artistic practice, I have consistently made use of ancient mystical Persian literature, either in the form of poetry inscribed as calligraphy over my photographic surfaces, or as songs in my videos and film-based work. In the work created for Ornellaia I inscribed a poem by the legendary poet, Omar Khayyām, titled: ‘Without pure wine I cannot exist’. He has written more than any other Persian poet about the relationship between wine and spirituality.”
Neshat created an art installation at the winery and customised a series of 111 large format bottles (100 double magnums, 10 imperials and one Salmanazar) as well as a special label that will be included on one 75cl bottle in each case of the 2016 vintage.
As Ornellaia said in a statement: “The labels represent details of female faces, hands and bodies completely covered by Farsi calligraphy. These contrasts between the softness of the skin and the graphic nature of the text seduce the eye and engage the imagination.”
The large format bottles will be sold by Sotheby’s at a later date in support of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation’s ‘Mind’s Eye’ project which supports those with impaired or no vision.
Ornellaia has just agreed a three year partnership to support the project through its Vendemmia d’Artista series.
Giovanni Geddes da Filicaja, CEO Ornellaia, said: “Today, as the Vendemmia d’Artista marks its 11th year, it continues to attract funds helping the Art. In just its first ten editions, we have succeeded in donating more than two million dollars across the globe, just a small drop perhaps, but there is much more to come, and we are very proud to help the Mind’s Eye project of Guggenheim for the next years.
“It is a great pleasure for Ornellaia to be able to establish a long-term relationship between our Vendemmia d’Artista project and an art institution of such international stature as the Guggenheim Museum. Appreciation of great wine, like that of great art, requires the involvement of all the senses, and that is precisely why we decided to lend our support to a project of such stature as “Mind’s Eye,” designed to assist sight-challenged adults to experience art through creation of a model that utilises all the senses to provide an entryway for enjoying art throughout the world. This initiative will be, without any doubt, an invaluable heritage for future generations.”
Richard Armstrong, director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Foundation, added: “We are deeply grateful that beginning this year, proceeds from the sale of Ornellaia Vendemmia D’Artista will be donated to the Guggenheim Museum in support of the Mind’s Eye program.  The founding mission of the Guggenheim was to collect and exhibit art that was not just modern, not just new, but revolutionary.  Thanks to Ornellaia, we can extend that mission to an even broader audience”.

The old adage of “beer before wine and you’ll feel fine” is a myth, according to Cambridge researchers, who have ruled that it doesn’t matter what order you drink in, you’ll still get a hangover if you drink too much.
Drinking beer before wine won’t reduce your chances of a hangover
“Beer before wine and you’ll feel fine; wine before beer and you’ll feel queer” is the common saying that many swear by. However researchers at Witten/Herdecke University in Germany and the University of Cambridge in the UK have now quashed that theory.
Publishing their findings in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the study saw the team recruit 90 volunteers, aged between 19 and 40 years old, and split them into three groups.
The first group consumed around two and a half pints of beer followed by four large glasses of wine. The second group consumed the same amounts of alcohol, but in reverse order. Subjects in the third, control group consumed either only beer or only wine.
A week later, participants in study groups one and two were switched to the opposite drinking order.
Control group subjects who drank only beer the first time around received only wine on the second study day (and vice versa). This way, the groups were not only compared to each other, but each participant was their own control, too.
Participants were asked about their wellbeing at regular intervals and were asked to judge their perceived level of drunkenness on a scale between 0 and 10 at the end of each study day. Before going to bed at the study site, all participants received an individualised amount of refrigerated drinking-water tailored to their body weight. All volunteers were kept under medical supervision overnight.
The following day, participants were asked about their hangover and given a score from 0-56 (the so-called Acute Hangover Scale) based on factors including thirst, fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, stomach ache, increased heart rate and loss of appetite.
The researchers found that none of the three groups had a significantly different hangover score with different orders of alcoholic drinks, although the women tended to have slightly worse hangovers than men.
“Using white wine and lager beer, we didn’t find any truth in the idea that drinking beer before wine gives you a milder hangover than the other way around,” says first author Jöran Köchling from Witten/Herdecke University. “The truth is that drinking too much of any alcoholic drink is likely to result in a hangover. The only reliable way of predicting how miserable you’ll feel the next day is by how drunk you feel and whether you are sick. We should all pay attention to these red flags when drinking.”
Dr Kai Hensel, a senior clinical fellow at the University of Cambridge and senior author of the study, added: “Unpleasant as hangovers are, we should remember that they do have one important benefit, at least: they are a protective warning sign that will certainly have aided humans over the ages to change their future behaviour. In other words, they can help us learn from our mistakes.”
The study is published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

Construction workers in the city of Viborg in Denmark have uncovered seven bottles of 113-year-old beer under floorboards in a building which once housed the Odin Brewery.

Founded in 1832, Odin Brewery was later closed in 1988, and at the time was Denmark’s oldest brewery, according to The Copenhagen Post. 
Construction workers renovating the building were shocked to discover seven, unopened bottles of beer dating to 1906, stowed inside a wooden box beneath the floorboards.
Speaking to DR Nyheder, Ersted Møller, a curator at the Viborg Museum, said: “The bottles are in exquisite condition with corks and labels intact. It looks like an entire palette of beer from back then. We have bottles from the Odin Brewery at the museum, but none with any content. I’ve spoken with beer experts who estimate that Odin beer from 1906 is very rare.”
“It could be fun to know what a Viborg beer tasted like back in 1906. Odin is a large part of Viborg’s history, and finding these beers is a fascinating prospect that shouldn’t be ignored.”
The news site later revealed that unfortunately, two of the corks had perished and the beer had evaporated, but the five remaining bottles remained full and in good condition.
Accompanying the beers was a note, handwritten by the then head brewer, CE Pehrsson. Dated 20 March 1906, it read: “The old floor was removed by master carpenter Niels Nielsen and a new floor was added. As we don’t know how long this floor will last, these words and some bottles of beer we brew these days will be put under the floor.
In 2008, fellow Danish brewer Carlsberg made a similar discovery, uncovering bottles of its own beer dating back to 1883. In 2016, it was able to recreate the beer after extracting living yeast cells from one of the old bottles. 
Other brewers have been able to complete similar feats. In 2016, Herzl Brewery in Israel used a rare type of grain to make a beer that would have been drunk at the time of Jesus, while an archaeological find in Peru inspired a US brewery to create a limited-edition pre-Incan beer.
Back in 2014, Belgian scientists and a Finnish brewery re-created a mid-19th century beer from samples salvaged from a shipwreck in the Baltic.
In recent archaeological beer finds, last month road workers completing a £1.5 billion upgrade in Cambridgeshire stumbled across what archaeologists believe to be the earliest evidence of beer ever uncovered in Britain, identifying fermented residue dating back to 400BC.

New Zealand’s Overseas Investment Office (OIO) has approved the sale of Central Otago wine estate Mt. Difficulty to US-based Foley Family Wines for NZ$52 million (£27m).
Mt. Difficulty has been sold to the US-based Foley Family Wines for NZ$52 million.
A statement from the OIO last week said the purchase included about 70ha of freehold land and about 110ha of leasehold land at the Bannockburn vineyard.
Mt. Difficulty is a medium-sized vineyard known for its Mt. Difficulty and Roaring Meg labels, and particularly its Pinot Noir and Riesling, produced by winemaker Matt Dicey.
Foley Family Wines is majority owned by United States-based Bill Foley, who also owns other New Zealand vineyards including Martinborough Vineyard, Te Kairanga Vineyard and Grove Mill Winery.
“Foley Family Wines plans to leverage its networks to increase exports of Mt Difficulty wines by cross-marketing with its existing labels,” the OIO statement added.
“It will continue Mt Difficulty’s plans to expand the Mt Difficulty vineyard restaurant and cellar door, develop a restaurant and a barrel facility at Te Kairanga Vineyard in Martinborough, and upgrade its Grove Mill Winery to increase production capacity.
“The investment will result in nine new jobs, mostly in the Wairarapa and Marlborough.”
As reported by Otago Daily Times, the original $55 million sale price for Mt. Difficulty was reduced to $52 million in exchange for Foley investing up to $3 million to expand Mt. Difficulty’s cellar door operation and restaurant.
The sale of Mt. Difficulty is the latest in a line of high-profile purchases of New Zealand vineyards by overseas investors, but at $52m its value dwarfs prior purchases.
In 2017, Pyramid Valley in North Canterbury was bought by Aotearoa New Zealand Fine Wine Estates (ANZFWE), co-founded by Steve Smith MW and Brian Sheth – an investor and wildlife conservationist from Austin, Texas – for $8m. ANZFWE has also purchased Lowburn Ferry Wines in Central Otago for $2.1m, with both sales approved by New Zealand Government’s Overseas Investment Office.
Last week it was confirmed that Urlar Farms in Wairarapa had been purchased by the Japanese sake brewer Nishi for NZ$8.75 million.

The “elephant in the room” of the New Zealand wine industry is the fact that its star grape, Sauvignon Blanc, “suffers from an image problem”, according to wine writer and consultant Emma Jenkins MW.
Kiwi Sauvignon’s image problem is the elephant in the room according to Emma Jenkins MW
Speaking at the second international Sauvignon Blanc Celebration in Marlborough last week, Jenkins told attendees: “Marlborough Sauvignon is coming of age. We’re four decades into this wild experiment and both our vines and our winemakers have matured.
“There is more experience and understanding of our land and as a result, our wines have more nuance. The elephant in the room however, is the fact that Sauvignon suffers from an image problem, as it’s viewed as being too simple.”
New Zealand born and based, Jenkins urged the crowd to “reconsider” their opinion of Sauvignon. “Didier Dagueneau’s Loire Sauvignons are remarkable, complex, profound vehicles for the expression of terroir and I believe Marlborough Sauvignon is absolutely able to achieve that too.
Emma Jenkins MW wants people to reconsider their view of NZ Sauvignon
“It’s the engine room of the New Zealand wine industry that we need to turn into a cultural treasure rather than a cash cow by making it more valuable,” she said.
Patrick Materman, chief winemaker at Brancott Estate, echoed Jenkins’ sentiments. “Sauvignon Blanc can be seen as predictable and samey, but nothing could be further from the truth, as there is so much depth and diversity from our offering.
“We’re getting over our midlife crisis and it’s time to take Sauvignon Blanc to the next level, but first we need to overcome headwinds like Brexit.
“Exports of New Zealand wine reached NZ$1.75 billion last year. The industry has grown at an exceptional rate and change will continue to be fast paced as we adapt to climate change and engage with new markets. It’s an exciting new phase but not without its challenges,” he said.
Touching on American wine critic Matt Kramer’s assertion that “there is no culture of Sauvignon Blanc anywhere in the world”, Materman said developing a Sauvignon culture was the “biggest challenge” produces “need to deliver on”.
As to whether a Burgundian style terroir focus or a Champagne blending model was the best way forward for the country, Materman believes “there is scope for both”.
“New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc shows a great sense of place. The country runs a large length of latitude, which helps contribute to the diversity of styles. We need to invest more in research in order to work out which Sauvignon Blanc is desired by which consumers,” he said.

Called ‘228 Litres’, the bar in Paris’s 9e arrondissement was founded by Pierre Renauld with help from iDealwine.
The bar will feature a digital wine list (perused on tablets or on visitor’s mobile phones) which will have some 350 references at all price points from under €20 a bottle to over €400, drawing extensively on the 500 domaines from across France that iDealwine deals with directly. Many of the wines will also be available by the glass.
As a “connected bar” not only will the digital wine list be updated regularly but each reference will come with access to iDealwine’s complete history of the estate, vintage descriptions, tasting notes, auction record and more.
In addition, patrons can pre-order wines they want to have when they arrive or ‘click and collect’. Wines can also be bought online and delivered to them.
The aim of the bar is to offer wines at “reasonable” prices with the cost of drinking in being 12% higher than taking a bottle home, so a bottle costing €9 to take away is €19 to drink in and so on. Corkage is set at €10 a bottle.
Furthermore, the partnership with iDealwine will allow the bar to offer older vintages and verticals from various estates.
Although much of the backing comes from the auctioneer, the driving force behind 228 Litres is Pierre Renauld.
Just 26, Renauld is an alumni of one of the country’s top business schools, EM Lyon, where he was part of the wine tasting team which won every French and international inter-university blind tasting competition in 2016.
He then spent a year at iDealwine (which had spotted his talents during the Sciences Po International Tasting) before joining the sommelier team at Vantre restaurant under the direction of famed sommelier Marco Pelletier. The restaurant is famous for a wine list that has some 2,000 references.
Renauld’s aim with 228 Litres was to create a bar and shop that was welcoming to both newcomers and the wine literate and a snob-free zone.
Wines can be bought to take away and those drinking in can buy by the bottle or the glass while small plates of cheese and charcuterie will also be available.
The emphasis is on ‘discovery’ with a small team on hand to guide patrons through the list while Renauld also wants the bar to host masterclasses and on regions from around the world.
For its part, iDealwine said in a statement that it had seen an “excellent opportunity” to engage with its clients in the physical world and help promote the producers with which it works.
“It’s with immense enthusiasm that all of the team at iDealwine has invested in accompanying Pierre on this new adventure.”

The Somerset market town of Frome is to get its first dedicated wine bar and shop this month with the opening of Stony Street House.
Catherine Hill in Frome
Located on the corner of Palmer Street and Catherine Hill in the centre of town, Stony Street House will offer 350 wines to drink in or takeaway as well as coffee, small plates and pizza.
There will be a strong focus on French, Spanish and Italian wines but also plenty of New World wines and English wines too. Sarah Helliwell MS, is head of wine, has also ensured many are from sustainable, organic and biodynamic producers.
As well as the bottled wines, there will be 10 wines on tap supplied by Uncharted Wines which will be offered by the glass and carafe and customers will also be able to bring in their own containers for refills too.
Stony Street House aims to have strong green credentials with no single use plastic on site and zero-food waste as well as discounts for customers who bring in their own coffee cups.
It will also work closely with local suppliers for its food and wine including: La Chasse, Yapp Brothers (hence the strong Mediterranean selection), Dusty Ape and Rupert’s Eggs.
The whole concept is the brainchild of Kent Barker, an industry veteran who has previously worked at Bibendum, Enotria and Jascots among other enterprises and who was also behind the nearby Beckford Bottle Shop.
He said: “Currently there is no sole wine shop or wine bar in Frome. Therefore, a large proportion of the population is not catered to. We want to bring knowledge and breadth of wine with an independent business that is in keeping with the town and in keeping with what locals and visitors love about Frome.
“I have been in the business for many years, from having my own place in the mid 80s in Cambridge via a long career in the wine industry to finding the best concept in the right building in the perfect location. This feels a personal project and one that is utterly exciting.”

Official figures from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) have revealed a strong year for Scotch Whisky exports in 2018, with the US also becoming its first overseas market to hit the billion-pound mark.
In 2018, the export value of Scotch Whisky grew by 7.8% in value to a record £4.7bn
In 2018, the export value of Scotch Whisky grew 7.8% by value to a record £4.70bn, with the previous record high £4.37bn in 2017.
The number of 70cl bottles exported also reaching record levels growing to the equivalent of 1.28bn, up +3.6%, with the previous record for export volume set in 2011 at 1.264bn 70cl bottles.
Karen Betts, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said: “These figures underscore strength of the Scotch Whisky category, which has continued to grow despite the challenges posed by Brexit and by tensions in the global trading system.”
This growth was driven largely by the US market, which crossed the billion-pound mark by value for the first time in 2018, rising in value from £921.7m in 2017 to a record £1.04 billion (an increase of 12.8%) in 2018. It remains the biggest export market by value for Scotch.
The The EU remains the largest region for exports, accounting for 30% of global value and 36% of global volume.
“A key driver for global growth is the growing market for premium spirits,” added Betts. “Scotch Whisky is in a great position to take advantage of this given its unrivalled reputation for quality, authenticity and provenance.”
Blended Scotch declined by 4.7% to £3.04bn, but there was further growth in exports of single malt Scotch, which grew by 11.3% in 2018 to £1.30bn.
The biggest gains by value were seen in India, which increased by 34% to £138.8m, followed by Mexico, which increased the value of its Scotch imports by 18.5% to £131.5m. Losses by value were recorded in Germany (down 5.3% to £173.9m, and Spain (down 2.6% to £170.4m).
By volume, France remains the biggest export market for Scotch, importing 187.8m bottles in 2018 (a rise of 5.3%), followed by the US with 136.8m (+7.4%). Both Germany and South Africa saw a decline in volumes of 18.3% and 19.5% respectively.
Despite overall growth across the board, Betts offered a word of caution, acknowledging the difficulties that could lie ahead as the UK’s deadline for leaving the EU approaches.
“We operate in a competitive global marketplace and so a competitive business environment in Scotland and across the UK is vital to Scotch Whisky‘s success,” said Betts.
“For Scotch, that means fair and balanced regulation and taxes, including excise duty, to give distillers the confidence to invest in future growth. We also want to see the UK and EU agree to an open and positive future relationship, which delivers frictionless trade with the EU, and the UK to secure ambitious trading relationships with key markets around the world.
“In that context, it is important to our industry, as to many others, that the UK does not leave the EU without a deal at the end of March. We are urging the government and Parliamentarians to work together constructively and pragmatically to ensure that an agreement is reached as quickly as possible.”
 
The largest export destinations for Scotch Whisky (by value) in 2018 were:
1 United States, £1,039.5m, +£117.8m, +12.8% (£921.7m in 2017)

Chef Paul Ainsworth and his wife Emma are extending their Cornish empire with the lease to Sharp’s Brewery-backed pub The Mariners, following the departure of Nathan Outlaw last month.
The move is the couple’s first venture outside of foodie hotspot Padstow, where they operate two restaurants and a boutique hotel, with a cookery school opening in May this year.
The Mariners pub is located across the Camel Estuary from Padstow in the fishing village of Rock.
The couple are taking over the venture from fellow chef and friend Nathan Outlaw, who described his departure last month as a “huge decision”. Outlaw had operated the pub for five years but made the decision to step away last month, after announcing in December 2018 that he was moving away from the Capital Hotel after a six-year partnership, and would be opening a new restaurant at London’s Goring Hotel.
Commenting on their new partnership, Paul Ainsworth said: “Emma and I are thrilled to be taking over The Mariners in partnership with Sharp’s Brewery. When the opportunity arose, we knew straight away that we had to take it. 2019 will very much be the ‘discovery phase’ – learning what works and what doesn’t – with a refurbishment planned for 2020.
“Nathan has done a fantastic job over the past five years and we certainly have big shoes to fill. We’re incredibly excited for what the future holds and are committed to ensuring the long-term success of The Mariners and keeping this Cornish jewel a destination for the local community and holidaymakers alike.”
Ed Hughes, beer sommelier at Sharp’s Brewery said: “We are hugely excited to announce our new partnership with Paul and Emma Ainsworth at The Mariners. Paul and his team have been great supporters of Sharp’s Brewery over the years and we can’t wait to work together on this new joint venture.
“We at Sharp’s are committed to producing quality beer from our brewery in Rock, just a mile up the road from the iconic Mariners pub. We also happily acknowledge that our skills and expertise lie in brewing beer so, to have such an amazing team running the front of house and the kitchen is a dream come true.”
Having worked under Gordon Ramsay and Marcus Wareing, Ainsworth moved to Padstow and opened No. 6 in 2005. He later relaunched the restaurant as Paul Ainsworth at No.6 in 2008 and it won a Michelin star in 2013. Ainsworth also runs Italian restaurant Rojano’s in the Square, which he acquired in 2010 and the Padstow Townhouse, launched in 2015.
Last month Paul and Emma, together with head chef John Walton, announced plans to open a cookery school and a chef’s table experience called Mahé.
The school will be based in a site adjoining No. 6 and is scheduled to open in May this year.
During the day it will operate as a cookery school with space for up to six people, while in the evening it will be turned into a chef’s table experience with a capacity for 10.

A woman’s hand reaches out to select a bottle of red wine from the shelf of a wine shop
In its 2018 Cost of Living index, The Economist Intelligence Unit compares more than 50,000 individual prices across 160 products and services including categories like food, drink, clothing, household supplies, rent, transport, and utility bills.
Prices are surveyed in the off-trade, analysing supermarkets, mid-priced stores and higher-priced speciality outlets to determine an average.
“Prices gathered are then converted into a central currency (US dollars) using the prevailing exchange rate and weighted in order to achieve comparative indices.”
In 2018, the world’s cheapest city overall was Damascus, in Syria, having fallen by 14 places in the past 12 months.
“The citizens of Damascus may not feel that the city is getting cheaper, with inflation averaging an estimated 28% in Syria during 2017,” the report said. “However, local price rises have not completely offset a near-consistent decline in the value of the Syrian pound since the onset of war in 2011.”
Within the report, the team also details how much a bottle of table wine (750 ml) would cost throughout the world’s cheapest cities, based on their overall cost of living, with the prices varying from $3.35 to $19.03.
With the exception of Damascus, Caracas in Venezuela and Lagos in Nigeria, all of the cities saw and increase in the average cost of a bottle of wine compared to the previous year.
The biggest drop was seen in Damascus, with the cost of a bottle falling by 57.6%, followed by Caracas at 20%.

Japanese artist Daido Moriyama’s Lip Bar has gone on sale at Selfridges for £80,000
Launched in time for Valentine’s Day, the bar, which claims to be the world’s smallest, features a recurring lip motif based on a photo by Moriyama.
Best known for his gritty black-and-white photography, Moriyama’s London bar is inspired by the tiny drinking dens in Golden Gai, an area of Shinjuku in Tokyo. Moriyama also designed a similar space, Bar Kuro in Tokyo, which boasts his red lip design.
His dimly lit, five square-metre London speakeasy can be booked by singletons looking for love this Valentine’s Day. An hour at the bar costs £10 and includes two Asahi beers, sort drinks or a cup of saké for you and your paramour.
While the Lip Bar is designed as a space where singles can meet and mingle, couples are also encouraged to swing by.
The Lip Bar will be open until March 3, and can also be bought outright for £80,000 as part of Selfridges’ State Of The Arts campaign, which showcases installations, limited-edition pieces and in-store displays at its UK stores.
Those keen to delve deeper into Moriyama’s work can check out his black-and-white photos of Japan’s street life on display at Selfridges’ Art Store, which brings together works from renowned galleries like the White Cube and Gagosian.
The department store’s three-month State Of The Arts project, which launched last month, promotes the work of nine different artists.
If you’re not able to score a seat at the Lip Bar, London has plenty of other diminutive drinking dens to explore.

Laurent Delaunay, head of négociant house Badet Clément, has outlined further the plans for his recently reacquired family domaine in Burgundy, ‘Edouard Delaunay’.
The Château de Charmont
Delaunay announced last month that he had reacquired his family estate from the Boisset family in 2017 and that he was relaunching the brand this February.
Speaking to the drinks business at Wine Paris, Delaunay said that the chance to buy back the domaine (which his father sold in the early 1990s) had “always been a dream”.
His company, Badet Clément, has invested extensively in the south of France over the past few decades but he continued he had always kept numerous contacts in Burgundy and had continued living there.
Delaunay said that one day he had simply asked Jean-Claude Boisset if he would ever sell the domaine name and châteu back and “he [Boisset] accepted immediately”.
At the same time, “by coincidence”, the old cellars and winery which had been sold to another company also came up for sale so very quickly he was able to assemble the original framework of the estate.
The only thing that was missing were vineyards as Boisset retained the 13 hectares that used to belong to the domaine.
Delaunay said it was another “dream to buy some of our own vineyards,” but conceded that in Burgundy today such a desire was, “very difficult and expensive but we’re looking at opportunities and if a good one arrives we’ll take it.”
As such, all the grapes have been sourced through contracts, which Delaunay said had been the hardest part of the whole project.
‘Everything else is just finance and investing,” he said (and €1.5 million has so far been invested in the winery), “but grape contracts is all about personal relations.”
Luckily, he went on, there were a number of existing connections which allowed for some quick agreements and then the return of the family apparently prompted other growers to approach him and offer fruit from climats which are otherwise extremely hard to source.
“The range we built in two years I would never have dreamed of before,” he said.
The range currently stands at 25 wines from the Côte de Beaune and Côtes de Nuits covering Villages to Grands Crus and another four wines under the broader ‘regional appellations’ in Burgundy: Bourgogne rouge and blanc and Côte d’Or Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.
As well as a Nuits-Saint-Georges village wine there are three premiers crus from the Nuits with Delaunay saying he wanted to have a “focus” on the appellation because it was “our village” – the old family house being in the Hauts Côtes de Nuits.
But he added he was most pleased to have tracked down parcels of Montrachet and Griotte-Chambertin which are extremely hard to source and the latter in particular was his father’s favourite.
In total the domaine works with five grands crus, rising to seven for the 2018 vintage.
In terms of distribution Delaunay said there was still much to put in place. He said he had 10 key markets in mind including the UK, US and China.
In the UK he wanted to aim at the high-end on-trade and very select retail outlets as well as fine wine specialists to take small allocations for private customers.
The US, he said, would not be a huge focus as many Burgundian houses were already well established there which made “profitability difficult”.
In China, however, a deal had already been struck with a company that’s a Burgundy specialist there and will sell largely to private customers.
And this market in particular, Delaunay continued, was the sort he wanted to capture for the next stage of the redevelopment of the estate.
Although the winemaking philosophy of the estate was very much Burgundian, he said, when it came to marketing, “we took more inspiration from Champagne, they pay attention to their customers, the packaging the service and so on.”
The goal, still in a planning and development stage has to how exactly it will be done, is to make the estate’s customers (particularly collectors) the sense they are “part of a venture”.
This may take the form of a wine club as exists in Napa, a guest house has also been mooted as have a series of programmes to help introduce people to what is to outsiders a very exclusive and often daunting region – “such as a weekend at the Hospices sale,” Delaunay suggested.
This is where the Chinese market comes in, with Delaunay noting that they are the, “type of client who wants to know more about Burgundy and who find it the most difficult [to get access].”

“We’re definitely seeing more people looking for something different to gin. They’re overwhelmed by the number of gin brands on offer and are saying to us ‘Oh good, you’re not doing a gin’.
“When you think that at one show, you can have as many as 14 to 20 different gin brands battling it out, you can see why some consumers are getting a bit bored of it.
Ogilvy makes vodka produced from potatoes grown on the family farm near Forfar in Angus.
While Bruce-Jarron has seen evidence of ‘gin fatigue’, the category still remains in growth. In the year ending 3 November 2018, gin sales in the UK alone reached almost £2 billion with UK gin sales by volume totalling 66.3 million bottles, up 41% on 2017, and £1.93 billion by value, up 53%.
Bruce-Jarron added: “I think there’s still a long way to go – the word vodka does put a lot of people off. Our job is to show people that we make a product that tastes good and has flavour. Perceptions are definitely changing.”
Stephen Russell co-founder of Copper Rivet in Kent, which produces Vela Vodka, agrees.
“We cannot say that ‘craft vodka’ is a major trend yet in the way it has been for gin, but there’s momentum in that direction,” he said.
“The clear trend we’re seeing is a shift among discerning consumers towards seeking out more artisan, less showy brands with a real story to tell – for example, in our case, the process and the wheat, barley and rye which are grown locally and exclusively for us.
“Consumers also seem keen to enjoy vodka which has some character – so rather than being totally flavourless, we find consumers at the luxury end of the market enjoying being able to identify a hint of sweetness, warmth and creaminess,” he added.

Keith Bonnington director of Colonsay Beverages, owner of Brochan Vodka, said that there are similarities in the way that raw materials are discussed by vodka producers and botanicals are mentioned by gin distillers.
“There has been a slow but steady swell of consumer interest in the premium craft vodka category over the last ten years, initially focussed on brands from mainland Europe and Russia but increasingly in recent years, from within the UK, talking up raw materials in much the same way gin producers do for botanicals,” he said.
“Arguably, the flavour variation derived from cereals is far more subtle than that which can be attributed to botanicals but there’s enough there to pique the consumer’s interest.”
Bruce-Jarron is among those calling for better regulations, particularly highlighting the plight of those producers making their spirit from scratch, often by growing the raw materials themselves.
“Firstly, we need more regulation between vodkas and gins that are not particularly juniper-led. Secondly, there are also a lot of producers, particularly in Scotland, that are buying in their base spirits and saying they’re Scottish.
“Of course there are a lot of great products that can be made in this way, but we, and others that do what we do, are frustrated and feel consumers are being misled as to what they’re drinking.
“There are other problems too: brands calling themselves distilleries when they don’t actually have a distillery, and are producing their products through contract distilling.
“We’re in a wee bit of a mess. With so many brands popping up, it’s hard to keep control of it all. We definitely need better regulation for better credibility.”
Ian Stirling, founder of Arbikie, another Scottish spirits producer employing the field-to-bottle approach, likewise believes traceability and being honest to the customer is vital.
“At Arbikie we’re one of the few UK distillers who grow and distil from scratch. We grow our own potatoes to distil our Tattie Bogle Potato Vodka which is then used as the base spirit for Kirsty’s Gin. Our Haar Vodka is distilled from our own wheat and used to distil AK’s Gin, thus giving full traceability for our consumers.
“Although it costs us a lot more to distil from scratch, we will never use bought-in neutral grain spirit as it often lacks traceability of production and the materials it was distilled from,” he said.
Steven Kersley, head of distillation at BrewDog’s distilling arm, LoneWolf, agrees, adding that vodka must improve its act if it is to compete with the rise of gin and rum.
“The growth across other spirits categories has meant vodka has taken a back seat of late. That said the strong performance of gin and rum etc. isn’t solely to blame.
“The custodians of this category have done it a disservice. Authenticity is lacking. Mass procured neutral grain spirit dressed up in a premium bottle, for me, has no real tangible quality edge on the value brands. The difference in price is a ‘wanker tax.'”

Champagne Castelnau has launched a rosé gift box, complete with re-designed packaging, for its NV expression ahead of Valentine’s Day.
Champagne Castelnau Rosé NV gift box
Champagne Castelnau Rosé NV is a blend of 50% Pinot Meunier, 30% Chardonnay and 20% Pinot Noir.
Aged on its lees for nearly five years, the cuvée is a soft pink in colour and offers notes of “ripe black cherry flavours and lightly toasted notes” with a “flourish of small red fruit aromas” on the nose, leading to notes of toasted almonds on the palate.
“Valentine’s Day is an important date for the Champagne calendar and we are delighted to present this dramatic innovation, which would make an already special occasion into an unforgettable one with the gesture of a such a unique gift,” said managing director of Champagne Castelnau, Pascal Prudhomme.
The “retro-modern design” of the box features an “explosion of intense red, punctuated with white, black and grey bursts, creating an emotive optical effect”.
The Champagne Castelnau Rosé NV gift box is available to UK customers via Castelnau Wine Agencies, with an RRP of £35.

Taylor’s has announced the release of the 1969 Single Harvest 50 year-old tawny Port, the latest in its range of limited edition Ports.
The 1969 is the sixth release so far in the Single Harvest series and is currently available in the UK through Taylor’s distributor Mentzendorff.
Adrian Bridge, Taylor’s managing director, said: “Taylor’s owes its leadership of the aged tawny category to its extensive reserves of very old Port maturing in oak cask. These allow it to offer the full range of 10, 20, 30 and 40 Year Old tawnies as well as rare Single Harvest Ports of interest to both the wine enthusiast and collector.
“Taylor’s 1969 Single Harvest Port is the sixth in a magnificent series of limited edition Ports, released when 50 years old. It is an absolutely exceptional wine, a superb example of the art of wood ageing refined by Taylor’s over the generations.”
The 1969 vintage had one of the highest winter rainfalls on record, followed by a hot July and August but the cool start to the summer meant harvesting did not begin until early October.
Aged for 50 years in oak casks at Taylor’s lodge in Gaia, the wine today is described as having a “deep mahogany” colour, “wild honey” and “cigar box aromas” on the nose and “perfectly calibrated palate…lifted by a fresh acidity,” with, “molasses, dried figs, sultanas and apricot confit”.

Anticipation over the release of Sassicaia’s 2016 vintage has caused a flutter of activity on the Liv-ex Exchange, with prices quickly shooting upwards.
The Super Tuscan’s UK agent, Armit Wines, invited clients to register their interest in the wines from Tenuta San Guido this week – including Sassicaia, and the 2017 vintages of Guidalberto and Le Difese.
Excellent as the other labels are, all eyes were naturally on the Sassicaia which has followed up what was a brilliant 2015 (across Bolgheri) with an equally strong 2016.
The Wine Advocate’s Monica Larner gave the wine 100-points saying it “stands tall next to the epic 1985 vintage that set the ultimate benchmark for vino italiano”.
Fellow America James Suckling meanwhile gave it a 97-98 point spread while praising its “seamless texture and great composure”.
As well as the early critical praise, spicing things up further was the price. Offered at £635 per six so £1,270 per dozen it is one of the cheapest vintages available from the last 10 years and it has the best WA score of the last 10 years as well.
Bids and offers on Liv-ex rapidly began to hit prices in excess of £2,000. At a peak an offer even appeared for £1,350 for six – which was accepted.
Like all flutters such activity was brief and prices have settled back a little since then but speaking to the drinks business, Liv-ex co-director Justin Gibbs said it is there for a reason – the market is excited about the 2016 Super Tuscans.
“The market’s waiting with baited breath,” he said. “It realises there’s a good vintage on its hands and they’re brands with momentum behind them.”
Tignanello was another label he said there seemed to be some excitement about as well.
As with Bordeaux labels or non-claret ‘first growths’ like Opus One, Gibbs added that the Super Tuscans tended to work because they were “strong brands with decent production”.
“They’re the first growths of their regions and at a fraction of the price. Not like for like but you can see the appeal.”
For Sassicaia, the 100 WA points, the reference to the famous 1985, its relative value, the limited amount of stock available both due to the fact that most countries haven’t received their allocations yet and because a short 2017 vintage has prompted rumours the estate is holding some stock back this year have all combined to create a brief but furious little storm.
Gibbs cautioned that real interest in both Sassicaia and the other 2016 Super Tuscans could not be truly assessed until more stock had actually been released but, “I think Tuscany has got something going and has momentum and clearly this ‘16 vintage is going to be exciting. If you take Sassicaia and Tignanello as the starting gun, it seems something’s up.”

London wine bar Humble Grape is preparing to launch a third crowdfunding campaign to fund a new wine bar in Canary Wharf.
The company is launching an EIS equity investment round on Seedrs next month to raise £500,000 for the new wine-bar – its fifth – in London’s financial district.
In an email to potential investors, the company said it had secured the lease for the prime site, which it said had very little competition in the wine space, and the potential to add around £2- £2.5 million revenue to the group.
“The site EBITDA is well above the industry standard of 20% despite the current market,” it said, adding that the site could reach a “great demographic”.
Investments are set to start at a few hundred pounds with some investors investing between £5,000 to £50,000, it said.
The independent wine bar and importer, which focuses on importing handcrafted, organic, and biodynamic wines direct from the producer, already has four sites across the capital, in Fleet Street, Battersea, Islington and Liverpool Street.
The company’s last crowdfunding drive in April 2017 raised nearly £1.3million, which was raised to fund its third and fourth sites in London, with the company planning to open a further two – four sites each year, with the ultimate aim of around 20-sites.
At the time founder James Dawson told db he would like to take the brand beyond its London heartland and establish a foothold in Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool by 2020. Speaking to db in 2017, he said he envisaged these conforming to two different models – a city centre wine bar with a simple food proposition and small retail offer, like its Fleet Street bar, or a large ‘neighbourhood’ site, with a bigger food offering, like its Battersea shop.

Amid falling sales of flagship beers, Californian beer brand Anchor Brewing is supporting a new initiative called Flagship February with promotional events and puppy pictures.
Anchor Brewing has enlisted the help of some young recruits to help promote Flagship February.
Celebrating its flagship beer, Anchor Steam, the San Francisco-based brewer is supporting the global marketing initiative, founded this year by beer writers Stephen Beaumont and Jay Brooks.
As part of the month-long campaign, at its San Francisco tap room on De Haro Street, Anchor will be serving its unfiltered Steam beer on tap and will be offering an Anchor Steam pint card program, offering a free t-shirt for every 10 points notched up.
Earlier this month, it also teamed up with Family Dog Rescue to host a fundraising and adoption event, providing the perfect opportunity to create some dog-inspired marketing material.
A number of taprooms and breweries across the world are taking part in the Flagship February initiative, including Michigan’s B. Nektar, Pennsylvania’s Yuengling and Great Lakes Brewing in Ohio. For the full programme of events, please click here.
The campaign’s main sponsors are New Belgium’s Fat Tire brand and Boston Beer’s Sam Adams lager.
Speaking about the initiative, Beaumont told Forbes: “A lot of beer drinkers have developed a sort of ADD with respect to the beers they drink, so going for a glass of beer at the bar or pub becomes less a pleasant distraction and more a relentless search for what’s new and exciting.
“In this mad rush towards the unusual and unknown, we tend to forget the great, familiar and still-wonderful beers that guided us all along the path to the craft beer renaissance.”
On Twitter, he added: “Just because a beer is new or unusual doesn’t mean that it’s good, and in my non-professional time I’ve found myself retreating more and more to proven greats rather than the ballyhooed unknowns of the ‘special release’ world.
“Of course, as a beer writer focused on new releases, I have to take my share of the blame for the current state of affairs, so I guess this is part of my penance.”

One of Sauvignon Blanc’s biggest problems is the fact that the wine trade views it “like a crossbreed puppy – cute but lacking in class and complexity”, according to New Zealander Sam Harrop MW.
The wine trade views Kiwi Sauvignon like “a crossbreed puppy”, according to Sam Harrop MW
Speaking at the second International Sauvignon Blanc Celebration in Marlborough earlier this month, Harrop told the audience: “People in the trade view Sauvignon Blanc like a crossbreed puppy – cute but lacking in class and complexity, which I don’t think is true at all. Most people who think that are locked in a complex and dysfunctional relationship with Burgundy.
“In their minds there isn’t enough choice and diversity with Sauvignon Blanc, and not enough of the pixie dust that they call context, but the grape has vast potential for diversity and site expression.
“In order to safeguard its reputation, we need to start the journey of changing the elitist view of Sauvignon Blanc as being a one-trick pony and embrace the idea of Sauvignon Blanc as a chameleon that changes depending on where its grown.
“We need to elevate Sauvignon Blanc from a savage white to a noble variety, and tell the story to the world. It’s a misconception that the grape can’t improve with age – it has all the fundamentals to do just that.
Sam Harrop MW is keen to change perceptions of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc
Harrop went on to explain the difference between “wines of style” and “wines of site” with a sense of place, linking the latter to the Māori concept of tūrangawaewae, meaning “a place to stand” where you feel at home.
“Some wines have a weak sense of place others have an abundance. Rioja and Marlborough Sauvignon are examples of wines of style that require a greater level of winemaker intervention and end up tasting of nowhere and everywhere at the same time.
“However, even at commercial price points Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has a sense of place despite being a wine of style.
“Today we produce great volumes of Sauvignon Blanc with a generic sense of place. We need to focus on Marlborough’s sub-regions, which is part of the next step to changing perceptions,” Harrop said.
“We need to look to the Loire sub-regions of Sancerre, Touraine and Pouilly-Fumé for inspiration. The village model in Sancerre is the way to go and will add a halo effect to the commodity level that is so important for many growers.
“More work is needed to further understand the sense of place of Marlborough’s different sub-regions, which will be an investment in the future of Sauvignon Blanc. We’re hot on sustainability and now need to invest in diversity,” he added.
Harrop warned that this sub-regional approach will require a drop in volumes, but that the increase in the quality and value of the wines will be worth it in the long run.
“Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has the opportunity to produce wines of site. These wines won’t be ordered by the boatload at the beginning, but people will be willing to pay more for them in the long run.
“There needs to be a generational shift and we need to get the growers on board. We need to encourage growers to look at the long-term plan rather than the short-term monetary goal. The development of Appellation Marlborough is a good first step,” he said.
“We’re not genuinely invested in sub-regionality at the moment. Most producers haven’t invested a business plan in making these smaller volume single site wines, so the message isn’t getting across to consumers and the trade. We’ve been making single vineyard wines but we haven’t been selling them. We need to get them out there and put context behind them,” he added.

Sir Ian McKellen 

One of our most beloved (and talented) actors, Sir Ian McKellen, is a landlord in his spare time, having snapped up The Grapes pub in Limehouse in 2012. A onetime haunt of Charles Dickens, who references the pub in his novel Our Mutual Friend, the riverside pub offers a cosy retreat from the bustle of the city.
Dickens describes it thus: “A tavern of dropsical appearance, long settled down into a state of hale infirmity. It had outlasted many a sprucer public house, indeed the whole house impended over the water but seemed to have got into the condition of a faint-hearted diver, who has paused so long on the brink that he will never go in at all.” You’ll find the complete works of Dickens in the pub’s parlour.
The Monday night quiz has become something of an institution, not least because you may be lucky enough to get McKellen on your team. The pub dates back to 1583, when it was then known as The Bunch of Grapes.
McKellen recounts in a brief history of the pub on its website that Sir Walter Raleigh set sail on his third voyage to the New World from directly beneath The Grapes. More recently, artist Francis Bacon lived down the road at number 80.

Distributor Gonzalez Byass will host its annual UK portfolio tasting, with a series of talks and masterclasses headed up by some of the group’s newest recruits.

The trade tasting, which will take place on Monday 11 February, will host a Speaker’s Corner for the first time this year, with industry insiders such as Mark & Sarah Driver from English winery Rathfinny and Katie Jones from Languedoc estate Domaine Jones sharing their personal experiences of running a family wine business.
Katie Jones, winemaker and owner of the Domaine Jones on the Languedoc-Roussillon border, appointed Gonzalez Byass UK as its distributor in May last year, with the aim of focussing on the independent and on trade sectors.
The trade show will allow buyers to sample a range of brands from the company’s Spanish wine and sherry offerings, as well as labels from its wider global portfolio.
In addition, the event, which will take place in London’s Oxo Tower, will also host a series of masterclasses. Winery director Roman Horvath MW will lead a tutored tasting of wines from Domäne Wachau, which formed a UK distribution partnership with Gonzalez Byass in July last year.

Atul Kochhar, the first Indian chef in the world to receive a Michelin star, has announced plans to open a new restaurant called Kanishka in March that will showcase cuisine from India’s lesser-known regions.
Chef Atul Kochhar will open Kanishka in March 2019
The new restaurant will be located on Mayfair’s Maddox Street, in London, and is a joint partnership between Kochhar and Tina English, another recognised innovator of London’s Indian dining scene, having previously worked as commercial director for Indian Restaurants Limited to develop The Cinnamon restaurant brand.
Kochhar made a name for himself while working at Tamarind in Mayfair, which won a Michelin star in 2001. He left to open Benares in 2002, which was awarded its own Michelin star four years later.
Kanishka will showcase the cuisine of territories “previously unexplored” by London’s restaurants, particularly the Seven Sister States in the most easternmost region of India.
Speaking of his new venture, Kochhar said: “Kanishka is a very exciting project for us – it’s a great opportunity to continue to showcase Indian flavours alongside quality British produce, but also introduce London’s diners to the unique flavours of territories previously unexplored by Indian cuisine in the UK.”
Using seasonal and locally sourced British produce where possible, dishes will include: Kachela Maas, a Sikkim inspired venison tartare with mustard oil mayonnaise, naan crouton and onions; Samundri Khazana Alleppey, a dish of pan seared seafood, Alleppey sauce and smoked cabbage poriyal; and Chocolate rasmalai, a milk-based dessert popular in eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Drinks will also be a key element in Kanishka’s offering, with signature cocktails including the Roast Banana Old Fashioned, made from Tandoor roasted banana with cinnamon, orange and pecan bitters, maple, and the more savoury Ingrita, made from Mezcal served with a chilled lightly spiced tomato broth. ‘Kanishka’s World of Imagination’ meanwhile will allow diners to create their own highball drink from a menu of herb and spice distillates, mixed with a choice of naturally flavoured tonic waters and their spirit of choice.
Kanishka’s extensive whisky menu will showcase over 50 types of whisky, with a unique selection sourced from India.
The restaurant itself is named after King Kanishka, an emperor of the Kushan dynasty in the second century, who practised the Buddhist values of including kindness, fairness, honesty, humbleness and a sense of equality. On arriving at the restaurant, guests will be greeted by topiary elephants and an antique front door, whilst inside will feature verdant foliage against calming shades of blue and intricate beaded details. Split across the ground and basement floors, the 127-cover space includes a bar, a terrace at the front, and an intimate, 12-cover garden room downstairs.

The Coop is trialling booze delivery in London with on-demand delivery service Deliveroo, as it also unveiled ambitious plans for rolling out ‘milestone’ franchise stores.
According to The Sun the convenience store is trialling delivery from eleven London stores, including Wandsworth, Wimbledon, Southwark, Chelsea and Regents Park.
Orders on a selection of beers, ciders, wines and spirits, and some snacks, ready meals and store cupboard essentials can be delivered within a 2-3km radius within 10-20 minutes, it said, for a £3 delivery charge.
The tie-up follows a trial of the service in five stores in Greater Manchester which was launched last January.
Products included for delivery include Desperados, Brewdog’s Punk IPA, ciders from Henry Weston’s Cider, Kopparberg and Strongbow, the retailer’s own label wines along with Moet and Chandon Imperial Brut, Blossom Hill, Hardys Voyage and Adeletto Prosecco, and Sipsmith’s London Dry gin and the Kraken’s Black spiced rum.
A spokesman for the Co-op said: “We have extended a partnership with Deliveroo to make access to our products and services even easier for consumers.”
Significant milestone
The retailer has also rolled out plans for a ‘significant number’ of franchise stores, following a recent trial, the first time it has licensed its brand name to independent retailers. It started a trial of the concept last spring, and is due to open its fourth franchise this month, but is now ‘actively recruiting’ indies, a move that marked as a “significant milestone’ in its ambition, according to Martin Rogers, head of new channels.
“We have been trialling our franchise model since last spring, with our fourth store opening this month, and we have seen a minimum 50 per cent uplift on sales in these stores. We now have the capability to deliver franchising at scale, offering our award-winning food, in new places to attract new customers and members,” he said.
As well as sharing the name, the franchisees will be able to stock The Co-op own brand product, which is already available to around 4,000 Nisa stores following its acquisition of that wholesale business.

Diageo has submitted plans to convert a building in the heart of Edinburgh’s shopping district into a visitor centre for its blended Scotch whisky brand Johnnie Walker.
The drinks giant has stated that the new visitor attraction will be the “focal point” of its £150 million investment to boost Scotch whisky tourism.
Jointly submitted by Diageo and building owner Parabola, the planning application details proposals to convert 146 Princes Street into a seven-floor visitor experience.
The plans include a “multi-sensory, immersive visitor experience” over three floors, covering the brand’s 200-year history as well as the art of whisky production.
The building will also include a “flexible events space” capable of staging arts, music, theatre and community events; a bar academy which will be home to Diageo’s Learning for Life programme that provides hospitality training for the unemployed; and a “significant retail space” inspired by the Johnnie Walker retail store in Madrid.
Diageo hopes that the new attraction, which will also boast roof-top bars, will create between 160 and 180 full-time jobs and boost the tourism spend in Edinburgh by around £135 million.
As part of the project, the building, along with its many heritage features, will be restored and incorporated into the new development where possible. This includes the refurbishment of the clock on the corner of Princes Street and Hope Street, which traditionally acted as a meeting point for Edinburgh dwellers.
David Cutter, chairman of Diageo in Scotland, commented: “We are incredibly excited to be able to submit our plans for the Johnnie Walker visitor experience in Edinburgh.
“The location is one of Edinburgh’s most exceptional landmark buildings and we plan to restore it to its former glory as a cornerstone of the city and a thriving part of its cultural and social life.
“We have the most passionate and skilled whisky-makers in the world here in Scotland and we want to celebrate their craft and everything that is great about Scotland and whisky.”
Cristina Diezhandino, Diageo global Scotch whisky director, said: “Johnnie Walker is the leading international whisky brand, with truly global reach and we believe our plans will create a flagship attraction that will bring people to Scotland from the four corners of the world.
“Our ambition is to create a visitor experience that will rank not only as one of the greatest whisky attractions of the world, but one of the greatest brand attractions in any industry, putting Scotland at the forefront of the global boom in experiential travel.”
Four of Diageo’s distilleries – Glenkinchie, Cardhu, Caol Ila and Clynelish – will be directly linked to the visitor centre and will represent “the four corners of Scotland” with respect to regional flavour variations and blending.
As well as its Johnnie Walker visitor centre, Diageo is also investing in 12 visitor attractions across Scotland and has committed to a £35 million to reopen the “lost” distilleries of Port Ellen and Brora.
In October 2018, the Highland Council approved its plans for the Brora distillery which include restoring its original buildings, which date to 1819, and demolishing then rebuilding its still house stone-by-stone.
Last month, Diageo also unveiled its plans for Port Ellen The plans, which feature two separate distillation regimes which will allow the distillery to both retain its original character and to experiment with different flavour profiles.

Gordon & Macphail 1948
Gordon & MacPhail has launched its oldest release yet as part of its ‘Private Collection’: Gordon & MacPhail 1948 from Glen Grant Distillery. At 70 years old, it is the oldest expression from the Speyside distillery ever bottled. The rare single malt was matured in Cask 2154, a first-fill Sherry butt filled on 11 June 1948 – six years before barley rationing restrictions were lifted after World War II.
Bottled at 48.6%, the whisky is presented in an engraved crystal decanter. Only 210 decanters are available. It follows the 50-year-old Gordon & MacPhail 1968 from Caol Ila Distillery, the oldest single malt bottled by the Islay distillery.
RRP: £17,500.

The 2018 winner of the BBC cooking competition MasterChef and former bank manager, Kenny Tutt, is to open his first restaurant in Worthing called Pitch.

The menu, created with ingredients sourced locally, will focus on classic British dishes with a twist and feature Kenny Tutt’s own take on egg and chips alongside doughnuts with whipped goats cheese and cereal panna cotta with peanut butter.  Cream teas and seafood will also be available.  The wine list is yet to be unveiled.
Hailed by MasterChef judges as a “brilliant champion” for his unusual dishes, Tutt wants his first venture to be “somewhere people can relax and feel comfortable in an atmosphere that still feels special, without that stiff upper lip attitude”. His food will pay homage to his home town of London.
Located on Worthing’s Warwick Street, the former site of Italian restaurant Nonna’s Kitchen, Pitch will cover two floors and include a private dining room, with plans to open a cookery school on the top floor later this year. Pitch will open in May.

Drizly, the ‘Amazon for Liquor’, has boosted its presence on the West Coast by teaming up with drinks retailer BevMo!

The partnership adds 45 BevMo! stores, to the Boston-based tech company’s e-commerce platform from today, spanning across California from Silicon Valley to San Diego and Los Angeles.
Drizly, which launched in 2012, already has a network of around 1,000 local stores in more than 100 cities in the US and Canada. It’s platform, dubbed the ‘Amazon of Liquor’ allows shoppers to compare the price of drinks in shops in their neighbourhood and order on-demand through the website and app. It also offers tips and cocktail recipes and trend information, while supplying its retail partners with its technology to enable them to offer id-verified delivery to customers.
Bryan Goodwin, SVP of commercial sales and operations at Drizly said BevMo!, which operates a total of 170 stores across California, Arizona and Washington, shared its innovative mindset, and the partnership would take its “already strong” west coast presence to “a new level”.
“BevMo!’s presence on Drizly includes their legendary ClubBev deals, making it easy for their loyal shoppers to enjoy a full BevMo! experience through just a few taps on their phones or laptops,” Goodwin added.
In December Drizly secured around $34.5 million in investment according to a SEC filing reported by Tech Crunch. 
Last month BevMo! launched a trial of a voice-activated ‘smart-aisle’ AI assistant to ‘talk whiskey’ to its customers, following a partnership with shopping marketing specialists, The Mars Agency.

English winery Nyetimber has released a Valentine’s Day campaign entitled ‘A Love Shared’ inspired by its husband and wife winemaking team Cherie Spriggs and Brad Greatrix.
Spriggs and Greatrix have worked together at the winery since 2007, having first met during their undergraduate Biochemistry degrees.
The campaign celebrates the “shared passions that unite us as couples and as friends this Valentine’s Day.”
In a video launched alongside the campaign, Spriggs says: “The most difficult thing about wine is putting words to it. Having been together for almost 20 years we kind of know each other’s language.
“With something as subjective as wine you know it’s a sensory experience we go through that we process together.
“We’re working in an industry that ultimately the goal is about making something for joy, for pleasure, for celebration. That’s why we do what we do.”
The English wine producer has also teamed equestrian duo William and Alice Fox-Pitt, who both share a passion for horses. William spent 35 years competing in eventing, winning three Olympic medals and six World Championship medals.
Alice is a former eventer and National Hunt jockey who now works and presents for ITV Racing.
Both firm fans of Nyetimber, the couple said in the video.
“If you look at the people who have tried to work together it’s a very challenging thing to do, so I think it’s very important to keep something for yourself. The best sporting we’ve enjoyed together was when we had this amazing opportunity, we were invited to go racing with Her Majesty the Queen. It was an amazing day, we’ll never forget that for sure.
“There isn’t ever a bad time to have a bottle of Nyetimber… You have to enjoy the moment and never wait to celebrate.”
Nyetimber will be publishing a video to complete the trio today.

The proposed merger between two of the UK’s largest supermarkets is on the rocks after the CMA said it found “extensive competition concerns” that Sainsbury’s and Asda were unlikely to be able to resolve.
Publishing its provisional findings this morning ahead of a final decision in April, the CMA said the proposed merger would result in “a substantial lessening of competition at both a national and local level”, with the likelihood of prices being pushed up and quality and choice reduced.
Stuart Mcintosh, chair of the independent inquiry group carrying out the investigation, said this would lead to a “worse experience for in-store and online shoppers across the UK”.
Although he underlined that the findings were provisional and the companies and others now had the opportunity to respond, the CMA also stated its current view that it was “likely to be difficult” for the two retailers to address the concerns it had identified.
One option to recreate the competitive rivalry lost through the merger could be to require the merging companies to sell off a significant number of stores and other assets, it said – potentially including one of the Sainsbury’s or Asda brands – it said.
“These are 2 of the biggest supermarkets in the UK, with millions of people purchasing their products and services every day,” he said. “It’s our responsibility to carry out a thorough assessment of the deal to make sure that the sector remains competitive and shoppers don’t lose out.”
Sainsbury’s and Asda hit back, issuing a joint-statement that said the findings “fundamentally misunderstand how people shop in the UK today and the intensity of competition in the grocery market”.
It claimed the CMA has “moved the goalposts” and provided an inconsistent analysis with comparable cases, ignoring the benefit of synching the two retailer’s costs.
“Combining Sainsbury’s and Asda would create significant cost savings, which would allow us to lower prices,” it reiterated. “We are surprised that the CMA would choose to reject the opportunity to put money directly into customers’ pockets, particularly at this time of economic uncertainty.”
“We will be working to understand the rationale behind these findings and will continue to press our case in the coming weeks.”
Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said the CMA’s decision seemed to have dealt a “mortal blow” to the proposed merger and that Sainsbury’s reading of the decision was “bordering on laughable”.
“We always felt that 10% price cuts on unspecified products on an unspecified timeframe was playing to the galleries. Sainsbury looks like it has misunderstood the consumer and the CMA,” he said.
“For Sainsbury’s we see this as a major blow and one that removes the merger’s premium.”
The Food & Drink Federation welcomed the finding, saying it reflected the concerns of its members that the proposed merger would cause a “substantial lessening of competition at both a national and local level” and an ever more consolidated grocery market.
However Neil Parish, chair of the government’s Environment, Food & Rural Affairs Committee, said he was disappointed the report had only looked at competition on a customer level and had not reflected the impact the merger could have on businesses in the retailers’ supply chains.
“We sent a letter to the CMA last year, asking them to consider supplier views. We know that businesses working in the food industry already face intense pressure due the uncertainty of Brexit and planning for a no deal scenario,” he said, adding that the EFRA Committee would be watching the next steps of this investigation “closely”.
The deal, which was announced last April, would have seen Sainsbury’s become a subsidiary of Walmart and create a combined group worth around £13.2 billion that could transform the UK’s grocery market’s landscape by knocking Tesco off its top spot, according to KantarWorldpanel analyst Fraser McKevitt.
The retailers had initially planned to maintain both the Sainsbury’s and Asda brands and combine their network of 2,800 Sainsbury’s, Asda and Argos (a subsidiary of Sainsbury’s) stores.

Chilean winery Viña Santa Carolina has discovered a vine of Plant de Chaudefonds in one of its vineyards, a vine so rare just three other plants exist in the world.
The discovery was made at the winery’s vineyard in Totihue (in Cachapoal) in a plot of centennial vines known as the ‘Chacra Centenario’.
The block is part of a “vine material recovery project” that Santa Carolina has in place designed to recover and propagate pre-phylloxera old vine material.
The Chacra Centenario block has 14 varieties planted in it, all had been identified but one was proving particularly stubborn.
With the help of ampelographer Jean-Michel Boursiquot and some DNA analysis, the vine was eventually identified as Plant de Chaudefonds 53, a red variety originally from Chaudefonds-sur-Layon in the Loire that is all but extinct save for three plants still known to be in France.
Now that it has been successfully identified, the variety is going to be reproduced by Santa Carolina’s team working on the old vine project.
It is hoped that after further research to evaluate its potential it may be used in future blends.

Authorities in Florence and Cremona have arrested three people following the discovery of 11,000 fake bottles of Super Tuscan wines, fraudulently labelled as Antinori Tignanello.
The fake bottles were labelled as 2009, 2010 and 2011 vintages, but were discovered before being distributed.
According to Italian media reports, police have arrested three suspects: Matteo Fazzi, 31; Maria Alessandra Morini, 57; and Sergio Papa, 54, with at least six more individuals currently under investigation.
Fazzi is said to be in custody, while Morini and Papa are under house arrest.
The trio stand accused of creating copycat labels and packaging of Tignanello and filling bottles with low quality wine of unknown origin, with the intention of targeting Italy and markets abroad, particularly Belgium and Germany.
The fraud was uncovered by the Parma Public Prosecutor and Italy’s national police in Florence and Cremona, who were able to prevent the fake wine from being distributed having traced the purchase of bulk corks and printing paraphernalia to the accused.
The labels were reported to have been produced in China, which were identical to the Tignanello original, albeit with a typo of “alditudine” instead of “altitudine” (altitude).
Other printing requests were traced to Parma, with at least four companies believed to be involved in producing packaging for the fakes.
Speaking to Wine Spectator, Alessia Antinori, vice president of Marchesi Antinori, said the fakes were labeled as 2009, 2010, and 2011 Tignanello.
From the 2013 vintage, the producer has placed an embossed logo on the bottle in a bid to combat counterfeiting, which was extended to the Tignanello lettering from the 2015 vintage onward. A smaller label on bottles has also been used since 2016 in an effort to distinguish genuine from fake bottles.
At around £90 a bottle, according to Wine Searcher, the 11,000 fake bottles of Tignanello could have been worth around £1 million on the open market.
Italy has had its fair share of scandal of late, with many of the biggest European wine fraud rings appearing to have roots in the country.
In 2014, police in Sienna seized 160,000 litres of Tuscan wines labelled falsely as Brunello and Rosso di Montalcino worth an estimated €5 million.
In 2016, Italian police seized over 9,000 bottles of fake Moët & Chandon Champagne from a shed in the countryside near Padua in northern Italy worth an estimated €350,000 (£266,534). Police also found 40,000 fabricated Moët & Chandon labels in the shed, where eight people with “long criminal records” were working on the counterfeits.

Knut Hansen Gin – Dry Gin

This German gin, made by Hamburg-based distillery Knut Hansen, takes its name from a legendary sailor of the same name.
Born in September 1916, Knut Lier-Hansen was a Norwegian resistance member during World War II.
The dry gin is made using no less than 14 botanicals including apple, basil and cucumber. We recommend pairing with a clean, crisp light tonic and a cucumber slice for a refreshing tipple.
Pocketful of Stones Distillers – Caspyn Gin

Pocketful of Stones – headquartered in Long Rock, near Penzance, is providing its original Caspyn gin for our G&T bar.
The copper pot-stilled expression contains ingredients including hibiscus flowers, lemon and orange peel, lemongrass, lemon verbena, Japanese tea, gorse and orris. It’s ideal paired with a crisp tonic and a twisted orange peel, according to the company’s website.
Orkney Gin Company – Orkney Rhubarb Old Tom Gin
(Photo: Orkney Gin)
Based in Kirkwall just off the north coast of Scotland Orkney Gin Company launched the Old Tom-style gin in 2017, and has since then picked up a string of silver medals from the likes of the IWSC and Great Taste Awards.
The 43% ABV gin is a ‘celebration of rhubarb’, a plant that thrives in the Orcadian climate and can be found growing across the archipelago.
The distiller calls this spirit “summer in a bottle“, and with April marking the start of sunnier days, what better way to celebrate than with a rhubarb G&T?

New laws in the state of California mean that alcohol suppliers can now legally post photos advertising events such as winemaker dinners on social media, though video content is still prohibited.

The laws, which fall under Assembly Bill 2452, came into effect this year and state that alcohol suppliers in the state may now legally post photos of retail premises on social media in connection to a number of different types of event.
These include winemaker dinners, tastings on off-sale retail premises (with a type 86 licence) and tastings at on-sale premises.
Before this law was passed, alcohol suppliers were permitted to mention details such as the location of the event and other basic details, but pictures of retail premises were forbidden. Photo-based alcohol event advertising, according to the guidelines above, has now been approved.
These options are also available to craft distillers under Assembly Bill 1819, who are similarly not allowed to upload video content.
Under AB 1819, suppliers are allowed to mention the name, address, phone number, email address, web site and any other details mentioned on their on-sale retail licence. Also permitted to be included in the post are the names of the wines, beers and spirits being featured and the time, date and location of the event. This can be accompanied by pictures, illustrations and depictions of the premises, staff and customers.
However, posts can still not contain retail prices of the alcohol and outwardly promote the retailer’s information – it must be “relatively inconspicuous in relation to the advertisement as a whole. Laudatory references to the license-holder in these advertisements are not authorized.”
Analyzing the new laws in a recent blog post, Rebecca Stamey-White, lawyer and strategic adviser at San Francisco-based specialists in alcohol law Hinman & Carmichael, said that the so-called ‘tied house laws’ had historically stopped suppliers from advertising their retailers as it was thought it would “compromise a retailer’s independence and allow suppliers to unduly influence retailers to carry their products.”
She added: “This new California exception is in many ways unnecessary absent an intent to enforce, but it provides suppliers the certainty of knowing they can use the exception, in this modern era of Facebook and Instagram posts that heavily rely on photos, to promote the many tasting events they are participating in at retail premises across the state.”
Talking about the state of play in other US states, Stamey-White said it had not been a priority for any other state apart from Colorado, which specifically excludes social media from its tied house restrictions.
A study released in November last year revealed the power of social media advertising in the alcohol industry and particularly the sway that positive, or negative, enforcement by peers can have.

All craggy mountains and Listerine blue lakes, it’s easy to see why the winemakers here are so proud of their patch of land. This is the view of Lake Wakatipu from my hotel room. The longest lake in New Zealand, Wakatipu stretches 84 kilometres and is 400m deep. Its ‘S’ shape is said to resemble a sleeping giant.

Chicago-based auctioneer Hart Davis Hart has announced it is to hold the largest spirits-only sale ever offered in the US.
The two-day online sale from 14-15 March will feature various spirits from Scotch, Japanese and American whisky to Rum and Cognac dating back to 1898.
The sale will feature over 1,600 lots in total, worth an estimated US$1-1.6 million.
The American whiskies on offer include a 2017 bottling of 23 year-old Pappy van Winkle Bourbon; 1974 A.H. Hirsch Finest Reserve 20 year-old and rye whiskey in the shape of 14 year-old Boss Hog IV, The Black Prince, Barrel #1 by WhistlePig.
In the Armagnac consignment are bottles of 1946 Château du Busca, 1945 Château de Lassérade and 1900 Castarède while there are also decanters of Rémy Martin’s Louis XIII Grande Champagne Cognac and Louis XIII Black Pearl.
Among the rare Japanese whiskies to go under the digital hammer are a 17 year-old Hibiki, a 1977 32 year-old Karuizawa and 18 year-old Yamazaki, MIzunara Cask.
Rums include a Single Cask Demerara bottled by the famous Italian bottler Samaroli and a 26 year-old 1990 Uitvlugt Demerara.
In terms of Scotch meanwhile, bottles include a 50 year-old Macallan ‘Anniversary Malt’, a 39 year-old 1968 Bunnahabain, a 30 year-old 1979 Port Ellen and 1946 Macallan 56 year-old.
This is the first time that HDH has held such a large dedicated spirits sale and it is yet another sign of formerly very wine-focused auction houses being sure to add fine and rare spirits to their offering now due to soaring demand and prices.
Bonhams has led the field in this regard for quite some time but Sotheby’s and Christie’s have recently made it clear they intend to add more spirits to their sales in future.

In two years from now, Champagne Leclerc Briant will launch the world’s first ever fizz – or indeed any drink – that has been fermented and aged in a gold barrel.
The barrel holds 228 litres of wine and is made of stainless steel and lined with 24-carat gold. Picture credit: GD Industries
Containing wine from the 2016 harvest in Champagne, Hervé Jestin – who is head winemaker for Leclerc Briant – told the drinks business at a dinner in London last month that the gold-aged fizz would hit the market in 2021.
The barrel, which has been specially made for Leclerc Briant by GD Industries, holds 228 litres of wine, and is made of stainless steel lined with 24-carat gold, applied using electrolysis.
Jestin said that the special vessel had been filled with wine from the brand’s La Croisette vineyard, which is Leclerc Briant’s 0.6 hectare parcel of Chardonnay vines behind the producer’s winery in Epernay.
Like all Leclerc Briant’s vineyards, the plot is farmed according to the principles of biodynamic viticulture, although La Croisette is particularly prized because synthetic chemicals have never been applied to the site.
While the producer owns 14 hectares of vines, with a production of around 150-200,000 bottles annually, Leclerc Briant also buys grapes from growers across Champagne.
Because these must be farmed organically, Leclerc Briant is Champagne’s only 100% organic négociant, according to Jestin – rather than purely biodynamic.
Explaining the reason for trialling a gold-coated barrel – which he admitted was “very expensive” – he said it was due to the metal’s unique solar properties.
Commenting that there is “a resonance between solar energy and the wine”, he told db that the use of gold would, he believes, “increase the level of solar activity during the first fermentation”.
He also recorded that “gold makes a connection with cosmic activity” – an important part of biodynamic principles – while noting that the wine stored in the gold-coated barrel was “completely different” to those from the same plot that had been fermented and aged in other types of vessel.
Indeed, he is also trialling fermentations using grapes from La Croisette in oak barrels along with egg-shaped vessels made of terracotta.
Outside the wine industry, gold is renowned for its special optical properties, and hence the material’s use in satellites, cryogenics and solar cells.
However, the metal’s use in winemaking is a first, and was treated with a certain scepticism by db, which struggled to understand how the gold would affect the fermentation, other than providing an inert and impermeable container for the process.
Jestin said that he couldn’t fully account for why gold should improve the wine, but said that the gold-coated barrel, which he has patented, was highly effective.
“People might think that such experimentation is stupid, but by chance we have a crazy idea that appears to be making a powerful improvement to the process,” he said.

Meanwhile, speaking more generally about biodynamics – which is a form of organic agriculture based on the ideas of the Austrian philosopher, Rudolph Steiner, and sees producers plant, fertilise and harvest according to lunar and cosmic cycles – he said that it may comprise seemingly strange methods, but produces brilliant results.
“We are here to make a great wine, and for that you must experiment, and try to understand how nature works, and we have found that biodynamics is very interesting, and we are not alone: for example, Château Latour, Ausone, Palmer have moved to biodynamics, and Roederer now have more than 200ha farmed this way,” he said.
Although Leclerc Briant is the first producer to employ gold in its winemaking vessels, it is not the only winery to create barrels out of an extremely expensive inert material.
As reported by db last month, glassmaker Lalique has created an exact replica of a 225-litre barrique made of crystal and filled it with Sauternes to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey.
The barrel itself took over two years to make and used a technique known as ‘lost-wax casting’ that was used extensively by Lalique up until 1930 but is rarer today as it is used for objects cast in one go and so requires an immense degree of skill.

Though it has a population smaller than Piers Morgan’s follower count on Twitter, New Zealand has the potential to become a global craft brewing powerhouse, with an estimated value of over $2.3 billion (£1.2 billion).

There are now 218 breweries in New Zealand, according to a report by the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER). Since 2008, the industry has grown by an average of 16% per year in terms of brewery numbers, according to the report, which found that these businesses provide a “significant” contribution to the NZ economy.
With a population of roughly 4.8 million, the antipodean nation has more breweries per capita (4.56 per 100,000) than the UK (3.04), Australia (2.10) and the USA (1.96). The beer industry contributed $646 million to GDP in the year to March 2018, and employed roughly 22,000 people, approximately 0.5% of the population.
“In the past few years we have seen a lot more excitement about beer and the growing range of styles and taste experiences it offers consumers,” Dylan Firth, the executive director of the Brewers Association of New Zealand, said.
“But to acknowledge what the industry contributes in an economic sense is important too.”
In 2010 there were just five craft breweries with a an economic output of just NZ$3 million, according to a report by Grow Wellington.
Stu McKinlay, the founder of New Zealand-based craft brewer Yeastie Boys, told the drinks business that the nation’s own rapid growth came as a result of a “dearth of choice that existed in the existing market when microbrewing (and laterly ‘craft beer’) kicked off.”
“NZ hops, which are delicious and unique, also played a big part in the excitement. Beer suddenly had flavour that was worth talking about.”
While the sector’s GDP contribution pales in comparison to the UK, where Scotland’s beer and pub economy alone is worth £1.6 billion, New Zealand’s growth as a brewing nation is “a mightily impressive feat” considering its size, freelancer beer writer James Beeson told the drinks business.
Unlike the New Zealand’s wine market, the brewing industry is largely focused on domestic consumers. Just 10% of New Zealand’s beer is exported, compared to 70% of wine, according to the report. Tourists spent $242 million on local beers when they visited NZ last year, which Firth said indicated that the country has “a growing reputation internationally as a beer tourism destination.”
However Beeson, who left his reporting role at UK publication the Morning Advertiser to work at a NZ brewery last year, said that local businesses are stuck in a “Catch 22 situation” as they may struggle to compete in a saturated international market.
“I think this is a bit of a Catch 22 situation for NZ breweries,” he said.
“On the one hand obviously the local market is always going to be hugely important but with such as small native population base I think it’s hard for a brewery in New Zealand to gain a truly global reputation without focusing on growing their export market.”
In the UK and US there are already signs that the craft beer industry is becoming saturated. A total of 430 new breweries opened in the UK in the year ending 31 December 2017, according to UHY Hacker Young. This represents a slowdown from 2016, which saw a record 520 new brewery openings, reflecting fears that independent brewers “have been hit by rising ingredients costs caused by a slump in the pound”.
Similarly, McKinlay said he thinks that the export of beer in general is “a dying market.”
Yeastie boys, which was launched in New Zealand in 2008, now also produces beer in Australia and the UK.
“The reason for brewing in market is that I think the export of beer, in general, is a dying market… or at least quite unsustainable,” he said.
“What we’ve seen in virtually every export market is a good start – for a year or two – and then a gradual decline as the local craft beer market matures and locally brewed beer becomes a much better value proposition for customers.”
Beeson said that, while the future of craft beer is “inherently local”, NZ brewers who wish to grow their exports will need to differentiate themselves from the rest of the market with “high end products with longer shelf lives.”
“These are the products that are going to sell over in the UK, and will be able to command the price point that imported pales, lagers and IPAs won’t be able to by comparison.”
McKinlay, on the other hand, thinks strong partnerships and investments are the key to growing exports.
“Most importantly, they need to be very realistic about how much potential there is there and what they’re looking to gain from it.”

The Distilled Spirits Council has called on the US government to resolve the “harmful” export tariffs that have caused a “sharp downturn” in whiskey exports to its biggest export market.
The latest stats from the trade body showed buoyant whiskey exports to the EU have been hit hard by Trump’s tariffs wars. The EU is the US’s largest market for whiskey worth around $675m and had been growing at 33% in the first half of the year. However the annual figures showed there was a sharp downturn after tariffs were introduced, with exports to the EU falling by 8.7% to $312million from $363million, compared to the same period in 2017 (July – November).
Global exports of whiskey had been growing 28%, but went from $595 million in the first half of the year to $526 million – a decline of 8.2% in the months after the retaliatory tariffs came into effect.
“For the first time, data can demonstrate the negative impact of retaliatory tariffs on what had been a booming export growth story,” council senior vice president for international affairs Christine LoCascio said.
Distilled Spirits Council president and CEO Chris Swonger “strongly encouraged” both the administration and trading partners in the EU, Canada and Mexico to quickly resolve the problem.
“[These] harmful tariffs… are undercutting economic growth in this sector and adversely affecting American workers,” he added.
According to market data site Statista the US’s top four whiskey export markets are France, the UK, Spain and Canada.
Domestic growth
However, sales on the domestic market proved more robust, with overall spirit sales up 5.1% to around $27.5 billion, on volumes also up 2.2% to 231 million cases – a gain of 5 million cases from last year.
The biggest growth was in super-premium rum and gin, up 28% and 15% respectively, albeit of a small base, followed by Cognac, up 14.2% to $1.8 billion, and Irish Whiskey, up 12% to $1 billion. Scotch sales also rose 9.9% to $843 million.
Tequila added around $224million of sales, an increase of 10.2% to around $3 billion total sales, while American whiskey also saw a 6.6% boost to around $3.6 billion.
Vodka, which represents a third of all spirit sales, had a “solid” year, it said, up 1.6% by volume or 2.9% by value to $6.4 billion.
Spirits continued to gain market share at the expense of beer and wine, up 37.4% of the total booze market, a gain of 0.7 percentage points.
millennials who increasingly demanded “diverse and authentic experiences”, and “innovative and higher-end products.”
“Growth was concentrated in the higher priced categories, allowing the industry to enjoy significant revenue growth while also picking up drinking occasions from other beverages,” Council chief economist David Ozgo said.
“The continued excitement surrounding super premium American whiskeys is creating a halo effect for the entire whiskey category.”
Swonger added that much of the growth in spirits was being driven by millennials who increasingly demanded “diverse and authentic experiences”, and “innovative and higher-end products.”

Stellenbosch estate Tokara has announced the release of a new flagship red wine that is the “culmination” of almost two decades of work and costs over £200 a bottle.
The new top blend from the estate is called ‘Telos’ and the first vintage to be released is the 2015.
A blend of 92% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Malbec and 3% Merlot, all the grapes are hand harvested block by block in a carefully managed series of phases. There is rigorous sorting and a mix of whole and crushed berries are then fermented with indigenous yeasts, basket pressed and then only free run juice is collected and matured in barrel for 22 months prior to bottling.
Before the arrival of Telos, Tokara’s red wines had covered two single site expressions and a Bordeaux-style blend as its flagship.
Tokara’s general manager, Karl Lambour, said: “In 2000, owner GT Ferreira’s brief to the young wine team at Tokara was ‘make a world class wine’. So in essence the vision for Telos was born out of those exact sentiments expressed almost 20 years ago.
“Finally, after many years of trialling individual parcels, various fermentation techniques and maturation regimes we found what we believe to be the magic formula – the parameters necessary to craft the most expressive wine from the Tokara site.”
Just 1,000 bottles have been produced and the estate has “unashamedly” positioned the wine in the luxury category not just with its packaging (the labels are printed on an old Heidelberg Letterpress machine) but also with an asking price of R4,200 a bottle (£232).
The wine has already received some very positive scores and remarks from leading international critics such as Tim Atkin MW and Neal Martin.
Atkin, referencing the ambitious price in his recent South Africa Report, argued that Telos is, “definitely a world class wine” and that, “the Cape belongs at the world’s top table, not just in its bargain basement.”
Lambour added: “Telos is made to honour the Ferreira family’s investment and persistence in the pursuit of excellence in the South African wine industry.”
db view: The price of ‘Telos’ is certainly ambitious at a time when South African wines in general remain very much undervalued. There will always be those who roll their eyes at new wines that are introduced at high prices. Most top wine labels in the market today commanding these prices are there on the back of a track record many decades, even centuries long.
On the other hand, Telos has an extremely limited production, Tokara is a very widely admired and respected estate with an excellent track record that has put a lot of apparent effort and care into its new top cuvée.
The quality of South African winemaking is shooting upwards currently and riding a wave of widespread critical approval. Two hundred pounds for a bottle of South African wine seems like a lot but Telos is aimed at a certain echelon of the fine wine market where that price is perfectly normal, quite low even in relative terms.
The industry in the Cape is battling problems of profitability and creating value through its production chain. If there are opportunities to be ambitious with regards pricing, to make a buzz, then it is right for Tokara or any other estate to take them. Not every wine or winery in South could or should of course but unless leading estates start asking for serious prices for their top wines and positioning them alongside other leading fine wine labels from around the world, then the people who form the key market for those sorts of wines will continue to overlook those from South Africa.
Sometimes if you don’t ask, you don’t get.

Tom Kerridge’s new restaurant at London’s Corinthia Hotel boasts a budding, searching, flavour-forward list keenly exploring both England and Germany.
Before celebrity chef, Tom Kerridge became teetotal some five years ago, his “very versatile” palate saw he was “driven to try new wines from any origin,” says sharp-suited head sommelier, Charles Beaini, who has followed that philosophy on his 700 bin strong list.
Beaini, who studied maths and physics, was Thierry Tomasin’s protégé at Angelus, later moving to Kerridge’s two Michelin-starred Marlow pub with bedrooms and hot tubs, The Hand & Flowers. At Kerridge’s large London outpost in the former Massimo’s, characterised by two bronzes from Kerridge’s sculptor wife, Beth Cullen-Kerridge, arguably invasive pounding music, and paw print branding taken from the chef’s old dog, Georgie, wines must offer “quality, express their origin, and complement the current menu.”
There is a particular emphasis on homegrown produce, including an abundance of fizz, Welsh red, and a Surrey sown noble harvest sweetie – which could work well with a signature soufflé of banana with gingerbread ice cream and spiced rum sauce. “We are keen to grow this even further,” says Beaini, adding, “there is still a lot to explore and we are really excited by English sparkling and still wines.”
Compared to The Hand & Flowers, the wine list at Kerridge’s Bar & Grill is much larger, “reaching as many places in the world as possible.” Perhaps in honour of the origin of the charismatic, media friendly manager of The Corinthia Hotel, Thomas Kochs, there are no fewer than 30 from Germany. ‘But both lists share the principle of being terroir-led.’
Beaini gives the example of baked Mont d’Or cheese with 2010 Vin Jaune (Chateau Chalon, Jean Louis Tissot) as a particularly marvellous match, with his words describing both culinary match and working relationship betwixt Kerridge and Beaini. “A simple yet very rewarding combination.”

Australian Vintage has invested $11 million in a new state-of-the-art bottling facility in Victoria in order to “significantly increase” its production capabilities.
The new facility was officially opened this week on 12 February and has been described by Australian Vintage as “one of the most technologically advanced packaging facilities in the world”.
The project is part of a larger $19 million investment to improve the company’s operations across all its sites.
Thanks to the new packaging plant, Australian Vintage will be able to bottle both its still and sparkling wines for its three key brands – McGuigan, Tempus Two and Nepenthe – under one roof. This will enable the company to bring new products to market faster and respond to what it says is “growing demand” for its sparkling wine.
The Merbein-based facility will be able to package still and sparkling wine at rates of 11,000 and 7,000 bottles per hour respectively.
Australian Vintage has also installed one of the largest privately-owned solar plants at its winery at Buronga Hill and has committed to new vineyard plantings covering over 180 hectares. In November last year, it signed what it described as a “landmark” renewable energy deal, rendering it the first wine producer in Australia to run 90% of its operations on solar and wind power. 
Australian Vintage chief executive officer, Neil McGuigan, said: “The opening of our new Merbein packaging facility is a landmark moment for Australian Vintage and represents a step-change in our capabilities as Australia’s fifth largest wine company. The $11 million investment we have made means we now have one of the most technologically advanced packaging sites in the world.
“We embarked on a meticulous two-year search for the best possible machinery available, which took us right across the globe. As a result, I am confident this investment will take our already outstanding quality reputation to the next level. It will also allow us to create new and exciting products for both domestic and global markets.”

Four of Australia’s most prominent female winemakers have joined forced to create a Shiraz label helping to promote other women in the industry.

hear me roar — a wine made from Shiraz grapes harvested in Southern Australian regions Eden Valley, Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale & Coonawarra — is the fruit of a collaboration between Sue Hodder of Wynns Coonawarra Estate, Emma Norbiato from Calabria Family Wines, Irvine Wines’ Rebekah Richardson, and Corrina Wright of Oliver’s Taranga. Proceeds from its sale will go towards scholarships and mentoring programs and professional development for women in the Australian wine industry. Hopeful candidates will be able to register for the courses in June this year.
The wine, which is spearheaded by the Australian Women in Wine Awards, (AWIWA) will be released on Thursday 21 February. Orders, which are being managed through Irvine Wines’ online shop, will be limited to six bottles per purchase.
“Hear me roar” is a reference to the song I am Woman by Australian singer Helen Reddy, which was released in 1971.
“This is an exciting next stage in the way we are able to support Australian women in wine,” Jane Thomson, founder and chair of the AWIWA, said.
“While the awards continue to provide an important platform to champion the success of women, we also recognise that more action is needed to retain women in all roles of the industry at greater levels.
“Releasing this wine is a means of generating the funding we need to make that happen.”

Barely a month after Robert Foye’s abrupt departure, Australian wine giant Treasury Wine Estates has seen another important personnel change, with the managing director of Asia and Global Travel Retail Peter Dixon, the key figure in driving the company’s China growth, also departing the company to join its rival Australian wine group, Accolade Wines.
The news was first announced by Dixon himself through his personal WeChat account, writing: “Many people have already heard that I will be leaving TWE shortly. I just want to personally thank all the amazing partners I’ve worked with over the past 10 years in Asia and specifically all the support from the China partners in the last five years.”
“Although I am going to a significantly smaller wine company with a lot less $ (Accolade Wines) from Australia, I am excited by the opportunities to be in a humble new business with amazing quality wines which I hope everyone has the opportunity to try shortly! Also a huge thanks to my amazing team at TWE for all they have done and I wish everyone good fortune for the future,” he continued.
Dixon first joined TWE in 2008 and worked his way up to become managing director for Asia, Middle East, Africa & Global Travel Retail.
His departure came shortly after Treasury Wine Estates announced strong growth in organic net sales in the 2019 interim report, and a month after Robert Foye, former COO of TWE, abruptly left his post following an unspecified breach of company policy.
In a statement sent to dbHK today, TWE confirmed the departure, and thanked Dixon’s contribution for TWE’s growth in Asia.
Tom King, who was the chief operating officer in Asia, has now been prompted to be managing director for North Asia, the company said, and will report directly to the newly appointed COO Tim Ford.
Asia remains the most lucrative market for TWE. In the 2019 interim results for the six months ended by the end of last year, the region reported a 31% EBITS growth to AU$153.1 million and an EBITS margin of 38.9%.
Accolade wines was purchased by investment group Carlyle in 2018 for about AU$1 billion, and owns popular brands such as Hardys, St Hallet, and Houghton.

Bob Lindquist is to leave California estate Qupé on 1 March and begin a new winemaking venture it has been announced.
The news broke last week that Lindquist and his wife would be setting up a new company called Lindquist Family Wines.
Qupé, the winery he founded in 1982, was bought towards the end of last year by a group called Vintage Wine Estates, who bought it from a group called Terroir Life that was previously owned by Charles Banks, the disgraced and now jailed former owner of Screaming Eagle.
At the time it was said that Lindquist would stay on at the winery in a “consulting role” but the arrangement has clearly run its course.
The Qupé wines will be produced at another winery in the Central Coast area owned by VWE.
This means that Lindquist will remain in the winery he has shared for the past 30 years with Jim Clendenen of Au Bon Climat.
In addition, his wife, Louisa Sawyer Lindquist’s, wine ‘Verdad’ will continue to be produced by the couple and the new range of wines will feature Rhône varieties and Chardonnay just as Qupé did.

The Union of French Sommeliers has hired a team of psychologists, drama teachers and sports coaches to help French sommelier David Biraud win the World’s Best Sommelier competition for the first time in 19 years.
Head sommelier at the Mandarin Oriental in Paris, Biraud will represent France for the third time in the final of the Best Sommelier in the World competition in Antwerp.
On 15 March, Biraud will compete in Antwerp on behalf of France at the ASI World’s Best Sommelier Competition, in the hopes of taking home the title for the first time in nearly two decades.
In 2010, French-born Gerard Basset, who died last month, won the world’s best title, but he had been representing the UK.
The competition takes place every three years in one of the ASI member countries, and sees sommeliers from all over the world compete in front of a live audience on all aspects of blind tasting, service and wine knowledge, as well as spirits.
Head sommelier at the Mandarin Oriental in Paris, Biraud qualified to represent France for the third time in the final of the 2019 competition in February 2018. 
In 2016, Biraud finished in the top three, alongside fellow runner-up Julie Dupouy of Ireland and winner Jon Arvid Rosengren of Sweden.
This year, the French Union of Sommeliers is upping their efforts to help Biraud, by hiring a team to help coach him through the final, as reported by The Times.
Psychologists are helping him to control his stress levels and drama teachers are being brought in to improve his performance, revealed Philippe Faure-Brac, chairman of the sommeliers’ union, who himself won the world title in 1992.
“The prize has escaped us for 19 years and so we really want to prepare David Biraud for the competition,” he said.
Faure-Brac also complimented the Scandinavians on their approach to the competition, who he said the French had become fearsome competition, with the absence of a winemaking tradition working to their advantage.
Whereas French wine-waiters were brought up on French wine, their Swedish counterparts acquired global knowledge, he told the paper.
“What was once a handicap has become an asset,” he said. “We southern Europeans tend to talk about wine in more emotional terms, whereas international juries tend to want a more technical language. In France, we might say that a wine is the colour of a sunset. But the Anglo-Saxons will define it as light, medium or dark.”
Other sommeliers competing include Julie Dupuoy for Ireland, Eric Zwiebel for the UK, Fredrik Lindfors of Sweden and Nina Højgaard Jensen of Denmark.

Pubs, bars restaurants and retailers in the London borough of Southwark may be charged to serve booze after midnight from September if the council goes through with plans to impose a late night levy across the borough.
The Shard building at London Bridge
The council is launching a 12-week consultation next week into the levy, which would affect 439 businesses including 125 restaurants, 122 wine bars, and 73 supermarkets and shops in the South East of London, from London Bridge, to Dulwich, Rotherhide to Peckham and Camberwell.
Businesses would be charged between £299 and £4,440 a year for the license, depending on their current rateable value, however around 40 small businesses would be able to apply for a 30% reduction in the levy, as well as 140 businesses operating in the three Business Improvement District (BID) and two other best practise schemes.
The move would raise between £365,000 – £420,00 a year, which the council want to use to tackle booze-related crime and anti-social behaviour across the borough and provide a safer late night environment. Usually the levy is split between the council and the Police, but Southwark Council wants to retain the majority.
According to local news site London SE1, the area’s key crime hotspots include Borough High Street, London Bridge, and Elephant and Castle.
The council will vote on the decision in July, and if it is approved, charges will be introduced on 1 September.
Five other London boroughs have already rolled late night levies – the City of London, Camden, Islington, Hackney and Tower Hamlets – and the London borough of Redbridge also launched a consultation this month, which would affect businesses in Romford, Ilford and Chelmsford.
A further seven borough outside London also have levies, including, Chelmsford, Liverpool, Newcastle, Nottingham and Southampton.
However a recent report on London’s night time economy by the chair of the London Night Time Commission, Kate Nicholls argued that local partnerships, particularly BIDs were a better way of managing town centres at night than introducing the levy.
“Such partnerships have been far better at bringing long-term benefits than imposing, for example, the Late Night Levy. We believe the levy should only ever be a last resort. Partnership should be the priority,” the report said.
“If the Late Night Levy or similar tax is considered, funds raised should be used to promote and support affected centres at night.”

In a chat with dbHK, the seasoned winemaker talks about the wine and music of his birth vintage, a 1990 Groth Reserve from Napa Valley that transformed his understanding about wine, as well as the problem with the industry’s excessive intellectualism.
What vintage are you? 
Funny thing is I don’t know too much about my birth year in terms of wine quality, how those wines were received and how they held up. I have had a 1964 Vega Sicilia that was one of the most memorable wines of my life. What I can tell you it was an incredible year for music with the Beatles owning the top 100, the Stones releasing their first album and one of the all-time great songs, ‘House of the Rising Sun’ making its debut. Wine and music go hand in hand, and if music is the indicator I hope wine was there as well.
What bottle sparked your love of wine? 
The wine that transformed my understanding of what wine could be and where it might take me was the 1990 Groth Reserve from Napa Valley. I was a bartender in Chicago out with a few bartending colleagues at a small Italian restaurant in Little Italy on the near west side. When there we typically drank a Chianti in the basket bottle. Our server was a friend who understood wine much better than any of us did at the time and he insisted on sharing this bottle with us that he had brought in knowing we were coming in that night. It changed my life. 
What would you be as a wine? 
I make the wine I would be, Cabernet Sauvignon.     
Where are you happiest? 
I find happiness in so many places, the vineyards that I work with, the ocean and the bay that I’ve sailed on, live music venues, my kitchen or deep in a book but nothing holds any water to the days I have spent watching my daughters perform music or playing soccer on a Saturday afternoon. Seeing them grow up and excel at their endeavours, through thick and thin, is the best thing ever.
What’s your greatest vice? 
What is my greatest vice? Wow it’s getting real personal now. I don’t have any one particular vice that consumes me. I like to spread myself equally across a wide range of bad behaviours.
Best advice you ever received? 
I worked for a woman many years ago who managed a large team of people and had a tremendous responsibility to perform at the highest level in the medical industry. She always did her work with a steady attitude, an astute understanding of the process and in a methodical way. Issues would arise, crisis would flare, people would go psycho, and a host of other challenges would come and go and throughout she remained steadfast. She was very successful with most of the blips in normalcy just rolling off her back. 
The key to her success was a piece of advice she gave me very early on in her management of me: “Control the controllables.” In other words try to understand those things that you can manoeuvre, change or direct. Have as much of that lined up as possible. There will be challenges you cannot control, i.e. weather, a change in guard, new competitive products, political upheaval, market forces beyond your control, the list goes on and on. The key is to realise you do not have control of those things and to not stress over them, and to have as much as you are able to control prepared to confront them. The not stressing them over part is really useful in the wine business where some people in our industry stress over the weather. There is no changing the weather so why stress over it. Just be ready to pivot if it goes awry.
Your cellar’s underwater, which bottle would you dive in and save? 
The 2001 Cardinale. It was the first Cardinale I blended and I think one of the best wines I have made. It has the highest percentage of Merlot I have ever used in the blend at 27% and to this day still drinks incredibly well.
What’s the best and worst thing about the wine business? 
The best thing about the wine business is that we make this incredibly alluring beverage in some of the most beautiful places on the planet, it creates memory, history, emotion, and it lives and it dies like us. 
The worst thing is that we sometimes make it hard to allow people to feel comfortable just drinking wine for the pure enjoyment of it rather than the celebration some have for the esoteric intellectualism that comes with the accumulation of wine knowledge. I fear and sometimes see how this makes many people shy away because of the awkwardness of feeling called out on your level of knowledge.
What’s on your wine bucket list? 
Not so much wine is on my bucket list as it is visiting vineyard areas. I haven’t yet visited Porto, Ribero del Duero, the Rheingau, Alsace or Sardinia.
Who would you invite to your dream dinner party? 
The Rolling Stones, Beethoven, Mozart, Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, JRR Tolkien, The inaugural cast of Saturday Night Live, Mark Twain, Jack Kerouac, Michelangelo and Einstein. Could make for an interesting evening. We would certainly need a lot of wine.
Personal satisfaction (Parker points – out of 100)?
I will say is that I am always striving to achieve that level of excellence in whatever I do. I may not reach it but in my heart I know that I have done everything humanly possible to allow for that level of recognition.
Which wine would you like served at your funeral?
I want my funeral to be a celebration. So bring on the 1990 Dom Perignon Oenotheque!

While dogs have long been used by truffle hunters for their keen sense of smell, a Chilean cooperage has trained five clever pups to detect TCA in wine barrels.
Five dogs have been trained by TN Coopers in Chile to sniff out TCA at its facility
As reported by Wine Spectator, five dogs – Ambrosia, Odysé, Moro, Mamba and Zamba – have been trained by TN Coopers in the Chilen town of Curacaví to sniff out TCA, TBA and other harmful compounds that make wine undrinkable.
Dubbed the Natinga Project, meaning “search of origin” in Zulu, the idea was inspired by sniffer dogs at airports.
Paw patrol: one of the four-legged stave sniffers hard at work
But rather than drugs, the hounds are trained to seek out the compounds that lead to those distinctive TCA aromas of damp cardboard and musty cellars.
“Dogs have a much wider olfactory threshold than humans, and thus can detect very small concentrations of specific compounds through their sense of smell,” Guillermo Calderón, TN Coopers’ marketing manager, told WS.
“Their sense of smell is extremely reliable and rarely misses,” he added.
While corks get all the bad press, other steps in the winemaking process, including barreling, are vulnerable to contamination from airborne chemicals.
Wine Spectator reports that the quintet can also work their magic at wineries. One of the dogs recently pinpointed the source of TCA at a winery on a small rubber ring attached to an old hose.
TN Coopers is planning to offer its sniffer dog services to wineries in California and other wine regions in the US.

UK wine distributor Ellis Wines will have amassed two months’ worth of extra stock by next month in order to counteract potential logistical issues caused by Brexit.
Speaking to the drinks business at the distributor’s portfolio tasting at the Vintners’ Hall in London this month, Rupert Lovie, head of marketing at Ellis, revealed the company’s plans to ensure a smoother transition as the Brexit deadline approaches.
Ellis is one of many drinks companies, including Pernod Ricard, Diageo, The Wine Society, Majestic Wines and MMD, that have confirmed that they are stockpiling in the run-up to the 29 March.
“We’ve taken on board more stock to make sure we have sufficient volumes of our key lines,” said Lovie. “I can confirm that by March, we will have an extra two months of stock in our warehouse.
“This was initially focused on our top 50 volume products but has now been extended to our entire core portfolio. We are moving our dry goods out of the warehouse into containers outside in order to accommodate the stock and keep it in the best condition.
“Our new prices will come into effect in the second week of March. While the duty increase is manageable, it’s the potential logistical issues that are our main concern.
“What we can’t control is the changing exchange rates and a logistical backlog at the ports.”
Vegan wines
At this year’s tasting, as well as tables manned by its suppliers, Ellis opted for a number of themed tables, showcasing organic, biodynamic and vegan wines.
Lovie told db that while a lot of Ellis’ suppliers are already producing vegan wines, there has been a more concerted effort to highlight this in recent months.
“A lot of our wines are vegan but the producers haven’t been actively publicising it,” he said. “More recently, we’ve seen a greater demand from our customers for vegan wines and our suppliers are starting to be more proactive about labelling their wines as such.”
Ellis’ suppliers who are now promoting their vegan credentials include: Backsberg (South Africa); Brookfields Vineyards (New Zealand); Viña La Playa and Chono (Chile) and Finca Sophenia (Argentina). He added that one of Ellis’ German suppliers, Dr. Bürklin-Wolf, has also been certified by the Lacon Institute as vegan-friendly.
In the wake of rising demand, Lovie added that he feels that regulations and definitions of vegan wines need to be tightened so that consumers are clear about what they’re drinking.
“When someone says that a wine is vegan, most people immediately think about processing and the use of vegan fining agents,” he said.
“Consumers often don’t understand that if a wine is organic, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s vegan-friendly too. 
“There needs to be discussions about what we should communicate to our customers, starting with a proper definition.”
According to Jancis Robinson’s Oxford Companion to Wine, “the main area of concern is the use of animal-based products for fining and stabilising wine”. The entry goes on to list the agents (bentonite) which are suitable for vegans, and others, which despite being animal-derived, may be acceptable to vegetarians, such as casein and albumin.
Lovie added: “Strictly speaking wines produced using biodynamic methods are not vegan as the producers carry out practices such as burying cow horns in the vineyard.”
That said, Ellis Wines is also actively looking to boost its organic and biodynamic wine listings.
“When buyers are deciding on a wine and it’s down to a 50:50 call between one wine and another, the fact that one of them is biodynamic will definitely count in its favour,” said Lovie.
Event diary
As well as overhauling its website and developing a new search function, Ellis has also created a new ‘event diary’ to encourage its customers to change their wine offerings more frequently. 
“We’ve developed a new diary to see if we can inspire our customers to sell more interesting wines,” said Lovie.
“It allows them to change-up their wine offerings according to key dates in the calendar. We’ve tried to keep it fairly generic rather than listing specific wines in order to give our customers more options. We didn’t want to put anyone off but instead inspire dialogue and encourage people to put on special events throughout the year.”
Created in collaboration with the team’s graphic designer, Maria Blackstone, the calendar identifies a number of key dates and food items that are in season each month, and suggests wine styles that would pair well with them.

ProWein has appointed a new director of the fair in Düsseldorf – who also assumes the role of ‘global head for wine and spirits’ – it has been announced this morning.
Effective April 1 this year, Bastian Mingers will be the new global head for wine and spirits and director of ProWein at Messe Düsseldorf in Germany
The news follows the decision by the fair organiser, Messe Düsseldorf, to promote the current ProWein director Marius Berlemann to the position of general manager of Messe Düsseldorf Shanghai Co. Ltd., with project and HR responsibility for the entire Messe Düsseldorf portfolio in China.
With Berlemann moving to Shanghia in April, the company has had to find a new global head for wine and spirits and director of the fair in Düsseldorf, and they have promoted someone from within the company – Bastian Mingers, who has worked for Messe Düsseldorf since February 2011.
Mingers will officially take up the role on 1 April, ensuring that Berlemann will oversee this year’s ProWein, which runs from 17 to 19 March, and marks the 25th edition of the fair.
Berlemann will then move to Shanghai in April, where he will take charge of all the group’s exhibitions in Asia, including ProWine China and ProWine Asia (Hong Kong).
Meanwhile, Mingers, who is 35 years-old, will continue to work towards improving the fair in Düsseldorf, particularly a project of redevelopment that will see a new hall layout for ProWein by 2021.
Speaking exclusively to the drinks business last week, Mingers stressed that the transition from Berlemann to himself would be smooth because he already had extensive experience of the ProWein fair, even though his most recent role at Messe Düsseldorf saw him manage an exhibition called Energy Storage, which is an international conference and trade fair for renewable energies.
“In my previous role from 2011 to 2015 as senior project manager for ProWein, I worked on five shows, before taking the lead for a new trade fair for energy storage, so I am familiar with the wine and spirits industry,” he said.
He added that he has a background in hospitality, having started his career in hotel management, ensuring he has an understanding of the on-premise.
“I know the topic, and I have a background in gastronomy and the hotel business, so this industry is close to my heart,” he explained.
In terms of any changes he is planning for the German-based fair, he assured db that it would be business as usual, and that he would continue a project of improvement put in place by Berlemann.
“Marius has been a great project director for ProWein, so it is very well set up, and I will continue to work on a new hall layout, and I will continue to work on visitor growth, along with service quality and capacity, because these are things where we can do more to make ProWein still the number one fair for wine in the world,” he said.
When asked about his intentions to improve “service quality and capacity”, Mingers said that he was looking at measures to ease the pressure on “gastronomy and other facilities”, including public transportation, to make the visitor experience better considering the huge number of people attracted to the exhibition each year.
He also mentioned the positive impact of using “hotel ships”, which are moored on the River Rhine, right alongside the fairground, to provide accommodation for visitors that is both convenient, and relatively inexpensive compared to the major hotels in central Düsseldorf.
Regarding a redesigned hall layout, he told db that ProWein would soon benefit from a rebuilt Hall 1 (pictured below), which would make it easier for visitors to come and go from the fair, while allowing more space for stand-holders.

London-based restaurant group D&D is set to offer a group-wide, two-week long initiative, encouraging young adults to join the hospitality industry.
The group’s My Hospitality World will involve a series of open-door events across their restaurants with a focus on making hospitality an attractive career path.
The D&D restaurant group, founded in 2006 by Des Gunewardena and David Loewi, includes London restaurants Le Pont de la Tour, Bluebird and Coq d’Argent and also has venues in Paris, New York and Tokyo.
London Chairman and CEO Des Gunewardena said that “it’s crucial to our future that we have plenty of young talent eager to come into hospitality. Working in restaurants is viewed by many people as not being an occupation to aspire to and we want to change that.”
Activities as part of the schedule will feature an Apprenticeship Taster evening and training including a Flambé Masterclass.  An event on International Women’s Day (8 March) led by Kim Woodward, the first female head chef in the 126-year history of the Savoy Grill, will focus on increasing the number of female chefs in the industry.
A full restaurant takeover of D&D London’s Blueprint Café by London South East College will offer pupils the opportunity to work alongside head chef Joseph Albina to devise, cook and serve a ticketed three-course lunch to the public.
The initiative follows the group’s work over the last three years in collaboration with charity Inspire which has seen two-hundred Year 10 and Year 12 students undertake a two-week tailored work experience in their kitchens.
My Hospitality World will launch on 25 February.

Victor Lugger and Tigrane Seydoux are the restauranteurs behind the Big Mamma group which includes La Felicitá, Pink Mamma, and six other businesses in Paris. Gloria is set to be followed by a second London-based restaurant on Fitzrovia’s Rathbone Square.
Gloria’s menu will feature cacio e pepe pasta inside a wheel of cheese, a 10-layer lasagne, lobster risotto and a lemon meringue pie with an over-all theme of decadently sized dishes designed for sharing.
Rumoured to be a tribute to chef de cuisine Alberto Suardi, the ‘Youporn’ pizza will consist of smoked mozzarella, parmesan cream, broccoli, fennel salami and olives. The wine list will start at £23 for the house Trebbiano or Sangiovese, and include a carefully chosen selection of Barolos.
Pasta, coffee, ice cream, limoncello and beer will be produced in-house.
Lugger and Seydoux said “We do that because that’s how they do it in Italy. Plus it’s way more fun and ensures we have kick-ass quality and 100 percent traceability. Our entire team is young, gutsy, passionate and Italian, and to us – that’s what matters most.”
Located on the corner of Great Eastern Street and Charlotte Street on the former site of Red’s True Barbecue, Gloria will seat 160 people over two floors. The ground floor promises to be a homage to the glamour of Capri in the 1950s to 1970s with ornate pink and gold decor. The basement, licensed until 2am Thursday to Saturday, will feature velour banquettes and a mirrored ceiling.
Gloria will open on 22 February.

"High quality Sauvignon Blanc is as ageworthy as Pinot Noir, and shares a similar evolutionary trajectory, according to one leading winemaker in Marlborough."," 18th February, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/02/sauvignon-blanc-is-as-ageworthy-as-pinot-noir/,"18th February, 2019

High quality Sauvignon Blanc is as ageworthy as Pinot Noir, and shares a similar evolutionary trajectory, according to one leading winemaker in Marlborough.
Sauvignon Blanc is as ageworthy as Pinot Noir according to Simon Barker of Barker’s Marque Wines
Speaking to db during the 2019 International Sauvignon Blanc Celebration in Marlborough last month, Simon Barker of Barker’s Marque Wines in the Awatere Valley, said:
“We don’t talk enough about older Sauvignon and the ageability of the variety. I think it has the same peaks and troughs as Pinot Noir in the ageing process, but no one considers it. The wines evolve well if they’re good wines to start with.
“It’s great to see that winemakers are going down more of a textural and structural route with Sauvignon Blanc in order to make food friendly wines that can age.
Oak aged wines like Cloudy Bay’s Te Koko are showing another side to Sauvignon
“These wines can be a hard sell though, as they’re too funky for some and not funky enough for others.” Barker said his own winemaking style has evolved over the years to a less is more approach.
“When I was a young winemaker it was all about bells and whistles and adding things to my wines, but I’ve learnt that less is more and it’s all about the fruit. I work with oak to add an extra layer of complexity, but I’ve never gone out of my way to make edgy wines,” he said.
Brian Bicknell, chief winemaker at Mahi Wines, shares Barker’s view that New Zealand’s best Sauvignons are built to last. “I think the barrel fermented riper styles of Sauvignon can age for up to 20 years. The key now is for producers to show its quality, complexity, depth and ageability.
“Winemakers need to tell their stories and we need to get these ageworthy expressions onto the market. When a variety like Sauvignon Blanc becomes successful people have their blinkers on and think that it will all taste the same.
“Sommeliers have preconceived ideas about Sauvignon Blanc and they don’t want to take on a wine that will dominate their list. Our job is to keep their minds open so they don’t write it off.”
As for the broader picture in NZ, Bicknell believes it’s time for the industry to sharpen its focus.
“It’s healthy to ask where we’re going as an industry, as a lot the Sauvignon Blanc currently produced is pretty simple and sold at lower price points, which has led to the loss of a number of smaller labels over the years.
“We need a sharper focus when it comes to Sauvignon Blanc and should only be making wine from our best vineyard sites.
“Consumers start caring about sub-regionality at £10 and over as that’s when you start getting more character out of the wines, but I think there’s room for both the blending model and the single vineyard model in Marlborough,” he told db. One challenge when it comes to diversity within New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is the fact that the majority of winemakers work with the same UCD1 clone.
“A wider use of clones and experimentation with different rootstocks could be good for the industry in order to have a broader variety of styles.”

With the rise in consumer demand for low and no alcohol drinks, beer giant AB InBev is converting wasted alcohol from its low and no-ABV beers into biofuel, combining two major trends in the drinks industry.

As demand for low alcohol drinks, beer in particular, has risen over the past 12 months, AB InBev’s European headquarters has struck a deal with a biofuel plant in Belgium in order to convert leftover alcohol from the brewing process into fuel.
Each week the brewer transports 75,000 litres of alcohol from the creation of its range of no ABV beers including Leffe Blond 0.0%, Hoegaarden 0.0% and Jupiler 0.0% – enough to fill three tanker trucks – from its European headquarters in Leuven to Alcogroup, a Belgian biofuel producer and one of the largest plants of its kind on the continent.
Alcohol from 85 cans of beer is enough to generate 1 litre of biofuel, according to the brewer. For every 100 litre of residual alcohol, this generates 18 litre of biofuel.
In the last 12 months there has been a surge in the production of and demand for lighter beers with lower levels of alcohol.
Moving annual total of low and no-ABV products has risen by 24.4% in volume and by 29.6% in value in two years – by 22.7% and 24.3 % respectively in the past year, according to CGA.
Alcohol has a lower boiling rate than water. Most mainstream low ABV beers are made by brewing the serve as normal, before it is heated up to that point and kept there until the solution is only 0.5 percent ABV. Before the boom in alcohol-free drinks, the alcohol was simply thought of as wastage, but with an increased production volume, brewers are looking for ways to make their process more efficient.
“We want to reuse as much as we can in the circular economy,” David De Schutter, Research and Development Director for AB InBev in Europe, said.
There are a number of challenges involved in making the residual alcohol “interesting for Alcogroup” Yleni De Neve, AB InBev’s European environment manager, said. “We had to work on stabilising the process.”

Industry body New Zealand Winegrowers has teamed up with podcast creator Lawrence Francis of Interpreting Wine in order to provide in-depth coverage of its annual tasting.
The podcast series will take the form of seven episodes, featuring interviews with four winemakers and three regional masterclasses.
The first episode will be unveiled today (18 February) with all seven due to be released by 24 February.
The podcasts are available free of charge on major platforms including Spotify and iTunes. They will also be made available on the New Zealand Winegrowers website at a later date.
The episode schedule is as follows: episode one, Jamie Marfell, group winemaker at Pernod Ricard; episode two, Warren Gibson, winemaker at Trinity Hill; episode three, Sam Bennett, winemaker at Te Pa Wines; episode four, Kevin Judd, winemaker and owner at Greywacke; episode five, Rebecca Gibb MW, a masterclass on Central Otago, episode six, Ronan Sayburn MS and Kevin Judd, a masterclass on Marlborough; and episode seven, Rebecca Gibb MW, a masterclass on Hawke’s Bay
Europe marketing manager at New Zealand Winegrowers, Chris Stroud, commented: “We were delighted when Lawrence approached us to cover our annual tasting on his podcast. This series allows people who were not able to attend our tasting the opportunity to hear directly from the winemakers and learn from the regional masterclasses. We hope it brings a flavour of New Zealand to them.”
Lawrence Francis, content director at Interpreting Wine added: “Podcasting is a versatile and effective tool for wine communication. I know farmers who listen to the show on their tractors and others who play it while driving or working off their wine calories in the gym. In September 2018 Ofcom found that half of UK podcast listeners are under 35 so I think it’s an excellent way to connect with young wine drinkers.”
New Zealand Winegrowers’ annual London tasting took place on 16 January this year. You can listen to the podcast series here.

The Wine Society is trialling a series of new one-minute videos promoting its co-operative approach to sourcing wine in order to remain “relevant” to tech-savvy consumers of the Youtube generation.
The new one-minute ‘Insatiably Curious’ videos, which were made in collaboration with local film company Standout Films, marks a change in direction for the Stevenage-based wine mutual, which is owned by its members.
The short clips are designed to tell the story of the co-operative and its approach to wine sourcing as well as celebrating its long-standing relationships with its suppliers.
“We’re unique and that message needs to come across in all that we do.” The Wine Society’s Ewan Murray told the drinks business.
“We are keen to experiment in how we get our message across.”
The Society currently has around 140,000 current active members and said it wanted to ensure it remains relevant to them as well as appealing to a wider audience.
Murray said there were plans in the pipeline for further videos focusing on its co-operative business model, and would feature spirits and beers as well as wine producers, but initially it was a trial to test the appetite for such media among the Society’s target market.
“We want these to appeal to potential members within the discerning wine drinker universe, bringing a newer and fresher approach to our co-operative story and spreading the joy of good wine, which is what The Society has been about since 1874,” he said.
“Since we posted the video across all our social media channels, the views and shares also show approval from the current membership about how we do business, as well as affirmation of their choice to buy from The Society.”

Introducing its first video from Three Choirs vineyard in Gloucestershire, the Wine Society said it had championed English wine “before most”.
“2018 is widely believed to be the best vintage ever for our home grown wines, but we’ve been following their fortunes for a long time, working with the brilliant team at Gloucestershire’s Three Choirs for more than 25 years.”
Last month the Society’s head of buying Pierre Mansour told the drinks business that the number of active, engaged members had increased by around two and a half percent. The increase in membership was one of the contributing factors behind its decision to increase the size of its warehousing facilities, along with preparing for a hard Brexit.
In a previous interview, Mansour told db attracting younger, discerning drinkers had been a key focus for the business, and a key reason for rolling out a click and collect service in April 2017, in order to provide a more “instantaneous” delivery for millennial consumers.

Italian wine cafe chain Veeno, which operates 17 aperitivo-style cafes across the UK, has closed two of its sites and is conducting a review of its estate, it has been reported.
The company – which comprises 12 company-owned bars and five that are run as franchises – has already shut its Harrogate restaurant as part of the review, and is rumoured to be in talks with landlords about a number of other sites, according to local news site, Inside Media.
Last month Veeno shut its Norwich franchise after four months of trading, but is said to be keen to re-open the site as a company-owned cafe.
The review follows the departure of the bar’s co-founder and finance director Andrea Zecchino in November and the appointment of former Walt Disney media and entertainment exec Rodrigue Trouillet, as the company’s commercial director and new business partner.
Co-founder Nino Caruso reportedly said the company had grown very fast in the last few years and the management felt it was “the right time” to look at the estate.
The company launched its first Italian aperitivo-style bar in Manchester in 2013 after raising around £200,00 of equity funding through Crowdcube, which it topped up with a £150,000 loan from Funding Tree to fund refurbishments.
By 2016, it had expanded with four more bars in Leeds, York and Liverpool and Nottingham and started to look beyond its Midlands heartland, telling db it had ambitious plans to establish a national chain of around 80 stores.
It currently operates bars in Brighton, Bristol, Cardiff, Chester, Croydon, Kidderminster, Liverpool, Leicester, London, Manchester, Nottingham, Reading, Stratford-upon-Avon, and two in both Edinburgh and Leeds, and has a turnover of around £6 million.
The company sources wine from Caruso’s family vineyard in Sicily, which it serves alongside a selection of ‘spuntini’ – platters of meats, cheeses and other appetisers imported from Italian producers.

Gianfranco Soldera, owner of the famous Case Basse winery in Brunello di Montalcino has died aged 82.
The winemaker reportedly suffered a heart attack while driving on 16 February and attempts to revive him were unsuccessful.
Born in Treviso in 1937 he initially worked as an insurance broker but he founded his winery in 1972, planting all his own vineyards.
From the beginning he strove to work as naturally and traditionally as possible. He was famed for his wines and for his strong opinions. He was completely unafraid of calling out producers he felt were not doing justice to Brunello and was an outright advocate of Sangiovese.
This brought him a devoted legion of fans and a reputation as one of Brunello’s foremost winemakers but his occasionally abrasive attitude did not always go down well with others.
In 2012 a former employee broke into the winery and opened the taps on several botti, draining the equivalent of 6,000 cases of wine from the 2007 to 2012 vintages worth several million euro.
The perpetrator, Andrea Di Gisi, was caught and jailed. The consorzio rallied round and offered Gianfranco some wine from several producers for him to sell but he dismissed the offer as dishonest and soon afterwards quit the consorzio to make his wines under the Tuscan IGP classification.
Despite the fallout, Case Basse continues to be a highly sought-after label among lovers of fine Italian wine.
Soldera is survived by his wife, two children and grandchildren.

The Aberdare-based whisky producer announced plans for the site in Swansea in July 2018, and has since worked with Swansea Council and Swansea University in order to draw up a plan to redevelop the historic Hafod Morfa Copperworks site – a 19th Century former powerhouse building.
The scheme, designed by GWP Architecture, will see a distillery and new barrel store, offices and a VIP bar built across the 12-acre site, as well as a new-build visitor centre with shop, tasting bar, exhibition space and a covered walkway that will connect the refurbished powerhouse and 60 parking spaces.
The plans have already secured a grant for £3.75m from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and now also have planning permission from the council.
Penderyn owner Nigel Short said: “The plans are exciting for us as a business and for Swansea as a community with great plans for its future prosperity. Penderyn wants to be a part of the regeneration of the copperworks and repeat the success we already have with our Welsh single malt whisky and other products.”
It is hoped the move will attract more than 50,000 visitors a year, thanks to the Penderyn Experience whisky tour.
Penderyn, which also produces Brecon gin and Five vodka, announced the decision at a 20Twenty Business Growth conference in Wrexham. It also plans to open a retail outlet, additional visitor centre and training hub in Llandudno.
The producer hopes construction in Swansea will begin at end of this year with the facility slated to open by 2022.

Online auctioneer iDealwine has said that it has noticed a mounting increase in sales of natural/low intervention wines are on the rise on its platform.
A trend iDealwine first noted back in 2017, auctions in mid-January of this year saw also witnessed strong interest for various labels from Jura, the Loire, Rhône and Burgundy which are all part of the low intervention movement.
The Jura is one of the regions best-known for what are increasingly ‘cult’ French producers. Jacques Overnoy’s wines are among the most successful at auction, some of his white wines showing gains of over 50%.
Adeline Houillon & Pierre Bruyère are also high in the rankings alongside another favourite Jean-François Ganevat whose older vintages of ‘Les Vignes de mon Père’ now routinely sell for over €400 a bottle when just two years ago €150 was the norm.
The Loire is another heartland of the ‘cult French’ movement. Usually classified as Vin de France (the Loire contains perhaps some of the highest numbers of producers prepared to quit the various AOCs), producers such as Stéphane Bernaudeau and Richard Leroy are seeing “striking results” at auctions and being outside of AOCs does not seem to be denting their popularity – quite the reverse.
The white Saumur wines of Antoine Foucault, son of Charly Foucault of Clos Rougeard, are also moving well, the 2012 vintage seeing gains of 40% in recent sales.
The Rhône and parts of southern France are also good places to look. Thierry Allemand’s Cornas wines are very closely followed and the 2009 vintage of his single-parcel cuvée ‘Chaillot’ recently sold for €584.
Even established regions such as Burgundy are not immune. The Côte d’Or is home to some of the most sought-after and expensive wines in the world but oneophiles are increasingly latching on to other names such as Frédéric Cossard and Philippe Pacalet whose wines are seeing steep upward price trajectories at auction.

Kentucky’s Bourbon industry contributes US$8.6 billion annually to the state’s economy – a 60% increase since 2009 – according to a study by the Kentucky Distillers’ Association.," 19th February, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/02/kentucky-bourbon-industry-worth-8-6-billion/,"19th February, 2019

Kentucky’s Bourbon industry contributes US$8.6 billion annually to the state’s economy – a 60% increase since 2009 – according to a study by the Kentucky Distillers’ Association.
The study also indicates that the bourbon industry in Kentucky generates $235 million in local and state tax revenue and a total annual payroll topping $1 billion generating 20,100 jobs – a 104% increase since 2009 and 2,600 more since 2016.
The industry is also in the middle of a $2.3 billion building boom, with Diageo and Stoli both in the process of building multi-million pound distilleries in the state.
In the past decade, the number of distilleries in Kentucky has more than tripled to 68, and the number of counties with a distillery has quadrupled to 32.
If the industry continues to grow at this rate, the Association believes its economic output will exceed $10 billion by 2020, with employment more than 24,000 with payroll over $1.2 billion.
It follows protests 10 years ago against tax hike on spirits, with the industry then urging legislator’s to modernise “archaic” alcohol laws, reform outdated tourism restrictions and tackle the discriminatory tax that only Kentucky levies on aging whiskey barrels.
Previously, Kentucky was subject to an ad valorem barrel tax – a tax levied against ageing Bourbon barrels. That was repealed in 2014 under the House Bill 445, which offered Kentucky distillers a corporate income tax credit against the amount of barrel taxes paid, providing that money was reinvested into their work in Kentucky.
“By virtually eliminating the barrel tax, we paved the way for more than one billion dollars in new distillery investments and created jobs for thousands of Kentuckians,” said Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester. “That growth is exactly what an authentic signature industry can do for Kentucky.”
Eric Gregory, president of the Kentucky Distillers’ Association, called the turnaround a “monumental success story”.
“By working together to remove unnecessary and artificial barriers to business, we have transformed Kentucky Bourbon from an industry once viewed as ‘sin’ to one that truly defines signature impact, expansion and global image,” he said. “This is the epitome of how a public-private partnership works.”
The biennial study was conducted by economists Dr Paul Coomes and Barry Kornstein, formerly of the University of Louisville, in conjunction with the Kentucky Distillers’ Association. The study was based on data collected before retaliatory tariffs on whiskey exports were imposed by the European Union, China, Canada, Mexico and Turkey, with the impact on Kentucky distilling not measured in this report.

Henry Tang, Hong Kong’s former chief secretary and a key figure in eliminating wine tax in the city, is apparently considering planting vineyards in West Kowloon with “Instagram worthy” views over the harbour.
Henry Tang (left) at our Asian Personality Awards hosted by the drinks business and Vinexpo in 2018
Tang revealed the plan when interviewed by South China Morning Post arguing that wine is part of arts and culture, and the local climate can be suitable for planting grapes despite the capricious subtropical weather, and the city’s high labour and land cost.
A key policy figure in eradicating tariffs on wine in Hong Kong in 2008, Tang now serves as chairman of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority.
The proposed vineyard is expected to be located in West Kowloon Cultural District’s M+, a visual cultural museum near the waterfront, and the varieties suggested by Tang are Chardonnay and Merlot.
“I will provide more details in due course. I hope Hong Kong can have a vineyard with a harbour view, and this will be a very good Instagram moment,” Tang told SCMP.
The politician who is also an avid wine collector and drinker said he has already contacted vineyard owners in France for advice.
It’s unknown at this stage the scale of the proposed project. Hong Kong became a wine trading hub in Asia after the local government led by Tang eradicated all tariffs on wine in 2008. Consumption of wine remains high and the city’s drinkers are known for drinking expensive bottles of Bordeaux and Burgundy. But whether the city can transform itself from a wine consumer to a wine producer still remains to be seen.
However, making wines in countries with tropical climate is not unheard of, with successful examples in Thailand, India and Indonesia. But it comes with its own perils, with the merciless monsoon season, lack of sunlight hours due to the close proximity to the Equator and the unique ‘two seasons, one crop’ training system, meaning that grapes undergo two vegetation periods – one in the wet season (usually from April to October), and another in the dry season (November to March) – but only the dry season vegetation leads to a crop.
Making wines in Hong Kong is not a complete novelty either. A few years back, Urban Projects by The Flying Winemaker imported grapes from Australia, the US and France to produce wines at an urban winery.
Tang is known for his wine taste and collection. The former candidate for Hong Kong’s top office job auctioned off part of his rare wine collections through Christie’s for more than HK$ 48 million in 2013.
A scandal in 2012 after he was found to have illegally constructed a wine cellar at the basement of his luxury house was largely blamed for costing him the job as Hong Kong’s chief executive.

Supervised by Dr Lynda McMaster-Schuyler and Dr Peiyu Zeng, university students Sabrina Long, Zachary Taylor and Nino Gagliardi are attempting to extract strains of yeast from a bottle of beer from the SS Oregon.
The ship sank on a voyage from Liverpool to New York City in 1886, after colliding with a schooner when it was only a few hours from its final destination.
One person, out of the 852 people on board, is known to have died during the incident.
The university has partnered with Serious Brewing based in Howes Cave in New York State. Should the students successfully extract viable strains of yeast, head brewer Bill Felter will attempt to use them to brew a new beer.
Image: SUNY Cobleskill
The beer was uncorked in the presence of college president Marion A Terenzio, who joined Felter for a taste test. The beer was initially was given to Felter by a customer who owns three such bottles as well as other artefacts sourced from the wreckage.
Terenzio commented: “This is applied research at its best. Our faculty make it possible for us to do what we do, and for our students to perform research that undergraduates usually do not have an opportunity to perform.”
The biotechnology department will monitor the extraction process and will compare any extracted strains to four strains of years it has already cultivated in its labs.

Treasury Wine Estates (TWE) has reported its strongest ever growth in organic net sales, as the Australian wine giant prepares to increase its investment in its French portfolio and launch a Penfolds Champagne.
TWE’s net sales revenue increased by 13% to AU$1.507 billion during the six months to 31 December 2108
Reporting its 2019 interim results for the six months ending December 31, TWE said net sales revenue increased by 13% on a constant currency basis to AU$1.507 billion, which represents the strongest organic growth rate in company history.
Its EBITS were AU$338.3 million, up 19%, with growth delivered across all regions.
With strong growth momentum, the wine giant also revealed that it will acquire winery resources in France that will “provide access to winery production facilities, access to quality vineyards and luxury bulk wines” for its expanding French wine portfolio, which includes its Maison de Grand Esprit label, and launch a previously announced Penfolds Champagne, 
In July of last year, Penfolds winemaker Peter Gago said he expected the Champagne to be released in 2019 in time for Penfolds’ 175th anniversary.
Additionally, there are also plans to introduce Beaulieu Vineyards wines made in France, which will be released this June.
The company also reaffirmed its commitment in expanding its market share in China, the company’s biggest market in Asia. 
TWE said it sees “tremendous opportunity” to continue growing its share of the imported wine market from the current sub 5% level by leveraging its brands and multiple country of origin portfolio, particularly from France, the biggest source for China’s imported wine. 
“We also see tremendous opportunity to expand our penetration into more cities and across more partners in China. We have an ambition to expand our presence and availability by more than 50% in the next three years,” said company CEO Michael Clark.
“The French category is one where the Company is particularly focussed on gaining share given it is the largest import category, accounting for around 30 to 40% of the market, and remains highly fragmented. TWE will aim to build on its existing French country of origin proposition, Maison de Grand Esprit, using the Penfolds and Beaulieu Vineyard brands,” the company explains. 
ASIA GROWTH
During the first half, Asia remained TWE’s biggest and most profitable market, with a 31% EBITS growth to AU$153.1m and an EBITS margin of 38.9%. NSR grew by 32% driven by increased availability of Luxury and Masstige wine and outstanding sales execution.
Americas reported 12% EBITS growth to AU$112.1m and an EBITS margin of 18.5%. NSR grew 20% through positive execution under the new route-to-market model combined with underlying premiumisation, offset by higher costs of doing business (CODB) reflecting a new sales organisation, and including transitional overhead investment carried above the line, not in material items.
Europe reported 10% EBITS growth to AU$26.3m and an EBITS margin of 15.0%. NSR growth of 10% was driven by Masstige-led premiumisation as well as continued focus on the strengthening of strategic customer partnerships.
Australia & New Zealand (ANZ) reported 13% EBITS growth to $77.4m, and an EBITS margin of 23.2%.
Commenting on the results, TWE’s chief executive officer, Michael Clarke, said: “I am very proud to see the foundation established in the previous years continuing to deliver sustainable growth, as shown by yet another strong set of financial results for the Group. Like in previous years, we’ve delivered on expectations while continuing to implement significant changes to the business and investing for future growth.”

Wineries from 15 countries have confirmed their attendance at the first World Bulk Wine Exhibition in Yantai – China’s most important bulk wine city – in May.

The World Bulk Wine Exhibition (WBWE) Asia will reunite the main international wineries alongside important Asian importers to offer a platform for business, analysis and debate about new trends from the bulk wine industry.
Chile, Australia, France, Georgia, Italy, Macedonia, Moldavia, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Ukraine, Uruguay, China, Brazil and New Zealand have already signed up for the bulk wine show, taking up 70% of the fair’s occupancy, three months prior to the actual fair.
The high occupancy signals wineries’ strong interest in China as a major wine importing country, currently ranked as the world’s fifth biggest wine importer.
The hosting city, Yantai, is known as China’s ‘City of Wine’ and the country’s most important port of entry for bulk wine. More than 80% of the bulk wine that enters China each year is via the port of Yantai. This means 135 million litres out of China’s overall volume of 170 million litres entered via Yantai, according to official data.
The exhibition will take place on 30-31 May at the Yantai International Expo Centre.

The concept of food and wine pairing in Asia is “a waste of time” due to the banqueting culture there, according to Hong Kong based Master of Wine Sarah Heller.
Sarah Heller MW believes the concept of food and wine matching in Asia is “a waste of time”
Speaking at the second International Sauvignon Blanc celebration in Marlborough last month, Heller told attendees:
“Food and wine pairing is a waste of time in Asia as there is a lot of eating off a Lazy Susan in a banquet setting involving lots of courses that are only on a table for a bit. Sommeliers should think more holistically about the style of cuisine being served and how certain wines pair with the sweetness and acidity levels in the food.”
During her talk, Heller also pointed out that Asian consumers tend to prefer more evocative descriptions when it comes to a wine’s character, rather than specific flavours that may be present in the wine.
“Producers need to be using more evocative terms and abstract images in China when it comes to wine. People think the more specific you get the easier the wine will be to understand, but Chinese people prefer terms like ‘mellow’, ‘rounded’ and ‘soft’ to describe wine,” she said.
Social media influencers like Shenghan-Wang, founder of wine platform ‘Lady Penguin’, are a good way of attracting a new audience to your wines in Asia
According to Heller, producers should be targeting millennial consumers in China, as “50% of wine consumers in China are under 30”.
She also spoke of the importance of premium packaging in order to lure new consumers into the wine category. “In China it’s important for wine to be seen as classy. Cartoon and critter labels will have a hard time selling there. People go for heavier glass bottles in Asia and they like a deep punt – there’s something oddly Freudian going on there,” Heller joked.
She also advised that gold was good when it comes to wine labels in China, but to steer clear of green. “Green is not a lucky colour in China – the phrase ‘to wear a green hat’ means being a cuckold,” she said.
Asia is a dynamic market for wine. According to Debra Meiburg there are 819 billionaires and counting in Asia. In terms of making inroads with Sauvignon Blanc in Asia, Meiberg said it will be difficult as there isn’t a culture of serving cold drinks at a meal.
“Most Asians find it strange to serve steaming hot fish with ice cold wine – they think it’s bad for your health and teeth,” she said, pointing out that fish is usually served at the end of a meal in Asia.
However, she stressed the importance of winning listings at fine dining restaurants as a way of increasing visibility. “Get into the top Michelin starred restaurants in Asia if you want to establish yourself as a luxury brand,” Meiburg said.
She also stressed the need for strong Sauvignon Blanc brands to emerge in New Zealand to compete with Cloudy Bay, as “all the labels look the same at the moment”.
Meiburg advised producers to engage with “key opinion leaders” in Asia as a way of reaching new consumers. “To do well you have to have a presence in the e-commerce market and on social media. Influencers are super powerful in Asia, there are even people who train them,” she said.

Georges Vigouroux, a winemaker considered by many as a pioneer of French Malbec who helped revive the Cahors region, has died aged 83.
Vigouroux passed away on 7 February. He was one of the winemakers who helped revive Cahors in the 1970s, the southern French wine region having been devastated by Phylloxera in the 19th century.
In 1971 plantings in Cahors covered just 440 hectares. That same year Vigouroux acquired the Château de Haut Serre and replanted the old vineyards.
He was among a new wave of winemakers who began investing in the region and brought it back from the brink.
In 1983 he also acquired the Château de Mercuès, owned by Relais & Châteaux, and built a winery and restaurant, ‘Le Dueze’.
It was an early dip into the waters of oeno-tourism and the property (its restaurant also having a Michelin star) are renowned to this day as an important part of luxury wine tourism in the region.
Vigouroux handed over the running of the company to his son, Bertrand Gabriel, over the course of the last decade.

At a tasting in London yesterday, Laura Catena revealed her “100-year plan” for Nicolás Catena Zapata – her top-end Argentine label now sold through La Place de Bordeaux.
She was speaking at the first UK-based sampling of the current and previous vintages of Nicolás Catena Zapata, along with Adrianna Mundus Bacillus Terrae, since the Argentine wine producer started selling its flagship labels through the Bordeaux négociant network, a move that was announced in September last year.
Having been asked by wine writer Anthony Rose for her motivation to list her priciest wines on ‘La Place’, she told the attendees of the tasting that is was part of her “100-year plan” to ensure all major wine lovers had a bottle of Catena in their cellar.
“I want every collector in the world to have Nicolás Catena Zapata in their cellar – that is my dream,” she said, when justifying her reason for selling the top-end Argentine label through La Place de Bordeaux.
Continuing, she said, “I want to be in every single cellar, that is the 100-year plan, but hopefully, by the time I die, my wine will be in most cellars – and I hope I don’t die before that, so please help me die happy.”
Explaining further the connection between her “dream” for Catena’s distribution and the Bordeaux négociant network, she said that it was only through La Place that she believed that she could ensure a truly global reach.
“We work with fantastic importers around the world including Bibendum in the UK, but I feel that in order for more people to taste these wines and become ambassadors for them, and to increase the audience for people who collect wine, I needed to go for this broader distribution.”
She had previously commented that her “goal” – like her father’s, Nicolás Catena – was “to make Argentine wine stand alongside the best in the world.”
And, as part of this, she said, “If I want them to be considered among the great wines of the world, then I need real proof, and if the collectors are buying my wines, then I have achieved this goal.”
As reported by the drinks business in September last year, the Argentine winery said that its ‘Nicolás Catena Zapata 2015’ and ‘Adrianna Vineyard Mundus Bacillus Terrae Malbec 2015’ will be the first wines to be sold through 10 merchants on La Place.
The addition of Catena Zapata’s wines to La Place follows others from beyond the borders of Bordeaux who are represented by the region’s merchants, most notably Opus One, Masseto, Almaviva and, another new addition last year, Francis Ford Coppola’s Inglenook.

The organisers of the first edition of Wine Paris that took place this week have claimed the show met and even exceeded its aims for visitor numbers, setting a “benchmark as a key event in the wine professional’s calendar” in the process.
In a statement, the show’s organisers said 26,700 visitors, including 30% from outside France, had walked through the doors during the three day event in the French capital.
Held in Paris from 11-13 February, Wine Paris was the first edition of a show that brought together VinoVision – a show for France’s northern regions – and the longstanding Vinisud – an exhibition for Mediterranean wines.
Organisers Comexposium and the Adhesion Group had said prior to the show they hoped for around 25,000 visitors with 20-30% coming from outside France.
On the basis of the final figures for the show they have declared, those targets have been met.
The majority of foreign visitors, accounting for around 51%, were from the UK, US, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.
The show gathered together over 2,000 producers from all of France’s major regions as well as exhibitors from Italy, Spain, Portugal and other countries.
The Rhône, Loire and Languedoc were the most heavily represented regions.
Pierre Clément, chairman of the Cool Climate Association, said: “Our two respective trade fairs have put aside their regional ambitions to prioritise the city of Paris in 2019 and for years to come. Businesses within the wine industry have wholeheartedly expressed support for this project and are defending a common interest in the success of the event.”
Fabrice Rieu, chairman of the Association of Mediterranean Wine Regions, added: “For all the long-standing marketing boards taking part in Vinisud – Languedoc, Pays d’Oc, Roussillon, Rhone Valley, South-West, Provence and Corsica – Wine Paris 2019 has proven to be a real success! The trust placed in us by our exhibitors has given us reason to be enthusiastic and ensure the show’s long-term future with a new event in 2020 in Paris, creating a perfect opportunity for targeting export markets outside the EU which are essential for the development of our wine regions.”
The organisers went on to say that “nearly 70%” of the exhibitors have confirmed their presence on an increased scale for the second edition of the show, to be held from 10-12 February 2020.

Rioja producer Marqués de Cáceres has released its latest edition of Generación MC from the 2016 vintage, unveiling the new label design at wine and flamenco festival SIMOF.
Launched at the end of 2018, the new limited-edition wine is made from the 2016 vintage. Generación MC is only made in the best vintages and every year, a bottle is presented at the Salon Internacional de la Moda Flamenca (SIMOF).
For each vintage, the producer commissions a special label, with the this year’s example unveiled at SIMOF 2019 designed by Virginia Vargas, a flamenco fashion expert.
It is inspired by “the distinct and outstanding personality of the designer Aurora Gaviño”, who is depicted on the label. Fashion designer Gaviño is also the founder of SIMOF and presents a her new collection of designs every year at the show.
Th 2016 edition of Generación MC is made with 100% Tempranillo from vines that are between 65 and 90 years old. The grapes are hand-harvested in 15kg boxes and undergo a slow fermentation of between 10 and 12 days with a proportion of whole bunches. The wine is aged in new French oak barrels for 15 months before being aged in bottle for six months before release.
A total of 15,957 bottles were produced from 55 new French oak barrels.
According to Marqués de Cáceres: “Generación MC Limited Edition by Aurora Gaviño reveals the perfect harmony between the beauty of flamenco fashion and the exquisite character of a wine that expresses with aplomb elegance, balance, fullness, intense colour and brio.”
“This unique wine captures the efforts and the passion of the bodega’s oenologists who meticulously handcraft a few small parcels of old vines with creativity and innovative inspiration so as to extract their very essence. The result is their interpretation of a younger more modern style in this superb wine of profound, human roots.”

Toxic alcohol ‘laced with methanol’ has killed at least 99 people in India, with many more admitted to hospital having consumed bootleg liquor.
At least 99 people have already died from consuming illegal alcohol laced with methanol.
In one district of Uttar Pradesh, 59 people died after consuming toxic alcohol, as reported by The Guardian. In a neighbouring district, a senior police officer said nine had died, with another 31 confirmed dead in Uttarakhand state. 
So far, 66 suspected bootleggers have been arrested and samples of the liquor sent to a laboratory for testing.
 “We are trying to find out the main source of this illicit liquor. We will soon [find] the main culprit behind this tragedy,” Janmejay Khanduri, a senior Uttarakhand police official, said.
Police suspect the moonshine had been laced with methanol, with many victims complaining of dizziness.
Of the estimated 5 billion litres of alcohol consumed every year in India, about 40% is illegally produced, according to the International Spirits and Wine Association of India, with hundreds dying from consuming cheap alcohol. 
Particularly in rural India, bootleggers often add methanol, a highly toxic form of alcohol sometimes used as antifreeze, to their product to increase its strength. Methanol can cause blindness, liver damage and death.
In 2015, more than 100 people died in a Mumbai slum after drinking moonshine.

"For the sixth consecutive year, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti was the most valuable label sold at Sotheby’s auctions – with sales greater than Petrus, Lafite and Latour combined."," 15th February, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/02/drc-leads-sothebys-sales-once-again/,"15th February, 2019

For the sixth consecutive year, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti was the most valuable label sold at Sotheby’s auctions – with sales greater than Petrus, Lafite and Latour combined.
Late last year the auction house announced that total sales across its auction and retail arms had topped US$100 million for the first time.
Sotheby’s fine wine department enjoyed something of a landmark 2018, with several new records set. Not only were total sales the highest they’ve ever been, the department also sold the most expensive bottle of wine ever (a 1945 DRC), topped its own internal record for most expensive bottle of spirits (a 60 year-old 1926 Macallan) and broke its own retail record (US$1.5 million for seven Methuselahs of DRC).
In terms of the regions and labels that dominated the Sotheby’s sale scene in 2018, it was very much a Bordeaux and Burgundy duet with the two regions accounting for 88% of sales by volume, up from 80% in 2017.
Bordeaux had the larger share of volume sales (46%) but Burgundy’s hit 42%, its highest ever level and both Asia and North America saw increased demand for wines from the Côte d’Or though Europe’s dropped from a 21% share to 5% – prices getting too hot perhaps?
The average price per bottle for Burgundy was $1,700 and $804 for Bordeaux, respective rises of 65% and 63% versus 2017. The highest bottle prices at both auction and retail though were for spirits; $9,796 and $1,813 respectively.
The highest average bottle price for an individual label was for The Macallan at $15,067, 27% up on 2017.
The next highest bottle price was for DRC, which saw bottle prices rise a stunning 87% to $8,813. Petrus saw prices rise 33% to $4,072 per bottle on average and Leroy saw prices go up 42% to $2,033 a bottle on average.
When it came to total sales though there was no competition. DRC alone saw total sales of $24m (up from $12m in 2017), comprising almost a quarter, 21%, of Sotheby’s total sales. Although spectacular, there’s no doubt that DRC’s success this year was driven in no small measure by the ex-cellar collection from the Drouhin family.
That collection, sold in New York in October, was the same sale that saw the 1945 Romanée-Conti sell for over $500,000 and the collection as a whole made just over $7m. Add the $1.5m from the sale of the seven Methuselahs in Hong Kong and those two moments alone (barely a month apart) account for nearly $9m.
Either way, DRC’s total sales were more than total sales of Petrus ($8m), Lafite ($7m) and Latour ($7m) combined.
Interestingly, in line with the recent Fine Wine Power 100 ranking from Liv-ex, Leroy was a much more visible player at auctions in 2018, rising from fifth to second place in the Burgundy producer rankings; with sales up from $1m in 2017 to $4m in 2018.

The CEO of a Canadian vodka producer has been left puzzled after thieves stole 30,000 litres of iceberg water from a tank, worth between CAN$9,000 and $12,000.

The staff at Toronto-based Iceberg Vodka were shocked to discover that 30,000 litres of precious iceberg water had been drained from one of their storage tanks earlier this week.
CEO David Meyers told Canadian media that the theft was discovered on Monday (11 February) after one of 10 tanks inside the company’s warehouse in Port Union was drained.
Speaking to CBC News, Meyers said: “We were shocked that we would be missing 30,000 litres of our precious water. We store it in secure tanks and we never, ever would have expected anyone to take such a quantity of water.”
The quantity of vodka stolen was enough to produce 150,000 bottles of vodka.

Meyer added: “We’re talking about a significant amount of water here. Who would want it and what would they do with it? I mean, we’re scratching our head, I have to say.”
Police have valued the water at been $9,000 and $12,000 – a quantity that is enough to fill a tractor trailer, according to Meyers.
Iceberg Vodka is one of several companies in the area to have a licence to harvest water from icebergs. The water is collected once a year when a crew sails out to the icebergs off the Newfoundland coast. There’s only a short window in which they can do this – usually in late spring.
“Think about a grape harvest to make wine, you only have one crack at it a year. It’s the same thing with icebergs,” Meyers added.
The police believe that the incident occurred at some point between Friday 8 February and Monday 11 February, and have asked anyone with information to contact Bonavista Royal Canadian Mounted Police or Crime Stoppers.

Jameson Irish Whiskey, which is produced by Irish Distillers in Midleton Distillery, has announced the launch of a second batch of Jameson Bow Street 18 Years Cask Strength ahead of St Patrick’s Day.
Available from August 2019, the second batch follows on from the first Bow Street cask-strength whiskey last year.
It is the only cask strength Jameson to be available globally, and is finished in Dublin’s only live maturation house in the Jameson Distillery Bow Street.
Distilled and matured at the Midleton Distillery, Co. Cork, Jameson Bow Street 18 Years Cask Strength is a blend of both pot still and grain whiskeys distilled in the late 1990s and aged for 18 years in both ex-Bourbon and Sherry casks.
These whiskeys are then married together and filled into first-fill ex-Bourbon American casks for a final six to 12 months in the Maturation House at the Jameson Distillery Bow Street. ‘Marrying’ is a traditional method of re-casking batches of vatted whiskey and re-warehousing it to ensure infusion before bottling.
Billy Leighton, master blender at Midleton Distillery, said: “As a tribute to the Jameson distilling legacy in Smithfield, we’ve introduced some methods that would have been employed in days past. The final maturation period in Bow Street is our nod to the traditional “marrying” method. We’ve put our own Jameson stamp on it by using first-fill Bourbon barrels, whereas the traditional approach would be to use casks multiple times. I like to think of the whiskey getting engaged in Midleton and then “married” in Dublin!”
The bottle features 18 “facets”, one for each year of maturation, and a unique copper coin located underneath Jameson Bow Street 18 Years Cask Strength bottles provides Jameson fans with access to an exclusive online portal.
The second batch is bottled at 55.1% ABV, without the use of chill filtration, and will be available in 20 markets from August 2019 at the RRP of €240.

English wine estate Wiston has received planning permission for a multi-million pound project to increase the size of its winery and more than double its production capacity.
The plans for the winery entrance
The Sussex-based winery submitted its plans for the development to the South Downs National Park Authority this week. Yesterday, it received “unanimous support” for the project which is set to transform its winery and the surrounding area.
Wiston now has permission to demolish, convert, replace and extend its current winery and offices at North Farm, in addition to building holiday accommodation.
Following a record harvest last year, the wine estate will more than double its production capacity, moving from an average of 120,000 bottles a year to 250,000.
Kirsty Goring, marketing director at Wiston, told the drinks business that demolition will start in 10 days time and that the team is hoping to open the new winery in the summer of 2020.
The development will also increase the estate’s scope for hosting vineyard and winery tours, while a restored flint barn will function both as a pop-up events space for public and private functions, as well as a bar area.
The plans for North Farm Courtyard
Goring added: “We couldn’t be more excited about rediscovering these old farm buildings and giving them a new lease of life in order to help connect people once more to the produce of this land.
“We have been delighted to see our wines increasingly draw people in from all over the country (and the world) and it will be a dream come true to be able to welcome many more of them into the heart of the winery.”
Richard Goring, CEO of Wiston, added: “Ever since the Wiston winery was established at North Farm in 2008, there has been a desire to restore this site. 40 years ago it was a rural hub of productivity and employment and we are delighted that today the SDNPA have supported our vision to rebuild it and create a gateway to the wider Wiston Estate and the beautiful Sussex landscape which has been a part of our family for generations.”
The plans have been drawn up by London-based ECE Architecture and have taken 18 months to be developed.
The plans for the tasting room
The Wiston Estate has been owned and managed by the Goring family since 1743. The Gorings planting their first vines in 2006 with a 16-acre plot of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier.
Winemaker Dermot Sugrue joined the team in 2008 and among its quirks, the estate boasts a 1973 Coquard basket press, the only such press in the UK and one of only four, it claims, outside of France.
In June 2018, Wiston appointed South African specialist Swig Wines as its exclusive London on-trade distributor.

The days of using pesticides and herbicides in the grape growing process are numbered according to Villa Maria Estate’s viticulturist, Jonathan Hamlet.
Villa Maria’s viticulturist Jonathan Hamlet believes the days of using herbicides and pesticides in grape growing are numbered
Speaking at the second International Sauvignon Blanc Celebration in Marlborough, New Zealand, last month, Hamlet told attendees:
“The way we grow grapes today will not be acceptable in the future. We need to respect the land, learn to adapt, and stop using pesticides and herbicides. We live in a world of conscious, value driven consumers who want products that reflect their values. We need to listen to them as they hold the power.”
Jonathan Hamlet and his furry friend
In order to produce quality fruit with great resilient, Hamlet stressed the need for winemakers in New Zealand to look after their land.
“We need to focus on value not volume. New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is unique and special and has put us in an enviable position in the world market but we can’t stand still, we have to be proactive in making changes.
“Marlborough is coming into a long season of redevelopment and we need to plan for the future as we’ve got 40 years of re-planting ahead of us.
“We’re far more advanced and confident now and are incorporating organic practices more successfully. Organics is profoundly simple – it’s growing without synthetic products. It can be expensive initially but is worth it in the long run,” he said.
Hamlet also spoke of the importance of finding an effective alternative to copper in tackling downy mildew.
“The use of copper among organic growers in New Zealand is extremely low. There aren’t consistently effective alternatives to copper at the moment but a lot of trials are being done,” he said.
There are currently 1,715 hectares of certified organic vineyards in New Zealand, accounting for 4.5% of total vineyard area.
Central Otago leads the way in organic viticulture with 16% of vineyards in the region certified organic. New Zealand exports NZ$46m of organic wine a year. The global market for organic produce is growing by 10% per year.

New year, new destination for Amphora’s intrepid senior management team as we made our debut recently in Chandigarh, the ‘Garden City’, about fours hours by train north of Delhi. It is very encouraging for fine wine investors to know that there are so many places where the concept is still new. Not only that but on this occasion we invited 40, expected 25, and fully 50 interested parties showed up!
That creates certain pressures when there are only so many bottles of Haut-Brion 2003 you can take through customs into India. Usually we will prepare the palate for a blind-tasting with a glass of bubbly but in deference to times past the hotel in its wisdom brought out glasses of whisky!
This is yet another thing colonial Britain has to answer for. Intuitively you wouldn’t choose whisky in a hot climate, but for many years, until quite recently in fact, accepted wisdom held that only two alcoholic beverages were consumed in India: beer and whisky. As regular readers of this column will know, the India we have been discovering over the last four years has been falling hook line and sinker for the grape. Grain still has its place, but many people particularly from younger generations are now opting for wine.
While there is always a great deal of interest in the proposition itself, as soon as we disclose that the secondary market is denominated in sterling, the Brexit question arises. We have written about the currency impact of Brexit several times in recent weeks and are not about to go over it all again now, other than to report on the position new investors were most comfortable with.
In short, the evidence of previous sterling declines is that the fine wine market benefits as prices become cheaper for foreign investors. In the event of a ‘no deal Brexit’ which most people seem keen to avoid, sterling’s decline will be partially offset by rising wine prices, so under this ‘least likely’ scenario (least likely because most people seem keen to avoid it, no other reason), foreign investors are partly hedged.
In the event of a deal we suspect sterling will rebound 10% and foreign investors will immediately make a currency turn. How so? Sterling firmed up two weeks ago simply on the strength of an amendment to take no deal off the table being debated in Parliament, so there is likely to be a relief rally once a deal is struck.
In this circumstance wouldn’t fine wine prices logically fall? As we have discussed in recent weeks the relationship isn’t that linear. Furthermore, fine wine prices respond to feelings of economic well-being. If no deal represents short-term chaos, presumably a deal represents short-term stability.
Those who had some experience of fine wine were keen to learn whether we thought the Burgundy rally had any more legs. Our first note of this year showcased Amphora MD David Jackson looking for interest in top end Burgundy to trickle down to secondary producers.
Look back a decade and Bordeaux first growths were in their China frenzy phase, advancing from premia over second to fifth growth wines of just over 100% to multiples of the price. We all know what happened after that, but we note with interest that investments in ‘second label’ wines even allowing for the correction have advanced to the tune of 700% over the last 10 years. Let’s take Petit Mouton 2006 as an example:

For sure, Burgundy has outperformed more recently, but that is not quite the argument. If buyers were attracted to the Mouton name, even packaged as a ‘Petit Mouton’, and the discounted price (on first release Mouton 2006 was not far short of 10x the price of Petit Mouton 2006), does this hold any clues for what may lie ahead with the Burgundy sector?
We currently see tier 1 Burgundy trading at well over £100,000 per case, but tier 2 wines are literally a fraction of the price. Ponsot Clos de la Roche, one of the all-time greats, costs around £5,000 a case, and Clos de Lambrays about £1,500. Now we fully accept that betting on the next big thing is always something of a punt, but in a diversified portfolio we believe the potential rewards more than match the risk.
Talking of Ponsot, it is one of the most prestigious producers in Burgundy, indeed it was Domaine Ponsot that brought down the famous fraudster Rudi Kurniawan, who made the rather elementary mistake of ‘replicating’ a bottle from a vintage that the Domaine never actually released.
The level of detail at Ponsot is second to none. There is no sorting table because each below par grape is painstakingly removed from the vine in advance of the harvest. They use no chemicals and pay assiduous attention to the cycles of the moon, and this attention to detail means that wines from the estate are among the most desirable in the world.
So, when you look at, say, the 2012 vintage, you find Roumier changing hands at £105,000 a case, and Leroy’s Chambertin around £115,000. In terms of outright desirability we accept that Ponsot Clos de la Roche Vieilles Vignes is not quite as good, but there really isn’t much in it. There absolutely isn’t £100,000 worth of difference, but the Ponsot can be had for just over £5,000 a case. This looks absurd to us, because it is. And well worth the ‘gamble’.

The strength of the carbon emissions created during the wine fermentation process is ‘five times more concentrated than planes and cars’, according to UC Davis professor, Roger Boulton.
Winemakers need to work out ways to capture the carbon emitted during the fermentation process
Speaking at the second international Sauvignon Blanc Celebration in Marlborough last month, the chemical engineering professor told attendees that the need for winemakers to capture their carbon emissions was one of the most pressing environmental issues facing the industry.
“Carbon footprints have been pushed into a corner. Winemakers have to measure their footprints, own them and be proud of them. The elephant in the room of the carbon world in wineries is fermentation.

“We should be capturing carbon in wineries so they become carbon neutral. Carbon from the winemaking process is five times more concentrated than planes and cars. A litre of juice produces 60 litres of carbon dioxide. Why aren’t we trapping it?”
“A single bottle of wine contains 80g of carbon dioxide. As a winemaker, if you want to be a serious leader in sustainability then you have to capture your carbon emissions – a good way to so this is to turn it into chalk,” he said.
Spanish wine giant Torres has been leading the way in developing technology that successfully captures and transforms the carbon dioxide created during fermentation via its CCR (Carbon Capture and Reuse) programme.
So far, Torres’ environmental team has carried out tests with eight different technologies offering alternative uses for the CO2 produced during fermentation. One such experiment uses organic compounds to capture CO2 to create a product that can be used in the paint industry.
Another has seen Torres explore the use of seawater electrolysis to generate a low carbon footprint basic solution that can be later used to capture CO2 in the form of inorganic carbonate, which can be stored safely on earth as a solid carbonate rather than escaping into the atmosphere.

"The managing director of Champagne Castelnau, Pascal Prudhomme, believes Brexit might give his brand a competitive advantage as it heads towards an ambitious sales target for 2020."," 15th February, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/02/brexit-could-be-good-for-champagne-castelnau-says-md/,"15th February, 2019

The managing director of Champagne Castelnau, Pascal Prudhomme, believes Brexit might give his brand a competitive advantage as it heads towards an ambitious sales target for 2020.
Speaking to the drinks business in Champagne last month, Prudhomme said that Champagne Castelnau has hit a new high in sales, adding 100,000 bottles to its 2017 total of 760,000, ensuring the brand is on track to hit a target of 1m bottles by 2020 – a milestone number set by the manager a few years ago following a rebrand.
However, when asked by db whether Brexit might affect Castelnau’s upwards sales trajectory, especially if one considers the brand’s strong sales in the UK, he said that the country’s break with the European Union could actually favour his Champagne, because it has a wholly-owned subsidiary in the market – Castelnau Wine Agencies.
“There is no solution to Brexit other than shipping a bit more stock now to avoid troubles [with supplying the UK market] in the future,” he said.
Continuing, he told db, “And because we have a UK subsidiary, Brexit could be good for Champagne Castelnau.”
Speaking further, he said that the UK’s break with the EU will only seriously affect sales if it means that the cost of Champagne in Britain goes up sharply, either due to increased tariffs, or exchange rates, or, if the financial sector of the UK sees a major decline – consumption of the upmarket French fizz in Britain is closely connected to the performance of The City.
“If the inflation is not so big for Champagne, and if the financial companies don’t leave London, we could have no change regarding Brexit, although my concern is a devaluation of the pound versus the euro,” he said.
“But for now, there are no consequences, and the best thing for me is to go on as before,” he added.
Then, highlighting a bigger issue for his brand and Champagne as a whole, he commented, “The problem for Champagne is that the sales of less expensive sparkling wines are rising every year, and that is a global problem.”
Echoing the views of president of Champagne Deutz, Fabric Rosset – which you can read here – Prudhomme stressed the significant negative impact of mass demonstrations by the gilets jaunes in France from mid-November onwards.
“The French market has been very tough, and the end of last year was not good due to the demonstrations, which were every Saturday for one and a half months, meaning that sales in wine shops and restaurants were down,” he commented.
To further illustrate the impact of the movement, which included acts of vandalism in the key shopping districts of Paris, as well as road blocks across the country, he said that the hospitality sector in France had lost almost half of its customers.
“Bookings in restaurants in December were down 40% and hotels by 35%, mostly in Paris, and there was no mood to drink Champagne,” he said.
Recording that global Champagne shipments for 2018 had dropped by 5m bottles to 302m, he said, “The majority of that decline has come from the French market.”
However, he said that he was forecasting worse. “I was expecting it to be 300m or lower, because the trends in October and November were not so good, and December is such an important month [for sales of Champagne].”
As reported by db last month, initial estimates for the past year show that Champagne has shipped 5.3 million bottles fewer than 2017, driven by falling demand in France and the UK.
Champagne Castelnau is owned by the Coopérative Régionale des Vins de Champagne (CRVC). Prudhomme told db that the growers’ cooperative had also achieved a new sales record, shipping a total of three million bottles in 2018. Profit and turnover also risen for the group, according to Prudhomme. “We increased volumes, and turnover, and margins too; we are now at around €65m in turnover – it was an amazing year for us,” he summed up.

UK pubs are still closing at a rate of 14 per week
The number of pub closures has dropped slightly from a rate of 18 a week last year, thanks in part to CAMRA’s success in achieving new local planning protection for pubs in England, but remains high at 14 a week.
Four years ago, the rate was much higher at a rate of 29 per week in 2014. Since then, a number of initiatives have been launched by CAMRA alongside MPs to ease the rate of decline in the on-trade.
In march 2017, the treasury announced it would ease business rates for 90% of pubs, providing a £1,000 discount to business rate bills for all properties with a rateable value below £100,000.
However without further “swift action”, Camra has said it is unlikely that many pub will ever reopen.
“Pubs are a very important part of our national culture and are valuable community assets which help to combat loneliness and social isolation,” said Jackie Parker, CAMRA’s National Chairman. “It’s great we have seen a drop in the number of pubs closing, showing that our hard-fought campaign to get planning protection for pubs was worth it.
“Protecting pubs in the English planning system was a necessity and a welcome move from the Government. However, it’s taken nearly two years for the trickle-down effects of the planning changes to show. Our politicians should back the asks of the Save Our Pubs Campaign in full, and show they are squarely behind pubs.”
Following the UK’s exit from the European Union, the Government will be able to reduce Beer Duty specifically in pubs, according to CAMRA, which it says will help to level the playing field between the price of beer sold in social, community settings and cheap supermarket alcohol consumed at home.
This move is one of three key measures CAMRA believes the Government needs to take to halt the pace of pub closures.
The Campaign is also calling for full reviews both of the Business Rates System to fix the unfair amount pubs pay, and of currently ineffective legislation designed to enable pub tenants to get a fair deal from their big-business property owners – both moves the Government has promised but is yet to carry out.

The true heir to the great pair of harvests that was 2009 and 2010, the 2016 vintage in Bordeaux has been re-scrutinised by various critics of late but how do their scores stack up with the price of the wines?
Mouton’s 2016 was awarded 100 points by four of the major critics: Neal Martin, Lisa Perrotti-Brown MW, Antonio Galloni and James Suckling
Towards the end of last year Liv-ex ran the numbers to see how the 2016 wines had performed since their en primeur campaign in 2017.
Despite the critical success of the vintage it was a fairly up and down campaign, largely hampered by some questionable decisions over stock retention by many châteaux.
Liv-ex found there had been some pretty hefty appreciation for a number of Left and Right Bank wines while others had drifted somewhat. No great surprise all in all.
In December 2018 The Wine Advocate’s Lisa Perrotti-Brown MW became the first big name critic to review the wines in-bottle and issue some scores.
She dished out eight 100 points and said there was no doubt that the vintage was a “new chapter for great Bordeaux”.
Then the in-bottle scores grew in number. Over at Vinous, both Neal Martin and Antonio Galloni both tucked in but came up with some markedly different results.
Galloni’s scores came first. There were seven 100-point wines and a good clutch of 99-pointers. He said that the, “bottled 2016s capture every bit of potential I sensed when I started tasting the wines from the barrel.”
And overall he said, “the best 2016s are powerful, richly layered, vibrant and stunningly beautiful, not to mention incredibly delicious and alluring. For so many wines and estates, 2016 is an epic vintage.”
Martin, in his last gig for TWA, had called the 2016 vintage “unequivocally great” and also awarded eight wines a potential 100-point spread.
So what did he call the wines when he tasted them more recently? “The dog’s bollocks” (which is a ‘good thing’ for those not used to the English idiom).
Only five wines were given 100-points however, La Mission Haut-Brion and Ausone not quite making the grade but Vieux Château Certan, graded 95-97 originally, actually rose in his estimation to be given a ‘perfect’ score second time around.
James Suckling meanwhile declared the vintage one for “today’s Bordeaux wine lovers”, better than 2000 and 2003, every vintage from the 1990s (except 1990 itself) and with only 2005, 2009, 2010 and 2015 being better (the latter only “by a hair”). Like Perrotti-Brown he awarded eight 100-point scores.
Critically speaking, therefore, the vintage is clearly top trumps. The one wine to get 100-points across all four critics was Mouton Rothschild, with Haut-Brion and Cos d’Estournel getting three out of four.
The only outliers, which were marked topmost by one of the critics but none of the others were: Figeac (Martin), Palmer, Pichon Lalande and Tertre Rotebeouf (Galloni), Cheval Blanc (Perroti-Brown) and Pavie, Le Pin and Lafite (Suckling).
Those are the top scores but what about where that leaves the wines stacking up with respect to relative value?
Liv-ex, using the new scores, ran the numbers again and by its metrics although the wines have an average price of just over £3,500 a case, which is the same as the 2015s, they actually have a better average score than that previous vintage.
They also have a slightly better average score than the 2010s and roughly the same as the 2009 (a hair better in fact), both vintages where the average price is over £4,000 a case.
Placing the 2016s into the context of the last 10 years, therefore, Liv-ex said the vintage falls on the right side of what would be considered ‘fair value’.
And what of individual labels, which of those represent the ‘best value’?
Well, happily, according to Liv-ex about two thirds of the big name châteaux fall on the ‘fair’ side of the trend line.
Clinet comes across as offering the best value for money, followed by Margaux the one first growth that none of the major critics awarded 100-points to yet which is hardly slacking with scores such as 98 from Neal Martin.
Mouton Rothschild, with its straight 100s from Martin, Suckling, Galloni and Perrotti-Brown was also considered fair value as were the other top favourites Cos d’Estournel and Haut-Brion.
Vieux Château Certan, another wine that picked up a couple of 100 points and was generally highly ranked, was just over the line which indicates it offers slightly less value.
Yet this is only because it is commanding a comparatively high price given its scores than Mouton or Cos.
Once the market digests these scores and the calls come in to pick up this label or that, it’s highly likely that in a few months time after market activity has pushed a few prices upwards, the likes of Mouton, Cos and others will be joining VCC on the other side of the line.
It’s important to remember however that the notion of a particular label offering more or less value is always relative.

US auction house Hart Davis Hart’s first fine wine sale of 2019 got off to a flying start making US$8 million, nearly US$1m over the pre-sale high estimate.
Held in Chicago, the two day sale featured wines from the cellar of a noted collector, David Utterberg, which realised US$1.6m of the total result.
Over 1,000 bidders from all over the world drove over 60% of the lots to final prices that exceeded their pre-sale estimates.
From the Utterberg collection there was strong bidding for Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, Domaine Ponsot, Henri Jayer and Méo-Camuzet.
Another collection from Johnson Ho & The Pantheon Wine Shoppe was slightly more claret focused with cases of Petrus and Cheval Blanc leading the way as well as Chambolle-Musigny from Georges Roumier.
The rest of the sale featured blue chip wines from Burgundy, California, Bordeaux, Italy and Champagne. There was a sizeable line-up of wines from Bruno Giacosa dating back to the 1970s that was strongly bid after.
The sale’s top lot was a 12 bottle case of 1990 La Tâche which went for $101,575, closely followed by a dozen of Domaine Ponsot’s 1985 Clos de la Roche at $95,600.

A new study by the University of Queensland has uncovered a link between taste perception and brain size, revealing that bitterness is perceived as less intense by those with larger brains.

In a new study entitled ‘Associations between brain structure and perceived intensity of sweet and bitter tastes’ published in Behavioural Brain Research journal, scientists examined the relationship between brain size and the perception of sweetness and bitterness.
According to the University of Queensland’s Diamantina Institute Postdoctoral Research fellow, Dr Daniel Hwang, this is the first time that they have been linked.
The study examined “the volumes of 82 regions of interest and the perceived intensities” of sweet and bitter flavours “in a large Australian healthy cohort” and the “perceived intensity of quinine in a large US healthy cohort”.
Over 1,600 people from Australia and America participated in the study and were instructed to taste five bitter and four sweet solutions and to rate their perceived intensities using a “general labelled magnitude scale”. Quinine, a key ingredient in tonic water, was used to assess their response to a bitter taste.
Each participant’s brain was then measured using an MRI scan.
The article concluded: “This study provides the first evidence that, even in healthy people, variation in brain structure is associated with taste intensity ratings, and provides new insights into the brain gustatory circuit.
“In this exploratory study…we showed that brain morphometry tended to relate with perceived intensity of sweet and bitter tastes. The strongest and most robust association was between the left entorhinal cortex volume and quinine intensity. Individuals having larger entorhinal volumes [rated] the quinine solutions as less intense.
The entorhinal cortex is located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain and is associated with memory formation, navigation, the perception of time, and odour and visual perception.
Dr Hwang said that his team’s findings proved that brain size not only influences a person’s IQ, but also the way they perceive certain flavours.
“Everyone wants to know why we like certain foods and why individuals have preferences for bitter or sweet tastes,” he said.
“It was unclear if brain size affected anything other than a person’s IQ, but now we can show it relates to how we perceive food and drink.
“Whether you enjoy tonic water or not, people with bigger brains typically find it less bitter.
“We found that the left side of the entorhinal cortex, an area of the brain responsible for memory, odour and visual perception, was larger in people who found quinine to be less bitter.
“Our study is a step towards understanding exactly how the brain perceives taste.”
Dr Hwang added that the findings could now be used to alter treatment for eating disorders.
“The findings have implications for improving dietary behaviour and treating eating disorders. By targeting specific areas in the gustatory cortex, we could treat eating disorders using methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, a non-invasive treatment currently used to treat mental illness,” he said.

While food and wine matching is one of the most important roles of the sommelier, Master of Wine Tim Hanni has dismissed the concept as “bullsh*t”.
Master of Wine Tim Hanni has dismissed the concept of food and wine matching, and doesn’t believe a perfect pairing exists
Speaking at the 2019 Sauvignon Blanc Celebration in Marlborough last month, Hanni spoke passionately about the need to completely rethink the concept of food and wine pairing.
“A perfect wine pairing doesn’t exist. We’re doing a lot of damage the way we’re matching wine and categorising it. We need to start a campaign to stop wine and food pairing as we’ve created a lot of bullsh*t around the idea.
Tim Hanni MW would like to put an end to food and wine pairing
“A lot of people enjoy being arrogant about wine and consider entry-level wines as being unsophisticated. We need to educate the trade to better serve the personal interests of wine lovers.
“We need to celebrate the diversity of consumers, not make them feel stupid. You can serve Sauvignon Blanc with steak – why not?”
Echoing Sarah Heller MW’s opinion, Hanni warned that those who believe food and wine pairing has potential in China will be in for an unpleasant surprise.
“Thinking wine and food pairing will work in China will cause one of the biggest disasters in the wine industry we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Hanni also controversially said that France has “no history of food and wine matching” – “we made that up”, he said.
“We need to get over the notion that food and wine grew up together. Food and wine matching is pseudo science full of metaphors and misunderstandings,” he said.
He also pointed out that many of the revered French wines enjoyed today used to taste very different. “Montrachet used to be sweet and Cheval Blanc 1947 has 30g/l of sugar in it.”
With regards to New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, Hanni stressed the need for the different styles of the variety to be made clearer to consumers to avoid confusion.
“Otherwise it will all become noise and people will go back to beer and cocktails. Riesling has threatened to be the next big thing since the 1960s, but it never happened because there are too many different styles,” Hanni said.

At the launch of London’s first ever saké week last night, Hiroki Oizumi, who is director general for the JFOODO promotion centre, highlighted the food pairing versatility of this distinctive Japanese drink.
Picture credit: foodandsake.com
Speaking at the Four Seasons Hotel London at Ten Trinity Square, Oizumi, who heads up The Japan Food Product Overseas Promotion Centre (JFOODO), said that saké had immense potential in London restaurants due to its ability to match a broad range of dishes.
“In Japan, we have a saying ‘saké and food never fight,’” he began.
Continuing, he commented, “Those who have woken up to the versatility of saké have learned that it has unique attributes that, when taken with food, amplify the flavours of both and reveal the hidden depths in the saké.”
Also speaking at the launch-event, which took place within the hotel’s Mei Ume Japanese fusion food restaurant, was Jan Konetzki, who is director of wine at the Four Seasons Ten Trinity Square.
Although a sommelier and wine expert, Konetzki said he has developed a deep respect for saké’s history and quality, while noting how perceptions of the drink have changed significantly in the UK over the past decade.
““It has been 10 years since I tasted saké for the first time and since then the perception of it has changed completely: from a drink that was typically served warm, it has developed into a well-regarded and more sophisticated beverage that can stand confidently next to the finest food produced,” he said.
“For me, saké is one of the most artisanal beverages in the world, alongside Champagne, Port and whisky,” he added.
Later in the evening, during a discussion with the drinks business, he stressed that saké could be used to complement a wide range of foods, and not just Japanese cuisine.
In particular, he mentioned it’s suitability for serving with cheese, while recording that he had enjoyed it with typically European dishes, such as spaghetti Bolognese.
London Saké Week activities will run across restaurants in the capital from Friday 22 February to Sunday 3 March.
The initiative is being led by (JFOODO), established by the government of Japan, which is working in partnership with outlets across London to give diners the chance to experience saké brands with a range of food pairings as part of London Saké Week.
Among the restaurants taking part are Coya, La Fromagerie, Roka and Nobu – click here to see the full list of participating places in the capital.
According to the Japanese organisation, more than 500 restaurants in London now offer saké on their menu, and many of these are not-Japanese.
To showcase the potential of saké with food, guests at the launch event in London last night were introduced to six specially selected sakés alongside Mei Ume signature’s dishes created by head chef Tony Truong.
Among these were Tosatsuru Azure Ginjo with yellowtail Nigir; Katsuyama ‘Lei’ Junmai Ginjo with salt and pepper squid, lemon leaves and shallots, as well as Keigetsu Aikawa Homare Tokubetsu Junmai with scallop sashimi (pictured below).

Over 30 producers from Oregon and Washington state will promote their region’s wines at a tasting in London next month.

A total of 35 wineries will pour 250 wines at the event on 14 March, including wineries with existing UK distribution links, as well as a number of businesses seeking importers including Delille Cellars, Betz Family Wines, and Matthew Winery from Washington and Patton Valley Vineyards, Rivers Edge and Voix de La Vigne from Oregon.
Oregon’s wine sales have grown significantly in recent months. Sales of Oregon wines soared from US$529 million to $550m last year, helped along by direct and wholesale buyers, with retail wine sales in the US up 16% over the 52 weeks ending 11 August 2018, according to Nielsen data. Last year 94,351 cases went overseas.
While the state is perhaps best known for Pinot Noir, the tasting, which will take place from noon until 5:30pm at OXO2 in London, will also showcase other varietals from Oregon such as Chardonnay, Riesling and sparkling wines, according to an emailed statement.
From Washington, there will also be a collection of Syrahs, Bordeaux blends and whites including Chenin, Semillon and Viognier.

The company is a collaboration between food entrepreneur Lucy Wright and former Properccorn and Vita Coco exec Jeremy May and wine importer ABS Wine Agencies.
Its backers include Propercorn founder Cassandra Stavrou and Ryan Kohn.
Tom Elliot, Sainsbury’s  origination & development manager said the listing was a “no brainer”, given the quality of the wine, its mass-market appeal, its convenience for events, and its environmental credentials.
“We have seen fantastic growth in single formats and convenience, and this category has performed phenomenally in the US,” he said.
“We love the brand; the cans will really pop on-shelf. We were also impressed by the two very experienced and ambitious co-founders driving the business forward.”
“We think the convenience element will be especially promising for the picnicking and festival season.”
The retailer already stocks the I heart rosé frizzante in a can as well as PinotPinot sparkling Pinot Grigio, by Off-Piste Wines.
The drink’s #WineForWhenever” brand’s tagline squarely targets younger consumers, playing on its ‘swiggablility’ on the go, its ability to chill quickly and the environmentally-friendly packaging, “We’re here for the wins, the woes, and the why the hell nots,” it said.
Sainsbury’s already stocks Freixenet Copestic’s I heart rosé frizzante in a can as well as PinotPinot sparkling Pinot Grigio, by Off-Piste Wines.
The trend has been tipped for success in the UK, after sales of the format have boomed across the Atlantic. Canned wine sales in the US rose 43% during 2017, driven by millennials seeking out smaller measures and on-the-go options, and Nielsen has valued the category at around $45 million.
Last June, Waitrose launched an organic rosé and Shiraz in cans into its aisles after seeing sales of single bottles rise 10%,  this year added popular Provence rosé Mirabeau to its line-up. The Co-op has also looked at alternative, environmentally friendly packaging with its listing of the Most Wanted pouch in 2017. The brand is also available in cans.
English wine is also joining the trend with new drinks brand The Uncommon releasing the first English wine in a can – a lightly sparkling Bacchus using grapes grown in Surrey.

A vineyard in New South Wales lost most of its 2019 crop after bush fires ripped through the vines just hours before the harvest was due to take place.

As reported by ABC, Topper’s Mountain Wines suffered devastating losses as it geared up to harvest this year’s grapes.
The Tingha Plateau fire, which began on 10 February and was believed to have been caused by a lightning strike, first struck the vineyard’s southerly boundary on 13 February, after strong southerly winds blew drifting embers into the vines.
Speaking to ABC, the owner of Topper’s Mountain Wines, Mark Kirkby, said: “This wall of fire arrived on our southern boundary. Not long after that, it started spotting – that’s when our priorities changed pretty dramatically.
“It all happened in just a few minutes. Initially I was sitting in a chair watching the show – it was pretty impressive.
“And then when it finally got here, I thought bloody hell, this is getting a bit serious.
“The flames were 30 metres high. It was hellish.”
Of the grapes still on the vines, over 70% of the crop was destroyed in the flames with the winery unsure whether the remaining 30% can be used due to smoke taint.
“We couldn’t get from one row to the next quickly enough to slow it down,” Kirkby added. “We’ve probably lost somewhere in the region of AU$500,000. That’s assuming none of the vines have been killed, which would be the worst outcome.”
The winery posted on social media yesterday stating its Sauvignon Blanc grapes planted on the hill had escaped the blaze, having been picked two weeks ago.
On Saturday, it also picked some white grapes from the least affected parts of the vineyard and is planning to ferment the juice and see if smoke taint is present.
Kirkby planted his vineyard between 1998 and 2002, with his wife, Stephanie and three daughters.
The vineyard is planted with grapes including Gewurztraminer, Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier and Petit Manseng. Topper’s was also due to release a wine from a variety said to be an “Australian first” but sadly the grapes were destroyed in the fire.
After a week-long battle, firefighters eventually extinguished the Tingha Plateau on Monday (18 February).
According to preliminary figures, it burnt more than 23,400 hectares of land, destroyed 13 houses and 44 outbuildings and damaged another six houses and 13 outbuildings. No fatalities have been reported.

Scotch whisky The Dalmore has collaborated with top Italian chef Massimo Bottura, to present a one-off 49 year-old malt that will be sold to benefit charitable causes.
The Dalmore ‘L’Anima’ (‘soul’ in Italian) is a blend sourced from some of the distillery’s “most exquisite” ex-Bourbon, Sherry and Port casks to create just one, single bottle.
It is the first foray into spirits by Bottura, the chef behind Osteria Francescana in Modena.
He said: “When Master Distiller Richard Paterson and I met in Modena, it was a true meeting of the minds. Our creative processes seamlessly fused together with our passion and deep understanding of flavour complexity and connection to create a very special bottle that brings together some of the most precious scotch whisky barrels in the world.”
Bottled at 41.5% ABV, the whisky is housed in a crystal decanter featuring sterling silver stag’s head and which in turn will be presented in a handmade cabinet made from Italian olive wood, American black walnut and ebony by Scottish craftsman John Galvin.
The decanter will be offered by Sotheby’s as part of its spring online auction which runs from 25 April to 9 May.
The decanter will be offered with no reserve but Sotheby’s expects it to realise around £65,000 and the successful bidder will also be invite for a dinner for two at Osteria Francescana.
All proceeds from the sale will go towards the charity ‘Food for Soul’, a non-profit organisation founded by Bottura to help communities fight against food waste by offering meals to poor and vulnerable people around them.
Jamie Ritchie, worldwide head of Sotheby’s Wine, said: “We are excited to partner with The Dalmore and Massimo Bottura to offer this unique bottle, that only one person in the world will possess, treasure and enjoy. With the No Reserve format, we anticipate lively bidding from the moment the auction opens on 25 April and look forward to helping raise important funds for Food For Soul, with the announcement of the final price on 9 May.”

Cannabis drinks sales in the US are set to pass the $1billion mark within four years, a new report has claimed, as loosening regulation attracts greater innovation and investment.
The CBD Drinks Report, which has been launched by drinks experts Zenith Global and Beverage Digest, said US sales of cannabis-based drinks was worth $86 million last year- but sales were likely to pass the key $1 billion barrier in 2023, jumping to around $1.4 billion by 2024.
“Key growth drivers for cannabidiol [a key active component of cannabis known as CBD] drinks include loosening regulatory implementation, investment by major brewers and innovation by numerous start-ups,” Zenith global chairman Richard Hall said.
“This has led to far greater awareness and availability.”
The weed-infused drinks category has already been tipped for major success in the US as more states allow recreational use of the drug. There are now ten states, where cannabis is legal, following Michigan’s decision to legalise the drug after last year’s mid-term elections, with a further 33 states allowing medicinal use of the drug.
The rate of innovation in cannabis-infused drinks is already growing and is expected to accelerate following the passing of the Agriculture Improvement Act (Farm Bill) last December, which removed hemp (an almost identical plant that does not contain the psychoactive compound Tetrahydrocannabinol or THC) the schedule 1 of controlled substances Act. According to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center 62% of Americans, supported legalizing marijuana, rising to 74% of millennials.
Last month the Distilled Spirits Council said the growth of legalised cannabis in the US was not likely to be as harmful to the drinks industry as analysts have warned, claiming it opened up the potential for greater innovation. A number of drinks firms, including Constellation Brands, have already invested in cannabis startups and begun to develop products infused with the drug, while Carlos Brito, the chief executive of brewing giant AB InBev, said there was no concrete evidence to suggest that the US’ growing cannabis market would hurt beer sales.

Champagne Palmer & Co has unveiled its new state-of-the-art winery, located outside of Reims and close to the house’s grand and premier crus vineyards in the Montagne de Reims.
The new bioclimatic winery, designed with sustainability in mind and to maximise natural light, has a storage capacity of 21,352 hl and will house Palmer’s reserve wines. It also uses the natural slope of the land to facilitate flow by gravity.
“This new site perfectly reflects Palmer & Co’s commitment to following the path of innovation and sustainable development,” said CEO and winemaker Rémi Vervier. “Every detail has been studied in depth to ensure that the building meets the highest quality and environmental standards.”
Champagne Palmer & Co was founded in 1947 and today has 415 hectares of vineyards, comprising about forty crus, with over 200 hectares classified as Grand and Premier Crus in the Montagne de Reims.
All Palmer & Co wines are aged on the lees extensively – at least four years for the Brut Réserve, six to eight years for all vintage cuvées, and up to ten years or more for magnums and larger format bottles.

Lynne Cox, the widow of Michael Cox, a stalwart of the UK drinks trade who died five years ago, is embarking on a 188-mile walk, from Cumbria to North Yorkshire, to raise funds in his memory.
Michael Cox with his wife, Lynne
Michael Cox died on 20 February 2014, having been treated for a rare form of cancer.
He was a much-loved and prominent figure in the UK wine trade, known for being part of the Clark family that founded UK wholesaler Matthew Clark and with a grandfather who was involved in the founding of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association and the Institute of Masters of Wine.
It was however as the head of Wines of Chile (when his brother was simultaneously head of New Zealand Winegrowers UK) that he is perhaps best known and latterly as Master of the Vintners Company one of the oldest Livery companies in London – a position he saw through to the end despite his illness.
In 2013, Michael’s peers voted to award him the drinks business’ Lifetime Achievement Award, which was presented by his twin brother David.
His commitment to Chilean wine in the UK also earned him the rare honour of being made a Comendador de la Orden al Merito de Chile – a Commander of the Order of Merit of Chile – which was presented to him in the presence of the President of Chile, Sebastian Piñera in 2010.
Five years on from his death, Michael’s wife Lynne is planning a solo long distance walk in his memory, to raise funds for the Winchester Hospice Appeal.
“There is currently no hospice in Winchester, and when Michael was ill we had to travel all the way to Basingstoke to access palliative care,” she said.
“Hospices can make a huge difference to patients and their families at a difficult time and the Winchester Hospice Appeal aims to raise £3 million to convert Burrell House, in the grounds of Winchester Hospital, into a 10 bedroom hospice.
Lynne will be setting off on 10 April to complete the 188 mile Coast to Coast walk from St.Bees in Cumbria to Robin Hood’s Bay in North Yorkshire.
“I will be walking alone, carrying my own pack, and staying at B&B’s and pubs along the route. I aim to complete the walk in 13 days.”

Jackie Fast, the BBC reality show star who debuted her first wine label at the Wine & Spirits Show last year, is returning for 2019, and has tips for budding business owners in the drinks industry.
(Photo: Jackie Fast/Slingshot SponsorshipStaff Portraits)
Fast, who appeared on the 14th series of the BBC’s The Apprentice, sold her first business in 2016 and published a business book in 2017. Last year, she launched her latest venture at our inaugural Wine & Spirits Show; Rebel Pi, an icewine made from single vineyard Rousanne grown in British Columbia’s Okanagan Valley, priced at £139 a bottle.
Fast studied in Beijing before setting up her own sponsorship company, Slingshot, from her bedroom in 2010 with just a laptop and £2,000. Ultimately, her success was her downfall on the show. Lord Sugar fired her on the show because of her extensive experience in the business world.
Our Wine & Spirits Show is taking place on 12-13 April (from 2pm-9pm on 12 April and from 1pm-8pm on 13 April) at the same venue as last year, One Whitehall Place, London.
Ahead of the Wine & Spirits Show’s return, we caught up with Fast to find out what she learned from her first time on the trade side of a wine show, and the advice she has for entrepreneur who want to follow in her footsteps.
“I learnt a lot from both interaction with trade as well as consumers,” she told the drinks business. Since launching in October 2018, Rebel Pi has gone on to gain high profile listings such as with digital retailer 31Dover and Winebuyers, as well as gaining a spot on the extensive wine list at London’s Rosewood hotel, home to legendary cocktail bar Scarfe’s. The label is also expanding into Hong Kong later this year. “Not bad for our first quarter!”
Keep scrolling down to see Fast’s top tips for debuting your drinks business at a trade event.
Be nimble
 
Though there is always more room for new and innovative projects, the drinks industry is rather saturated when it comes to products, and the competition is fierce. For Fast, the Wine & Spirits Show allowed her to get “immediate feedback from consumers on everything from the packaging and bottle to the actual liquid itself.”
Being nimble and receptive to your potential customers’ feedback is absolutely essential, Fast says, to stay afloat in a crowded market.
“We took that feedback and were able to focus more specifically on our target demographic through our marketing communications.
“Being nimble is key to being able to implement the vast information gained for being an exhibitor or an attendee at a show like this.”
 
Be flexible
When you’re at a trade show, being able to read the room and adapt your selling strategy is also crucial. You might have a rough idea, but you don’t really know what your potential customers are willing to pay for until the day itself. Initially, Fast had planned to just display her premium-priced wine, but struggled to pick up interest at an event where most other wineries and distilleries were offering free samples.
“Unfortunately the price point and the complete lack of bottles makes it impossible to provide free tastings,” she said.
“However, upon many people not being happy about not giving tastings, we then sold tastings – and everyone loved that.”
Her experience from the two-day tasting has now helped inform this year’s business strategy.
“We’ll be doing a lot more sold tastings, and offering better bottle show prices for those people who love it at taste, then can get a discount on the bottle.
“We are also now able to hand deliver so we can take purchases with a show price discount on the day and have it delivered to your house the next day – so you aren’t having to carry around a bottle the entire time.”
Fast said Rebel Pi will also offer a discount for online purchases and those made on the day exclusively for Wine & Spirits Show attendees.
 
Be sociable
Working a trade show and selling to thousands of potential punters requires a real love of talking to people, but Fast said it isn’t just about selling to consumers and the trade insiders on the show floor.
“I would suggest trying to meet as many people in the industry as possible and talking about your idea to everyone,” she said.
Even at one event, if you work the room in the right way, you can really learn a lot, which is absolutely fundamental to launching a business in the world of wine or spirits.
“I also think that you need to be prepared to put in a lot of work, and be prepared for a lot of ‘nos’ before you get the ‘yes’s’.
“The drinks industry is a tough one to crack and very insular, but if you up the determination and perseverance you’ll eventually break through!”

Brancott Estate has collaborated with British artist Benjamin Craven on four limited edition labels
Keen to give its flagship Marlborough Sauvignon a fresh new look, Craven’s designs reinterpret the Marlborough landscape in his signature geometric style.
Featuring eye-poppinlgy bright colours, taking the original label as his inspiration, Craven reimagined the landscape of the New Zealand region as a series of interlocking geometric shapes.
“I wanted to bring the Brancott Estate personality to life with vibrant colours and my contemporary style.
Craven has reimagined the Marlborough landscape for Brancott’s limited edition labels
“It was about bringing the flavours of the wine and the Marlborough landscape to life in a fun, playful design but also staying true to the original label,” Craven said.
Chief winemaker, Patrick Materman, added: “Brancott is known for creating wines that are fresh, vibrant and bursting with flavour.
“It’s exciting to see how Benjamin has interpreted the wine flavours using pinks and yellows, as well as capturing the geometry and contrasting colours of our vineyards in Marlborough.”
The limited edition labels will be available in the UK from early April.
Specialising in colourful screen prints and digital patterns, Craven finds inspiration for his works in all manner of places, from the bright colours of the supermarket cleaning aisle to juxtaposing architecture.
Using clashing colours and contrasting patterns, the multimedia artist’s bold signature style is created through geometric shapes.
Craven has collaborated with the likes of Red Or Dead, Look Mate London, the Hayward Gallery and the BBC. He is currently developing his own line of homeware products. His use of bright colours and geometric shapes is reminiscent of a young David Hockney.

Champagne Louis Roederer has acquired the Merry Edwards winery in Sonoma’s Russian River Valley.
The amount paid by the French Champagne house for the 79 acre property was not disclosed.
The winery’s founder, Merry Edwards (pictured), has gained an excellent reputation for her Pinot Noirs and Sauvignon Blanc.
It is not Louis Roederer’s first purchase in the region. In 1982 it founded Roederer Estate in Anderson Valley to make sparkling wines in California and more recently acquired Scharffenberger Cellars from LVMH in 2004 and Domaine Anderson in 2012, the latter also with a Pinot Noir focus.
Roederer’s CEO, Frédéric Rouzard, told US publication Wine Spectator that the decision to purchase Merry Edwards was, “driven by confidence in her story and values” and the plan was not at all to make “millions of bottles”.
Edwards for her part told the journal that she and Rouzard had been “simpatico from the beginning” and the deal was a, “synergistic exchange”.
It was also revealed that the Roederer group recently bought a hotel at a ski resort in France.

Amcor has unveiled a new capsule system that allows for easier opening with its Easypeel capsule, while “preserving time-honoured traditions that are important to discriminating aficionados”.
Amcor’s Easypeel technology allows for a clean and consistent opening of an aluminium capsule
The Easypeel wine-opening system uses a one-piece aluminium capsule engineered to open wine bottles along a clean line, every time.
Unlike other technologies that rely on pull tabs, Easypeel allows consumers to use traditional bottle openers.
Users place the knife from an opener at a point indicated on the capsule and peel back to create a clean and consistent opening.
The improved design prevents tearing, over-cutting or removing the entire capsule, which Amcor says can “detract from the carefully crafted aesthetics wine brands work to develop”.
“We created Easypeel for everyone who loves wine,” said Nicolas Freynet, general manager, Amcor Capsules.
“From people enjoying a glass with dinner to those serving dozens of bottles daily, everyone can now cut a perfect line, every time.
“The most important beneficiaries of this innovation, however, may be the winemakers themselves.”
The system requires no design or manufacturing changes during the bottling process and offers the “elegance of tin” in an aluminium capsule at a considerably “more stable” price, says Amcor.

Bottles of Château Lafite’s 2016 vintage will feature a small hourglass etched onto the front of the bottle above the label.
The Pauillac-based first growth occasionally marks bottles from what it deems “exceptional” vintages with a symbol on the bottle.
Among the other vintages to carry a symbol are: the 2008 (with a Chinese symbol for ‘8’ in red), the 2005 (with a scale), 1999 (a sun and moon) and 1985 (a comet).
Baron Eric de Rothschild and his daughter Saskia, explained: “An hourglass has been etched onto our 2016 bottles symbolising a vintage that played hide and seek with us until the last moment. The kind you wait for, as the long summer days and the harvest go by, no one daring to breathe yet. January arrived: our doubts started to vanish. This year will be a good one.
“Today, do we still have to wait to be awed? Like a child who stares eagerly at an hourglass to announce the end of the game.
“Irony of fate, the symmetry between the two halves of an hourglass represent the opposition between earth and sky. But for this year, earth and sky joined hands. So let’s wait. 2016 deserves it.”

An online opinion poll found that more than 60% of university students within mainland China are in favour an alcohol ban on campus, following reports of deadly alcohol binge drinking in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces.
The poll, conducted by China Youth Daily, the official newspaper of Communist Youth Party, and Wenjuan.com, surveyed 1,986 university students online, and found that 65% students would be in support of an alcohol ban on campus, with 21% actively opposed to a ban.
Among the respondents, 83% said that many students drink on campus and 74.9% said that they had encountered situations in which fellow classmates were drunk, the newspaper reported.
Drinking on campus has become a much debated subject in China following a number of deadly incidents, in which one college student in Guangxi died after binge drinking, and another in southern Guangdong province died of alcohol poisoning after drinking a special concoction of cocktails mixed with six high alcohol proof spirits, the report said.
In response, a few universities introduced new rules to curb alcohol consumption on campus and even off campus.
Xi’an Translation College has now banned its students from indulging in alcohol during any festivals or gatherings and warned of discipline punishment if caught, including expulsion.
An art school in Yunnan threatened to send photos of drunk students to their parents as punishment.
The perceived interference in university life has also drawn a backlash on social media, with many calling it an ironclad control on students’ life.

A spokesperson for craft beer giant Brewdog told the drinks business the plane was “about 20 minutes from running out of beer,” while the lavatories “tapped out shortly before” the flight’s descent into Ohio. However, the company added that the passengers and crew “remained in high spirits.”
Brewdog, which opened a beer-focused hotel in the US last year, announced plans to launch an airline designed for fans who invested in the brewer’s crowdfunding campaign, Equity for Punks, in October 2018. The flight would take UK investors from London Stansted to the brewer’s US headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, where they would be able to take a tour of the stateside brewery, as well as visiting the DogHouse hotel, and a string of craft breweries based in Cincinnati.
The bespoke BrewDog Boeing 767 took off from Stansted on 21 Febuary carrying 200 investors as well as 50 members of the beer business’ team. Brewdog founders James Watt and Martin Dickie were also on-board to greet passengers, reports Lonely Planet.
The brewer also used the opportunity to debut a new beer, Flight Club; a 4.5% IPA brewed with additional citra hops to combat the flavour dulling affects the cabin pressure can have on passengers’ palates.
The maiden voyage, Brewdog said, was “suitably stocked with a wide range of awesome craft beers made at our brewery in Aberdeenshire, and our passengers came very close to drinking the plane dry! I think by the time we landed we were probably about 20 minutes from running out of beer.”
But that wasn’t the only problem the crew had to manage. Beer writer Adrian Tierney-Jones wrote on Twitter that, two hours before landing in Ohio, the lavatories became so full they had to be closed “”such was the volume of micturation.”

“The toilet system on board tapped out shortly before our descent into Ohio,” the spokesperson added, “but our passengers and the crew remained in high spirits – it didn’t spoil their experience on the world’s first craft beer airline!”

Drinks giant Constellation Brands is to sell or discontinue up to 40% of its wine and spirits portfolio in order to focus on its “power brands” that retail for over $11.
Constellation owns a number of wine brands, including New Zealand label Nobilo
As reported by Wine Enthusiast, the company’s new strategy was outlined this week at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) conference. Around 60% of Constellation’s wine and spirits portfolio is formed of “power brands” that command a retail price of over $11 a bottle.
Constellation owns The Prisoner Wine Company. The Snitch is one of its ‘power brands’ that sells for over $11
“So everything that is not a ‘power brand,’ you can assume that we’re either going to sell it, discontinue it, or milk it very quickly over the next year or so,” David Klein, Constellation’s chief financial officer, told Wine Enthusiast.
However there is one wine brand sub $11 that will be spared the chop – Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, as it’s Constellation’s top-selling wine brand.
The Mondavi brand is selling well across the board. One of its greatest recent success stories is its Bourbon barrel-aged Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon, which is now a million-case brand.
At the event, Constellation’s president, Bill Newlands, who will succeed Rob Sands as CEO on 1 March, was keen to allay investor concerns.
“We are in the process of optimising the wine and spirits business with mid-single-digit growth rates and 30%-plus operating margins. We expect to deliver at least US$4.5 billion in returns via dividends and shareholder buyback over the next three years,” he said.
Other wine brands currently in the Constellation portfolio are: Kim Crawford, The Prisoner Wine Company, Meiomi, Charles Smith Wines, Schrader, Clos du Bois and Ravenswood.
Its spirits brands include Casa Noble Tequila, Svedka vodka, Paul Masson Grande Amber brandy and Black Velvet whisky. db first reported on the rumous that Constellation was considering selling off some of its wine brands last October.

Scottish importer Inverarity Morton has taken on the UK distribution of ‘Sea Change’, a new ecologically-minded wine brand aimed at ocean conservation that has been commended by Sir David Attenborough.
Developed by 10International, the range actively supports ocean conservation with 25 euro cents from the sale of each bottle being donated to Plastic Oceans UK and Sea-Changers, two charities geared towards raising awareness of the problem of plastics in the ocean and supporting beach clean-ups and conservation efforts.
Furthermore, no plastic was used in the finished product, the bottles are lightweight to minimise emissions, the cork (Nomacorc Select Green) is made from plant based polymers and fully recyclable, no capsule covers are used to cut down on waste further still and the lables are made from a mixture of grape waste (15%) and material from FSC-certified forests.
The range was voted ‘Best Green Launch’ by the drinks business at its recent Green Awards.
The wine range itself so far comprises a red and white wine, a Chardonnay and a Negroamaro.
Toby Sigouin, wine buyer for Inverarity Morton, said: “When I first caught wind of this project, I immediately signalled it as something we wanted to back. It is such a well-considered, well-judged proposition in the face of a very real environmental crisis.
“The statistics on plastic pollution in our seas is alarming and these wines, which are excellent quality at a very affordable price point, will help stimulate both conversation and action. We intend to do justice to this great cause.”
Toby Hancock, co-founder and director of 10 International, added: “We are delighted to be working with Inverarity Morton to launch and partner with for our Sea Change project due to their engagement and commitment to the environmental message right from the start.
“The response and enthusiasm to Sea Change by the whole team has been overwhelming and this, combined with the strong distribution the company has, gives us full confidence that the brand and message will be spread far and wide.”

the drinks business and The Spirits Business are joining forces once again this year to host the Wine & Spirits Show, and now we can reveal our first exhibitors…

Our Wine & Spirits Show is taking place on 12-13 April (from 2pm-9pm on 12 April and from 1pm-8pm on 13 April) at the same venue as last year, One Whitehall Place, London.
The two-day event, open to both consumers and the trade, will bring leading wine and spirits brands together for an exciting programme of, tasting, education and debate.
Some 1,500 visitors are expected to descend on Westminster this spring, sampling everything from German craft gin to Pol Roger Champagne.
We’re also bringing back the G&T bar this year, featuring spirits from Hamburg-based distillery Knut Hansen, Pocketful of Stones – headquartered in Long Rock, near Penzance, and Scotland’s Orkney Gin Company.
While wineries will be out in force at the event, there will be something for every professional and enthusiast at the show, with a dedicated wine hall, spirits hall, beer zone and G&T bar.
Spirits
When it comes to the spirits, one of our previous partners couldn’t wait to come back for our 2nd innings.
Returning for 2019 is independent Scotch whisky producer Angus Dundee Distillers. The company owns both Tomintoul distillery on Speyside and Glencadam at Brechin, in the east of Scotland.
We also have some newcomers this year, in the form of Scottish liqueur producer Stivy’s. The Stirling-based maker has a number of vodka-based liqueurs in its portfolio including Stivy’s Kola Spirit Liqueur, Raspberry Ripple, Sticky Toffee Pudding, and Hot Banana, along with a range of ciders.
Meanwhile, Hamburg-based Knut Hansen Dry Gin will also be exhibiting at the show for the first time, giving visitors the chance to taste its gin, as well as helping our team keep the drinks flowing as one of our G&T bar suppliers.
 
Wine
Angus Dundee isn’t the only business coming back for more. Jackie Fast, the BBC’s Apprentice star who turned her hand to selling wine last year, is returning for 2019 with her Canadian icewine label, Rebel Pi.
Meanwhile, Italian wine company Casa Paladin is also showcasing its range at this year’s show. Paladin has four estates spread across Italy from Lombardy to Tuscany.
Finally, Coravin, the US-based wine tech business, is also coming back to the show in April. Its first product, the Coravin Wine Preservation Opener, was launched in 2011 and pours wine without removing the cork from the bottle.
Get in touch with Chloé Beral – chloe.beral@thedrinksbusiness.com – for more details on exhibiting at The Wine & Spirits Show.
Members of the trade will be welcome from 2-5pm on Friday. To register for the trade session, follow this link. 
The event will open to consumers from 2pm until 9pm on Friday, and 1pm until 8pm on Saturday.

A handbag made from ‘vegan’ Tuscan leather that can store and pour two different bottles of wine from an insulated pocket has gone on sale for US$89.95.

Dubbed ‘PortoVino’, the tote comes in two shades: Chardonnay (tan) and Merlot (maroon), and would make an ideal gift for the indecisive wine lover in your life.
The bag features two removable pouches in a secret insulated zippered pocket capable of holding a pair of 75cl bottles of wine.
In 2012, Cantina di Soave launched a line of boxed wine from the Veneto fashioned to look like handbags with a concealed side tap
According to its makers, the bag, which has braided handles and a soft cotton interior lining, was designed with concerts, picnics and the beach mind.
Currently on sale on Amazon and via PortoVino website, the handbag is sold with two reusable wine bladders, which its makers refer to as ‘party pouches’.
In addition to wine, the pouches can be filled with beer, spirits, water and soft drinks. The insulated pocket allegedly keeps the drinks chilled “for hours”.
For those keen to be discreet while drinking on the go, a flap at the back of the handbag hides the spouts. There’s enough spare room in the tote to house handbag essentials like wallets, phones and books.
This isn’t the first wine handbag on the market. The trend began back in 2012 with the launch of a trio of on-the-go boxed wines shaped like designer handbags.

Wines of Uruguay has appointed Gabriela Zimmer as its first brand ambassador to help promote the country’s wines abroad.
The Uruguayan-born sommelière will travel to Europe this March to present a series of masterclasses for the trade and press as well as accompany wineries at international trade fairs to help create commercial links.
The first quarter of this year will be focused on the UK – a country Zimmer knows well due to her WSET studies.
Uruguayan wines are already exported to several major international markets but Zimmer has laid out her belief that more can be done to really focus the country’s wine communication.
She believes that Uruguay needs to concentrate on creating a high value niche for itself, “small producers with excellent quality wines”, rather than aim to fight to grow huge volume share which would pit the country against the formidably well-entrenched France, Spain, Chile and Australia.
She also wants to talk about Uruguay’s principal grape, Tannat, as the South American country is almost the only wine producing nation to have made it their specialty.
Zimmer said: “Our emblematic wine grape is Tannat, Uruguay has the largest number of Tannat vineyards in the world, we are the main producer of this grape and we have a long history in the treatment of this variety, which is why the vine growers achieve fruit of excellent quality and winemakers in the winery achieve exceptional wines.”

Polpo, Russell Norman’s pioneering Venetian-inspired restaurant group, is to close two of its sites after it emerged the company owes £550,000 in unpaid tax.
Russell Norman’s Italian chain Polpo owes £550,000 to HRMC in unpaid taxes
As reported by Eater, according to a letter sent to the group’s creditors by Ellwell Watchorn & Saxton, Polpo owes HRMC £550,000 in unpaid tax.
The struggling restaurant group is seeking to close two central London sites in order to pay off its debts.
In 2017 a new management team was appointed, which, according to Eater, led to “a decline in operational standards and performance” due to the team’s lack of engagement with the day-to-day management of the business.
The letter also blames high management salaries and unprofitable investments in marketing agencies and high-speed Internet connectivity as contributing to Polpo’s debts, coupled with a decline in customer footfall.
The news follows Polpetto in Soho being put on the market for £95,000 after the departure of former head chef Anthea Stephenson after just two months.
The other ailing site is thought to be Polpo Notting Hill, which is also on sale. Founded in 2009 by Russell Norman and Richard Beatty, Polpo was one of the first places in London to champion the small plates concept outside of Spanish, Greek and Middle Eastern restaurants.
Polpo speciaises in cicchetti – Venetian tapas dishes designed to be shared. It also runs Spuntino, a counter top restaurant inspired by gritty New York diners. An offshoot of Spuntino recently opened at Heathrow T3.
The group’s model of small plates, no reservations, low-hung filament bulbs and artily distressed décor has been widely copied around London.

Broadcaster Amanda Davies co-presented the awards.
Guests, who included tennis player Boris Becker, and footballer Carles Puyolwere and Cesc Fàbregas, were welcomed with the “Hot Mexican”- a warming Patrón Añejo cocktail served in silver mugs, as well as sipping on margaritas and a bespoke serve called the Patronic (which is just Tequila and tonic, if we’re honest).
Our eyes on the inside told db that after a few drinks, Boris Becker was the last one on the dance floor having a bit of a dance off with Brian O’Driscoll. Keep up the good work, Patrón.
The Prince of Monaco was there for the awards, but for once didn’t attend the after party. Maybe he’s more of a mezcal guy.

Accolade Wines has announced the launch of a new rosé wine and gin fusion under its Echo Falls brand, adding to its growing portfolio of fruit fusion wines and vodkas aimed at a younger generation of drinkers.

Tapping into the boom in gin, Echo Falls’ 9% ABV spirit fusion is made by blending the brand’s standard rosé wine with a gin infusion and summer fruit flavours.
It follows the launch of a fruit-infused vodka in 2018, Echo Falls Summer Berries Vodka – a 37.5% ABV spirit with an RRP of between £13.50 and £16.
“Echo Falls has been a huge success story in the market, specialising in approachable, easy drinking wines that are ideally suited for those starting their journey into the category,’ said David White, marketing director at Accolade Wines.
“Our sweeter styled fruit fusion appeals to those who like the idea of wine but can find the taste challenging. We are confident that the new spirit fusion enhances the Echo Falls portfolio and also offers a new drinking occasion to those who enjoy gin.”
The Echo Falls Rosé Wine & Spirit Fusion is available at NISA and Co-op stores at an RRP of £5.

Despite having less than 2,000 hectares under vine compared to over 26,000 in Marlborough, actor-turned-winemaker Sam Neill believes planting in Central Otago is almost at capacity.
Actor Sam Neil, who owns Two Paddocks, believes vine plantings in Central Otago are almost at capacity
Speaking to db at the Central Otago Pinot Noir Celebration in Queenstown, Neill said that most of the best spots for the heartbreak grape have already been snapped up.
“I don’t think Central Otago is going to get much bigger in terms of vines in the ground as Pinot Noir is such a finicky thing and there are only a few more viable spots left in Central Otago for planting. It was apparent 20 years ago that we were going to be producing world-class wines, which has now become an actuality. It has been a gradual evolution, but in a global sense it’s been an extraordinary leap.
“It was a little scary when I planted my first vineyard in 1993, as no one knew what was going to happen. It was a big gamble but it paid off.
Neill’s first vintage of Two Paddocks Pinot was released in 1997, and a second vineyard, the Last Chance, was planted in Alexandra in 1998. In 2000 Neill planted a third vineyard – Red Bank – in Alexandra, and finally a fourth vineyard, the Fusilier in Bannockburn in 2013.

A David to Marlborough’s Goliath, there are 1,884 hectares of vines planted in Central Otago, which accounts for just 5% of all wine produced in New Zealand. Proving how white hot Central Otago is now to investors, earlier this month Mt. Difficulty was sold to US-based Foley Family Wines for NZ$52 million (£27m).
The lion’s share of plantings in the region are Pinot; a grape Neill says has brought him “heartbreak and exhilaration in equal measure”.
“We’re right on the periphery of winemaking here – Central Otago is the southernmost wine region in the world and more subject to the vagaries of weather. I’m mindful of the Old World but the beauty of making Pinot here is that we’re free of constraints and aren’t bound by the severe restrictions that the French are.
“We have four vineyards in extreme locations so we get a lot of variations between the sites. It takes nearly two hours to drive between them, and they give us different results. Vintage variation is part of the dynamics of winemaking and part of the gamble.
“You can be plunged into despair with vintages like 2000, where we made just 120 cases rather than our usual 800 due to the cold, wet weather,” Neill lamented.
On the subject of climate change, he believes Central Otago won’t witness the effects as much as other parts of the country. “I don’t think climate change will affect Central Otago dramatically for a while but other regions in NZ will be submerged one day, which is a terrifying thought,” he said.

Speaking more generally about Central Otago as a whole, Neill said the region had come of age, as both the vines and the winemakers had matured.
“Vine age has a great deal to do with the region’s evolution and we’re beginning to see the sub-regional characteristics shine through in the wines. Our oldest vines at Two Paddocks are now 26, so we’re getting more consistency, which we want, as every year brings its own characteristics. After 20 years vines really settle down.
“We’ve had some wonderful vintage in the last 10 years – 2017 will take a little time but will be an extraordinary vintage. It’s enjoyably drinkable now but will age with extraordinary grace and will be very rewarding for those who cellar it,” Neill told db.
While sommeliers and the trade are starting to take an interest in Central Otago’s different sub regions, Neill believes it’s too early to tell that story to consumers.
“I think it’s a bit too early to tell the sub-regional story in Central Otago, but it’s certainly of interest to us here. The main message we want to get out to consumers is about Central Otago Pinot and recognising what that is. I can pick out a Central Otago Pinot from a line-up from a long way off as they’re so vivid and distinctive, like Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc.
“There’s a lot of mica and schist in the soil, and we get very vivid sunshine, which has a big influence on the wines,” he said.
Neill makes less than 100 cases at a time of his single vineyard Pinot Noirs, which sell for £50 a bottle. He believes there is potential for a secondary market for Central Otago Pinot as more and more people start to “sit up and take notice of them”.

Barossa-based winery Yalumba has launched a new wine range called Samuel’s Collection, describing it as the “gateway” to its premium wine portfolio.
Speaking to the drinks business at its UK distributor’s (Fells) portfolio tasting, chairman and proprietor of Yalumba, Robert Hill-Smith said the range was named after his great, great grandfather, Samuel Smith, who founded Yalumba in 1849.
“This range is basically a nod to the heritage of our family business,” he said. “We’re aiming these wines at bars and gastro pubs where they’ll be available by the glass.
“It’s a step up and a gateway to our premium tier wines to introduce the public to what we can produce. The large producers, the likes of Yellow Tail etc, are doing nothing for the reputation of Australian wine. We want people to move up and try something different – we’re not looking to be mainstream.”
The new range comprises of a Barossa Shiraz, Barossa Shiraz/Cabernet Sauvignon, Barossa Bush Vine Grenache, Barossa Grenache/Shiraz/Mataro, Eden Valley Viognier, Eden Valley Chardonnay, and Eden Valley Roussanne.
Speaking about the Viognier, a variety that has become synonymous with Yalumba, Hill-Smith called it “highly gluggable and refreshing”.
“We’re best known for this grape – our winemaker Louise Rose has made it her life’s quest to specialise in and get to grips with it.
“The main point is its drinkability. There are lot of wines produced around the world that are high in alcohol, clumsy with lots of oak. The key to producing great Viognier is picking and having good vineyards.
“Viognier needs to be closely monitored and the grapes need to be off the wines at the right time. When the alcohol gets too high, the wine gets bitter, so getting phenols right is important too. Viognier’s aromats can come relatively late and be lost very quickly.”
He also pointed towards the range’s Grenache as being a wine that would surprise people.
“We call it the ‘blue-colour Pinot Noir”, he said. “Grenache is really underrated, particularly by Pinotphiles who especially tend to turn their noses up at it.”
“The reds in this range are medium-bodied with softer tannins – wine is a living thing not a stewing thing!”
“This range can really give you a feeling for the region and at the same time is approachable. Around the world we’re witnessing demand for wines with a bit of energy, that are easy drinking with softer tannins.”
In the press release announcing the new collection, Yalumba’s head of winemaking Louisa Rose said: “Understanding that wine drinkers are seeking more youthful, generous and fresher wines, we have crafted Samuel’s Collection to fit this style, while still showing the hallmarks expressed in the Yalumba winemaking philosophy.”
The bottles in the new collection will also be the first to feature the new Yalumba clocktower branding which will now be included across all the company’s marketing material.
Samuel’s Collection is sustainably grown and vegan-friendly, something Hill-Smith said the company had been focusing on for “over five years.”
The wines will be available in Australia and in all major export markets from 1 March 2019.

Police arrested a man in Nashville on Monday on charges of public intoxication after he tipped servers US$22,000 at a downtown hotel bar.
The inebriated individual tipped waiting staff around US$22,000
Joel Boyers, 39, attracted the attention of waiters after making several high value tips amounting to US$22,000, which had led to the serving staff competing to serve him, according to the Daily Mail.
Tennessee police were called after friends of Boyers, a pilot and flight instructor at a Tennessee flight school, sent text bragging about drinking while carrying a firearm. The high roller was arrested on charges of public intoxication.
It’s unclear if the man was aware, or had intended, to have tipped such a large sum to waiting staff, or the moral obligations of a restaurant in accepting such large tips from a clearly inebriated individual.
Last year a YouTuber, known for carrying out extreme acts of generosity, made headlines after he left a US$10,000 tip, in cash, at a restaurant in North Carolina after ordering just two waters.
Elsewhere, one waiter’s servitude was rewarded by a benevolent diner who left him a life-changing US$25,000 tip to fix his decaying teeth.

The single cask bottling, Highland Park Saltire Edition 1, and special edition Saltire Edition 2, are both 13 year old whisky’s inspired by Coulthard’s 13 Grand Prix victories.
A percentage of the proceeds from the sales of both whiskies will go towards supporting charities in Dumfries, giving back to the region that helped David during the early years of his career.
David’s Formula 1 career also inspired the design of the packaging with the saltire logo from his helmet, based upon the national flag of Scotland, featured on the label alongside his signature.
Coulthard personally selected the whiskies during a trip to Orkney.
He said: “I’ve enjoyed participating in the whisky creation process and I’m proud that Highland Park is helping me bring the project to life. The whiskies are inspired by my Formula 1 career, I had 13 Grand Prix wins and this feels like the 14th.”
Based in Kirkwall, Orkney, Highland Park distillery has been supporting the community on their island home for a number of years through charity partnerships and collaborations including the RNLI Stromness Lifeboat Anniversary Bottling and Orkneyinga Legacy Centre whisky.
Only 734 bottles of Saltire Edition 1 will be available to purchase from today (21 February) from the Highland Park website at an RRP of £139.

Newport-based craft brewer Tiny Rebel has revealed major expansion plans that will see it increase its production capacity by seven times to brew over 12 million litres of beer annually.
As reported by Wales Online, Tiny Rebel has announced plans to build a new distribution centre which will both increase its production capacity and create 25 new jobs in the area.
The brewer secured funding amounting to £175,000 from Lloyds Commercial banking as part of a total £18 billion the bank is lending to UK businesses this year.
It has now submitted plans to redevelop land opposite its current brewing headquarters on the Wern Industrial Estate.
The 30,000sqft structure will be used for storage and distribution, allowing Tiny Rebel to create room and expand production at its brewery. It is aiming to boost volumes sevenfold to reach 12 million litres a year.
This, the company predicts, will generate £10 million in turnover and increase its global reach. Tiny Rebel already exports its beers to 36 countries globally and has recently began selling to markets including Korea and Japan.
The brewery was founded in 2012 by Brad Cummings and Gaz Williams, initially operating out of a garage. Back in 2016, the brewery secured funding of £2.6m to relocate its brewery to the current site.
Tiny Rebel operates two bars in Wales as well as one at its brewery, and in July last year, teamed up with west Walian distillery Dà Mhìle to release three gins based on the flavours found in its beers.
Co-founder Brad Cummings commented: “The British craft brewing industry has exploded in recent years thanks to growing demand in both local and overseas markets.
“Our core focus remains on expanding sales across the UK, and the new distribution centre will provide us with the flexibility needed to increase production and expand our product range.“We’ve worked with Lloyds Bank since our inception in 2012. On this occasion they provided the funding to purchase the new site, but it’s the relationship teams’ constant support and guidance that has been invaluable throughout every stage of our growth.”",Leading Welsh craft brewer to increase capacity sevenfold

The latest figures from Wines of Portugal show that sales of Portuguese DO wines have seen volume and increases of over 30% in the UK in the past year.
Volume sales have risen 34% in volume from 35,883 hectolitres in 2017 to 48,092hl last year and with that came a corresponding value increase of 33.7%.
These figures make the UK the sixth biggest importer globally for Portuguese table wines and third largest if fortified are included.
That said, still wines are the main river of growth for Portugal now, the full gamut of its various grape varieties and exceptionally fair value proving a draw with both the trade and consumers.
Sonia Vieira, marketing director of ViniPortugal, commented: “The continued rise of Portuguese wine imports to the UK demonstrates their relevance across the trade, allowing buyers to meet the needs of the increasingly discerning customer, whilst remaining profitable.
“We remain committed to building recognition for these wines across the UK and confident that we can continue to drive the UK consumer’s enthusiasm for Portuguese wines.”

MPs have called for business rates to be abolished and a new tax set up for retailers that would help level the playing field against online businesses, in a radical plan to save the UK high street.
The High Streets and Town Centres report, published this morning by the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee, warned that retail on the  high street retail has reached a ‘tipping point’ and unless urgent action is taken, further deterioration, loss of visitors and dereliction may lead to some high streets and town centres “disappearing altogether”.
They said that high streets were no longer xxxx
Currently, the retail sector accounts for 5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and pays 25% of business rates, with the hospitality sector contributing 10% of the total business rates bill while representing 3% of economic activity, while pubs account for 0.5% of total rateable turnover yet paid 2.8% of total business rates. This system, it said, was unfair.
In last year’s budget, the Chancellor announced he would cut business rates by a third for up to 90% of retail properties for the next two years, and proposed a consultation proposing reforms to high street planning, as well as the Future High Streets Fund and Future High Streets Task Force – but the new report said this did not go far enough.
It suggested introducing an online sales tax, the receipts of which would offset business rates bills, a business rate ‘holiday’ from rate increases for high street retailers who have invested in and improved their property, and a reduction in business rates for retailers in high streets and town centres, which would help balance competition from out-of-town shopping centres, and a ‘green tax’ on packaging.
However, it said there were simply too much space devoted to retail on the high street to be sustained in future – footfall on the high street fell 8.1% in the first nine months of 2018 alone, the report said, while nearly 700 pubs (692) closed in the first sixth months of the year. A more proactive and coordinated measures also needed to be taken to future-proof the high street and shift the focus from the current retail-centric model, to one centred around the community, with more leisure, health and education facilities. 
Reaction
The British Beer & Pub Association (BBPA), who gave evidence to the committee welcomed some of the suggestions, with chief executive Brigid Simmonds noting that the current business rates system “penalized” pubs and other businesses for investing in their property, as improvements invariably lead to rates rises.
“The Committee’s recommendation of exploring the introduction of a 12 month ‘holiday’ on these rates increases is most welcome. This would be a positive step forward in regenerating high streets and town centres across the UK if implemented,” she said.
However she questioned whether replacing business rates for bricks and mortar businesses with a new sales tax or VAT increase would be effective or fair.
“A replacement of business rates would need to address the fact that pubs and high street businesses are unfairly taxed, whilst online retailers are not contributing enough. As the report notes, pubs alone pay 2.8% of the total business rates bill, despite accounting for just 0.5% of total rateable turnover”
UKHospitality, the new trade body for the hospitality sector following the merger of the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers (ALMR) and the British Hospitality Association (BHA), applauded the “radical” overhaul of the rates system, claiming property tax was the “chief cause” of the decline of the high street.
“In the absence of the Government’s promised full of review of business rates, this represents the most radical assessment of the state of the rates regime. This is a great starting point for opening up the conversation and beginning to address an issue that has crippled many high street businesses, not least in hospitality,” UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said.
“Supplementing rates with an online sales tax, something UKHospitality has pushed for, would provide a significant boost and the Government needs to consider this in the design of the Digital Services Tax. That tax will need to cover areas such as financial and professional services that have moved away from the high street in recent years. A new sales tax or increase in VAT for retail and hospitality would need to be pitched significantly lower than the current business rates charge to be helpful.”
“Policies to drive growth and regenerate high streets must have hospitality at their core and this needs to be recognised by the Government and local authorities,” she added.

Wine consumption may be declining in the UK, but producers from around the world are still finding success with British consumers.

Retail analyst Nielsen recently released data on the most valuable varietal wines in the UK off-trade, showing that, while wine consumption is on a downward trajectory, some varietals are still gaining value.
While Shiraz is undeniably popular, the report shows a striking increase in the value of Malbec, leap-frogging Tempranillo. The news marks a “major step for the grape which has seen such success from Argentina,” according to a statement from Concha y Toro, which was named the UK’s most popular wine label earlier this year.
In its UK Landscapes 2018 report, Wine Intelligence found that the number of people that drink wine at least once a month has fallen by one million in just three years, from 29.5 million in 2015 to 28.5 million in 2018, but this hasn’t dented sales for New World countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Chile and Argentina, which have all seen the sales value of their wines increase in the off-trade.
“The onward march of Malbec in particular has been great to see,” Simon Doyle, Concha y Toro’s general manager in the UK, said. Doyle also noted that the value of wines from Chile and Argentina, where Malbec is one of the most widely-planted grapes, is also on the rise, and now outstrips Italy’s wine sales.
“Three years ago we highlighted South America’s rapid progress up the table of the most popular wine origins, when it first overtook South Africa and then Spain when treated as a single region. It is impressive to see this upward trend persist, as shoppers continue to discover and enjoy the diverse range of wines from South America.” Argentine wine value has risen by just over 11% to £192.3 million, while Chile’s value now stands at £517.1 million, a rise of 4.1% since the previous year. Combined, the regions make up 12.6% of the UK’s total wine retail value.
We’ve listed the top six varietal reds in UK retail over the past year, according to Nielsen’s findings in the 52 weeks to 26 January 2019.
1. Shiraz

 
Total sales value last year: £337,433,000
Total sales value this year: £331,791,000
Value share percentage change: -1.7%
Shiraz is grown all over the world, and while wineries from the US to Spain sell varietals in the off-trade, its sales power in the UK comes down, at least in part, to the sheer domination of Australian wines. The report also found that wines from Australia make up around 21% of the total retail market, more than double than those from the US, which take up 10.5% of the market.

The London Wine Fair has announced exhibitor bookings are up 36% with an increase in European pavilions and the return of several important UK agencies.
The show’s organisers report that the Douro, Greece, Slovakia and the Basque Country are all taking independent pavilions for the first time, while Wines of Georgia again and ViniPortugal is bringing 36 producers all seeking UK representation – which chimes well with today’s other news that volume and value sales of Portuguese table wine have risen over 30% in the past year.
In addition, Wines of Germany has announced an increased stand presence, as has the Prosecco Consorzio.
Organisers said that the presence of so many European exhibitors signalled a continued belief in the UK market despite the continuing uncertainty over ‘Brexit’.
From the UK, Buckingham Schenk, Felix Solis Avantis and Carson Wines will all return to the fair and Ehrmanns will exhibit for the full three days for the first time since 2014.
Condor Wines, Barton Brownsdon & Sadler and Broadland Wineries have also applied for enlarged stands this year.
Head of the London Wine Fair, Hannah Tovey, commented: “So far we are seeing most of the growth in bookings coming from international exhibitors, specifically the Old World regions. We see this as really significant, given that the show will take place less than two months after Brexit may well have become reality.
“European wineries will be out in force looking to trade with the UK – many of them for the first time. Despite the uncertainty, the UK remains an important and mature market for many wineries, especially those which are targeting the high end on-trade and independent sectors.”
The LWF will take place from Monday 20 May to Wednesday 22 May at London Olympia.

Alfred Gratien is making its inaugural single vineyard Champagne from the 2018 harvest, which will be the world’s first clos expression using just the Meunier grape when its released in five years time.
The clos – a French term used to described a walled vineyard – is located close to Epernay in Cumières, and planted with “very old” Meunier, according to Alfred Gratien’s head winemaker Nicolas Jaeger.
Speaking to the drinks business in Champagne last month, he said that the quality of the Meunier was exceptional in this premier cru site, and hence his decision to buy the grapes and create a single vineyard expression.
He also told db that the fizz will become the “first clos in Champagne that is 100% Meunier”.
News of a special bottling using just this grape is surprising due to Meunier’s image as something of a workhorse grape that reliably provides a fruity edge to Champagne blends, and it is rarely used in the production of finer wines for extended ageing.
Indeed, prior to Jaeger’s decision to buy the grapes for the new Alfred Gratien Champagne, the bunches were being sent to the local cooperative, where they would have been blended with other grapes.
However, Jaeger has secured a long term contract to get the grapes from the most recent harvest as well as future vintages, having discovered the clos because both he and the owner of the vineyard were using the same babysitter.
He said that he plans to release the 100% Meunier from the clos in Cumières in five years time, “or possibly more”, and has fermented the grapes in barriques.
In keeping with all other Champagnes from Alfred Gratien, this addition to the range will not go through the malo-lactic – which is the conversion of generally sharp-tasting malic acid to the softer lactic acid.
Although Jaeger stated that his Champagne will be the first clos expression made from Meunier, as previously reported by db, Champagne Cattier has also identified a clos planted with Meunier, and has proposed releasing a Champagne from it.
Called Clos Yons, the walled vineyard is situated between Chigny-les-Roses and Rilly-la-Montagne, and represents a “specific terroir that is wonderful for Pinot Meunier,” according to former Cattier commercial director, Philippe Bienvenu.
Cattier, which makes the wines for prestige cuvée brand Armand de Brignac, had proposed using the single vineyard Meunier to make a special release from the top-end Brignac brand, which is famous for its Ace of Spades emblem and backing from American rapper Jay-Z.
However, db has since learned that such a Champagne is unlikely to be released under the Armand de Brignac marque.
In the meantime, Gosset, which is the oldest wine-producer in Champagne, has given Champagne’s workhorse grape a prestige positioning with the launch of a £90 fizz that’s made entirely from Meunier – a first for a Grande Marque.
Called Grand Blanc de Meunier, the Champagne was released in London in September last year.
With as many as 10 years ageing in bottle in Gosset’s cellars, the Champagne house is attempting to debunk a widespread belief that Meunier doesn’t produce long-lived fizz.
Like the Alfred Gratien Meunier, Gosset’s expression does not go through the malo-lactic conversion, which may be an important aspect to ensuring the grape can be used to produced a long-lived Champagne because malic acid is said to enhance the wine’s ageing capacity.
With the majority of Meunier planted in the Marne Valley – where the grape accounts for over 60% of all productive vines – it is generally tied to lower-lying, damper sites that are less conducive to high quality red grapes compared to the celebrated slopes of the Montagne de Reims, home to grand cru villages such as Verzenay, Ambonnay and Bouzy.
Meunier, which is a clonal variation of Pinot Noir, is favoured in the Marne Valley because the variety buds later than Pinot Noir – and ripens earlier – making it a more reliable performer in terms of yield in this frost-prone part of Champagne.
However, Meunier produces its best results in the crus of Champagne, particular around Epernay, where it can be found mixed among Pinot Noir vines.
While Gosset may be the first Grande Marque to release a pure Meunier Champagne, and Alfred Gratien the first to create a clos expression, there are several other producers, particularly growers, who make a fizz with just this grape.
As previously reported by db, Champagne Jean Moutardier has found success with a its Cuvée Pure Meunier – a brut nature fizz using only this grape – that was launched in 2004.
As for growers who bottle 100% Meunier Champagnes, celebrated examples come from names such as Egly-Ouriet, Jérôme Prévost, and Laherte Frères.
It is also important to note that Krug is an advocate of the quality potential of Meunier from old vines in good sites, regularly using the grape in its blends.
For example, more than one fifth of the wines in Krug’s celebrated 2002 vintage release were made from the Meunier grape.
There are fewer than 40 clos in Champagne, with just a handful with true global renown, such as Champagne Philipponnat’s Clos des Goisses, or Krug’s Clos de Mesnil and newer Pinot-only expression, Clos d’Ambonnay.
Relatively recent additions to the world of clos bottlings in Champagne include Pommery’s Clos Pomadour – launched in 2011 with the 2002 vintage – and Clos Lanson, first made from a walled vineyard in Reims using Chardonnay from the 2006 harvest, and launched in early 2016.

Cleverly targeting aspirational millennial women, new wine brand JNSQ has launched a rosé in a French glass bottle inspired by vintage perfume bottles.
American firm The Wonderful Company has launched a new wine brand called JNSQ aimed at aspirational millennial women
As reported by Adweek, JNSQ – standing for ‘Je Ne Sais Quois’ – is the brainchild of The Wonderful Company, which also owns water brand Fiji and California winery Justin Vineyards.
The JNSQ range, which includes a Grenache-based rosé and a Sauvignon Blanc made from grapes grown in California’s Central Coast, went from an idea to a reality in less than a year.
Unusually for a wine brand, the bottle was the key focus, and the idea of the brand was built around it. The aim was to create a bottle inspired by vintage perfume vessels that drinkers would want to keep and re-use as a vase or perfume holder.

Created by a French glass manufacturer, the round bottle has a re-sealable glass stopper fashioned into a white rose, and no label, just a simple ‘JNSQ Rosé Cru’ printed onto the glass.
Priced at $29 (£22) a bottle, the wine inside is said to be “refreshing and balanced with notes of strawberry, cherry and white flowers”.
The Sauvignon Blanc meanwhile, costs the same as the rosé, and boasts a re-sealable round glass stopper. According to its makers, the wine is “crisp and bright with notes of apple, lemon and tropical fruit”.
“We wanted to make sure the bottle stood out on the shelf and stood out to our audience. I’m shocked that we were able to sell it for $29, because we’ve never been shy about putting our money into packaging, and it feels like a much more expensive bottle of wine,” Wonderful Agency’s CCO, Darren Moran, told Adweek.
The Wonderful Company chose to launch JNSQ in time for Valentine’s Day. To help raise awareness of the brand, it sent out 50 bottles to celebrity influencers in a gift set packaged to look like a vintage hat box.

“Millennial women are bringing back an appreciation for quality, craftsmanship and functional beauty. JNSQ was created specifically for these women and the milestones they are celebrating in their exhilarating lives,” said The Wonderful Company’s co-owner, Lynda Resnick.
The Wonderful Company is harnessing the power of the fashion industry to help launch the brand, which was on pour at California designers Kate and Laura Mulleavy of Rodarte’s Autumn/Winter 2019 show in Los Angeles this month.
The ad campaign for the brand centres around the nostalgia of luxury travel in the ‘50s and ‘60s. Shot by a fashion photographer, among the images in the campaign is one of a woman in an Audrey Hepburn-inspired black dress and pearls sipping rosé in a vintage train carriage evocative of the Orient Express.
In another, a lady in a vintage yellow swimsuit and retro round sunglasses sips Sauvignon on the bonnet of a classic car from the 1950s. The adverts, which, among other places, will appear on a billboard in New York’s Times Square, run with the tagline ‘She’s got that… JNSQ’.
The brand is already selling three times as much wine as the other two wine estates in The Wonderful Company’s portfolio.

The man identified only by his surname, Chu, collapsed and died after his final broadcast on 31 December following a live steaming session of him drinking alcohol in a supermarket in the port city Dalian on the Chinese snapchat-like app Liaoliao, Chinese media The Paper reported this week.
In old video clips, Chu was seen drinking gallons of alcohol and at one time even cooking oil for viewers and fans in order to generate clicks and cash rewards from them.
In some Chinese live streaming platforms, streamers are rewarded with virtual gifts and cash if the content of the video is entertaining and eye-catching, leading many to go to extremes.
In one video, Chu was seen twitching and told his viewers he couldn’t drink any more but was encouraged to go on. Other clips showed him passing out after heavy drinking and vomiting on the ground, according to the Chinese report. Sessions like this would bring in about RMB 500 (US$75) a day.
A friend close of Chu told The Paper: “He has been drinking for three months. Within that time, he was drinking alcohol, beverages, cooking oil and beer. He never stopped.”
Another man called Wang who lent Chu the live streaming rooms felt he was partly responsible for his death, when interviewed.
“Of course, I have responsibility,” he said. “After all, he did the broadcasting in my room. I have responsibility but I was only assisting him and did not force him. He’s someone who knew what he was doing. The primary party responsible for this should be the [live-streaming] platform,” he said.
The Wuhan-based Liaoliao app has been shut down and blacklisted by Wuhan authorities.
Content on the app included drinking, gambling and other “inappropriate” broadcasting material, the report said.

US retailer Total Wines & More has lost an appeal to overturn a minimum price law in Connecticut, after a court ruled in favour of the US state’s booze laws.
The US second circuit ruled in favour of Conneticut’s current alcohol pricing laws, saying they did not violate anti-trust laws set down by the 1890  Sherman Act.
The national retailer, which is one of the US’s largest specialist drinks retailers, launched the case in 2016, challenging the state over its setting of minimum prices on booze, which requires wholesalers to publish bottle prices each month – to allow smaller retailers to keep prices in line with larger retailers – and bans them from offering discounts for higher volume purchases.
According to a report published in legal journal Law360, the retailer argued that the state’s restrictions ‘discouraged competition and kept prices “substantially above what fair and ordinary market forces would dictate” if wholesalers were free to set their own prices’, discouraging any wholesaler from being the first to break ranks and thereby ensuring vertical price-fixing between wholesalers.
It further argued that retail prices for wine and spirits in Connecticut were as much as 24% higher than prices offered for identical products in surrounding states, according to court documents quoted by legal newsite, CourthouseNews. 
But while the 45-page precedential ruling found that the Connecticut Liquor Control Act’s requirements was a restriction on trade, it was not a violation of the Sherman Act, Law360 reported.
Following the decision, the retailer, which operates stores in 21 different states including four stores in Conneticut, could take its case to the High Court.
It is already involved in a potential landmark case being heard by the High Court. It has challenged the state of Tennessee over the state’s strict residency requirement in which anyone applying for an initial alcohol licence must have been a resident in Tennessee for two years and in order to renew that initial one-year license, they must have been a resident in the state for ten consecutive years.
The case, which has also been brought by Doug and Mary Ketchum of Kimbrough Wine and Spirits, is being backed by the National Association of Wine Retailers and others, including a group of 81 consumers, versus a group of existing retailers in the state who want to retain the status quo.
Total Wine & More, who want to open a stores in the state, argues that the residency requirement is discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional, but the case may have wider implications for interstate wine sales.

The Institute of Masters of Wine has announced six new Masters of Wine, from six different countries, taking the total number of people to hold the title worldwide to 384.
The new Masters of Wine are Edouard Baijot MW (France), Nicholas Jackson MW (USA), Brendan Jansen MW (Australia), Jonas Röjerman MW (Sweden), Harriet Tindal MW (Ireland) and Jonas Tofterup MW (Spain).
The new members of the IMW have proved their understanding of all aspects of wine by passing the Master of Wine examination, recognised worldwide for its rigour and high standards.
The MW examination consists of three stages and culminates in the submission of a final research paper, an in-depth study on a wine-related topic from any area of the sciences, arts, humanities, or social sciences.
In addition to passing the examination, all MWs are required to sign the MW code of conduct before they are entitled to use the initials MW. The code of conduct requires MWs to act with honesty and integrity and to use every opportunity to share their understanding of wine with others.
There are now 384 MWs in the world, based in 30 countries. The new MWs will be formally welcomed to the IMW at a ceremony in London later this year.

Johnnie Walker has launched the latest edition of its ‘Blue Label Ghost’ expression, using malt from ‘ghost’ distillery Port Ellen, in Singapore.
The whisky is the second in a range that draws on stocks of rare malts at closed distilleries in the Johnnie Walker portfolio. The previous edition used whiskies from another closed distillery, Brora.
Master blender, Jim Beveridge, said: “These whiskies deliver a fascinating glimpse into another world, exploring the unique, inimitable character of whiskies from a small number of iconic, closed distilleries that lend something very special to every drop of Johnnie Walker Blue Label. It’s really interesting to be able to put a spotlight on the character of these whiskies.”
Although currently a closed distillery, Johnnie Walker’s brand owner, Diageo, announced plans in 2017 to restore and reopen both Brora and Port Ellen in 2020.
The Blue Label Ghost uses whiskies from Caledonian and Carsebridge for what Beveridge called, “layers of creamy, vanilla sweetness”, while malts from Mortlach, Dailuaine, Cragganmore, Blair Athol and Oban add, “rolling waves of waxy citrus, rich malt and tropical fruit flavours” but the Port Ellen ties it all together with, “distinctive maritime smokiness…that lingers in the long and warming finish.”
Bottled at 43.8% ABV, each bottle is individually numbered. Available at all 1855 Bottle Shops and specialist stores across Singapore priced at S$518 per bottle.

Direct French wine and spirits exports to mainland China dropped 14.4% in value last year amid the country’s economic slowdown and trade frictions with the US, but French exports to Hong Kong remain strong.
According to the latest figures released by The Federation for Wine and Spirit Exporters (FEVS), direct sales to mainland China, France’s third biggest export market after Europe and the US, dipped by 14.4% to €1 billion in 2018.
However, the trade association noted that the decline was partly compensated by imports from Hong Kong and Singapore.
Antoine Leccia, president of FEVS, commented, “the Chinese market is largely supplied via Hong‐Kong and Singapore, which is not accurately reflected by export figures. At €2.5 billion, 2018 is the second‐best year for French wines and spirits exported to China / Hong Kong / Singapore, confirming the long‐term dynamics of the Chinese market.”
The rest of Asia excluding the aforementioned is “growing strongly” said the trade organisation with sales of French wine close to €1 billion, up 4.7%.
According to Chinese customs figures, China’s wine imports by volume dropped by 8.95% and value levelled out with a 1.1% increase with the main importing countries, including France, Australia, Spain and Italy all seeing drops in value with the exception of Chile, as dbHK reported earlier.
Other than China, French wines turnover in the EU increased for the second year in a row by 2.2% to €4.5 billion. The US continues to grow at a steady pace, with exports up 4.6% year‐on‐year to €3.2 billion.
Overall, French wine and spirits exports crossed the threshold of €13 billion in 2018 for the first time to €13.2 billion with €8.9 billion for wine and €4.3 billion for spirits.

he travellers forced their way into the brewery site in Blackburn over the May bank holiday last year and prevented staff from entering the premise.
Despite requests to move on by Thwaites’ security, the group refused and evicted a guard from the site.
Whilst being asked to leave on the Saturday (26 May) and the following day (Sunday 27 May), Thomas Ward, referring to himself as “Big John” and “Big Dave”, tried to blackmail two Thwaites employees, demanding £20,000 or “the place is ours.”
Later that day (Sunday 27 May), the travellers occupying the area allowed some Thwaites staff on to the site for around an hour and a half so they could remove personal items, sensitive documents and valuable equipment including computers. At that time, nothing had been damaged but unfortunately the workers were not able to remove everything of value.
At some point after this visit, some of the group – lead by the Wards and a 17-year-old boy – looted office buildings, stealing televisions, computer equipment, high value alcohol and electrical copper wiring from throughout the entire site. The group also damaged vehicles, used the brewery’s offices as toilets, smashed windows, stole items and set off fire extinguishers.
The travellers remained at the site until they were moved on by police escort on 28 May 2018, the Bank Holiday Monday.
After regaining control of the site, staff at Thwaites were forced to pour away around 1,700 pints of beer due to fears it could be contaminated.
Yesterday, two men were jailed for their part in the carnage. Thomas Ward, 44, of Aspull Common, Leigh was sentenced to four years and three months in prison after previously pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary, conspiracy to commit criminal damage and blackmail.
John Ward, 34, of Aspull Common, Leigh was handed a sentence of three years and nine months after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to commit criminal damage, also at an earlier hearing.
Patrick Ward, 32, of Aspull Common, Leigh, was found guilty of conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to commit criminal damage in his absence in November last year. He is still outstanding and is wanted by police.
A fourth person – a 17 year old boy who pleaded guilty to the same charges – has been bailed to appear at youth court for sentencing at a later date.

Speaking after court, Superintendent Andrea Barrow from Blackburn Police said: “When Thwaites’ staff entered their place of work on Monday 28 May, they were met with scenes of utter devastation. Not only had lots of equipment and alcohol been stolen, the power had been cut, windows had been smashed, office furniture damaged, food had been thrown over floors and a water cooler had been tipped over causing flooding. Employee’s personal possessions had literally been scattered around and 1,700 pints of beer had to be thrown away.
“It was extremely upsetting for Thwaites staff who had had been due to end over 200 years of brewing at this particular site around 12 weeks later, however, they had to make the tough decision to not brew there again, such was the risk of contamination.
“The behaviour of all the people involved in the damage and destruction was utterly deplorable. Thomas Ward not only had the audacity to force employees off company property, he then tried to coerce them into paying thousands of pounds for the travellers to leave. Thankfully no money was handed over in spite of his demands.”
She added: “We generally have good relationships with the travelling community and the level of destruction and damage caused to the site is not reflective of the behaviour of all Travellers.
“We know other people were involved who haven’t yet appeared before the courts and so our investigation continues to ensure we trace them and bring them to justice also.”

Brains Brewery has been fined £140,000 after a customer fell through an unlocked cellar door and fractured his skull, leaving him with serious head injuries.
The victim, who has not been named, was in the Park pub in Barry, Wales, last February when the door was left open for cleaning staff and he plunged down a concrete flight of stairs. 
He was knocked unconscious and suffered a fractured skull and bleed on the brain. The man is still receiving treatment for issues connected to the incident.
A case was brought against the brewery by the Vale of Glamorgan Council, together with Bridgend and Cardiff councils. The brewery pleaded guilty to one offence under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 for failing to ensure the health and safety of a non-employee.
At a hearing in Cardiff Magistrates Court, SA Brains was fined £140,000, ordered to pay costs of £11,835.48 and a victim surcharge of £170.
Councillor Hunter Jarvie, Vale of Glamorgan Council Cabinet member for Legal and Regulatory Services, said: “This was a grave mistake that led to an individual suffering significant, long-lasting injuries.
“As a Council, we take our duty of care to the public extremely seriously and will continue to pursue companies that do not adhere properly to health and safety legislation. “Hopefully this sends out a message that such legislation must be followed rigorously and that there are severe consequences if it is not.”

Champagne de Venoge has launched a new cuvée to celebrate the 130th anniversary of the opening of the Eiffel Tower in 1889.
Champagne de Venoge was a partner of The Exposition Universelle of 1889, for which the Eiffel Tower was constructed
Called the Tour Eiffel Cuvée, president of Champagne de Venoge, Gilles de la Bassetière, told the drinks business in Epernay last month that he had been inspired to create the label for two main reasons.
The first of these relates to the fact that de Venoge was a Champagne partner of The Exposition Universelle of 1889, for which the Eiffel Tower was constructed, and the second concerns the issue that the Champagne brand’s ‘Princes’ expression has a bottle shape resembling the tower’s striking geometry.
For this latter reason, Gilles has chosen to use wines normally reserved for the Princes Champagne by de Venoge to make the Tour Eiffel Cuvée.
Just 10-15,000 bottles have been produced of the Champagne, which comprises equal parts of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Meunier using a base vintage of 2013, and a dosage of 6.1 g/l.
Costing around €70, it will available only in Nicolas stores in France from late March until the end of May, and in Parisian restaurants from April.
For later in the year, the cuvée will be available in all markets, and Gilles hopes to make the Tour Eiffel Cuvée a permanent addition to the range of Champagnes from de Venoge.
Commenting that he had wanted to create such a cuvée for a long time, he said that it had been extremely hard getting a licence from the Ville de Paris – which owns the tower – to use the name and imagery of the famous monument.
Acknowledging that Pommery has already created a Champagne bearing the symbol (pictured below), he said that he was sure he was the first to be granted a licence from the city to create a cuvée based around the tower.
Pommery Pop Tour Eiffel Brut is believed to have been created in partnership with the Eiffel family
Indeed, it is believed that the Pommery Pop Tour Eiffel Brut was created in partnership with the Eiffel family, rather than the city of Paris.

A woman has died and 28 others suffered food poisoning after dining at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Valencia.
It’s been suggested that a batch of poisonous mushrooms (not pictured) may have been to blame.
The 46-year-old woman, who has not been named, became ill after having a meal at the Riff restaurant in Valencia with her husband and son. She died in the early hours of Sunday. Her husband and son were also taken ill, but are said to be recovering, according to reports by The Guardian. 
Health authorities have so far tracked down 75 people who ate at Riff between 13 and 16 February, and have confirmed a total of 29 cases of food poisoning.
With the exception of the person who died, all those who fell ill have shown light symptoms – mainly vomiting,” the regional health authority said in a statement on Thursday.
Food safety officers visited the restaurant on 18 February and failed to find any obvious explanation for the poisonings, although it has been reported that a poisonous mushroom could have been to blame, as reported by The Telegraph, but this has not been confirmed by authorities.
Samples of dishes served as a part of a tasting menu are being analysed by the National Toxicology Institute.
Bernd H Knöller, the head chef and owner of Riff, which has a Michelin star, is working with the regional health authorities, and has closed the restaurant while an investigation is completed.
He said: “I’ve taken the decision to close the restaurant until we know the precise causes and can reopen with the necessary guarantees for the safety of both staff and customers.”

Listed for sale on California Outdoor Properties, the appellation covers 150 acres, with 55 acres under vine. It is planted with varieties including Cabernet Sauvignon (26.5 acres), Riesling (11.5 acres), Pinot Noir (10.2 acres) and Merlot (7 acres).
According to the listing, around 130 tons of grapes a year are sold to nearby wineries. The sale also includes a building site on a knoll overlooking the vineyards, a property for a vineyard manager, private septic system, overhead electric cables and an “abundant water supply” which includes rights to a reservoir.
Cole Ranch is located in a remote, oak-lined valley, around 1,400 feet above sea level, and is two hours by car from San Francisco.
Ohio-born John Cole planted the first vines in the area in the 1970s, with Cole Ranch officially recognised as an American Viticultural Area in 1983.
With its own mesoclimate, Cole Ranch is wetter and cooler than neighbouring appellations, with wines produced in the area noted for their crisp acidity.
Speaking to SF Gate, Todd Renfrew of California Outdoor Properties, said: “The best thing about this property is the water rights.
He explained that while the reservoir, which used to be part of Cole Ranch, had been sold off, the water rights remained.
Commenting on the work of the previous owners, he added: “They’ve fixed it up and cleaned it up, and now it’s ready for someone already in the wine industry or someone who wants to get into it.”

Glenfiddich owner William Grant & Sons has launched its sixth Ian Murray Scholarship which offers support to young people in the off-trade spirits sector.
Ian Murray, who the scholarship commemorates
First launched in 2014 in honour of the late Ian Murray, William Grant’s former prestige retail manager, the scholarship is open to young people between 18 and 30.
Applicants are shortlisted by Ian Murray’s colleagues and the Grant family before the chosen candidate commences a bespoke 12-month programme comprising of WSET Level 2 training, a presentation skills course, an educational distillery visit, and expert development of the spirits category with a particular focus on malt whisky.
An independent family-owned company founded in 1887 by William Grant with the ambition to make the ‘best dram in the valley,’ William Grant and Sons Ltd’s portfolio features some of the world’s leading brands of Scotch whisky, including Glenfiddich and The Balvenie range of single malts alongside spirits brands such as Hendrick’s Gin, Sailor Jerry and Milagro Tequila.
Anna Rogan of Luvians Bottleshop in St Andrews was the recipient of the 2018 Ian Murray scholarship, as reported by db‘s Phoebe French.
Rogan said: “The skills I have gained in the past year have been invaluable in every aspect. The WSET and Presentation Skills courses have vastly improved both my knowledge and confidence, whether I’m leading a tasting or just chatting to a fellow whisky lover!
“I also loved having the chance to meet Ian’s wife Jill, touring Glenfiddich with her and hearing stories about Ian and his adventures in whisky – I’m hugely grateful for the experience.”
The 2019 scholarship was symbolically launched on Ian Murray’s birthday, the 15 February.

Portuguese restaurant Londrino is expected to close later this month, barely a year after opening, with its head chef Leandro Carreira said to be moving onto a new project.
Londrino’s signature octopus with red pepper miso and kohlrabi
Located on Snowfields in London Bridge, Londrino serves an ever-evolving menu of sharing plates that interpret Portuguese cuisine through a London lens, including bowls of Madeira-laced red prawns and ‘toffee’ mayo with spears of white and green asparagus.
One of its best known dishes is octopus with red pepper miso and kohlrabi (pictured). However, as reported by Eater, the restaurant is expected to serve its last plates on 28 February.
Carreira cut his teeth in Lisbon before moving to the two Michelin star Mugaritz in the Basque Country to work under Andoni Aduriz.
Moving to London, Carreira went on to become head chef at Nuno Mendes’ experimental modern Portuguese restaurant, Viajante, at the Town Hall Hotel in Bethnal Green, and later worked at hipster foodie favourite Lyle’s in Shoreditch.
His debut restaurant was one of the most hotly anticipated restaurant openings of 2018.
Londrino’s wine list was also highly prized, with our Wine List Confidential editor Douglas Blyde praising its sommelier/manager, Cameron Dewar, who curated a detailed list of ‘organically farmed, biodynamic or minimal intervention, low-to-no added sulphur’ wines bringing “added sapidity to Londrino’s impeccably fresh fare”.
The reason for its closure is not clear, however Eater reports that Carrerira already has his next venture lined up.

Budget Malaysian airline Air Asia is to open a restaurant showcasing the dishes listed on its in-flight menu called Santan, including chicken teriyaki, Pak Nasser’s Nasi Lemak and a vegetable rice bowl.
While food served on-board aeroplanes is often the butt of jokes, Air Asia believes its offering will stand up to scrutiny. The low-cost airline believes its in-flight menu is so good, it deserves the right to be served in a restaurant.
During an interview on radio talk show Larry King Now, Tony Fernandes, CEO of Air Asia Group said: “We believe in it so much that we’re going to start a fast-food restaurant out of it. It’s called Santan.”
However, Fernandes did not say when the restaurant would be operational, nor where it would be located. There has also been no official statement from the airline.
Santan, the Malay word for coconut milk, is also the name of the airline’s in-flight menu which launched in 2015. Other dishes served on-board include mapo tofu, pumpkin kootu and vegetable jalfrezi, kung pao chicken and kimchi beef fried rice.
Last month, Air Asia launched a “farm-to-air dining experience” as part of its Santan menu. A play on the popular farm-to-table movement, the airline will be serving up meals using seasonal ingredients “directly sourced from farmers across the country”.
Dishes include the chipotle chicken wrap, caesar salad, California crab onigiri and Korean beef stew.
AirAsia Philippines CEO captain Dexter Comendador commented: “Santan came about in 2015 as a tribute to ASEAN flavours, and here we are four years after, welcoming this year with a concept that is both good for the heart and nourishing for the soul. We are promoting healthy eating and helping Filipino farmers at the same time.”

Southern French wine estate Paul Mas has added Montagnac-based Domaine les Verrieres to its portfolio with a view to bolstering its premium “Astelia” bottle range.

Housed within the languedoc AOP, Domaine les Verrieres is spread across over 22 hectares and is planted mainly with Syrah, with some Grenache Noir and Carignan vineyards.
Paul Mas, which now has 15 estates within its portfolio, will use the plantings to produce two blended wines, Les 7 Fontaines and Clos de Soutyères which are now available in the UK.
These will be followed by Les Pierres Plantées, a predominantly Syrah which will be offered in the ‘Astelia’ bottle design reserved for Paul Mas’ premium cuvées.
Les Verrieres is made up of small plots with clay and limestone soils that experience cool nights, daytime heat and strong winds, providing a “ideal climactic conditions”.
“The Syrah and Grenache vineyards are between 20 and 30 years old; certain plots of Carignan are over 40 years old and there is even a 60 year old parcel of Cinsault,” said owner Jean-Claude Mas.”
“The yields here are low, with traditional vinification where we alternate pumping over with punching down, and using long macerations.
“As ever, with estates which we take into our portfolio, the emphasis is with working with the existing attributes of the Domaine, and simply adding the Paul Mas approach to it.”
Paul Mas, which was first established in 2000, now counts 15 estates within its portfolio in the south of France.

A Swiss wine buyer visiting Australia was allegedly charged AUS$8,000 (£4,386) in corkage, having brought eight bottles of his own wine to a restaurant in Melbourne.
The man was allegedly charged AUS$8,000 corkage on eight bottles of wine.
As reported by the Daily Mail, each of the eight bottles he brought with him cost just $200, but he was charged a fee of $1,000 (£548) a bottle, costing a total of $8,000.
At AU$1,000 a bottle corkage, it would likely be the priciest corkage charge of any restaurant in the world.
Chef Tom Keller’s restaurants, Napa’s French Laundry and New York’s Per Se, are often touted the world’s most expensive for corkage. But at just US$150 (£114) a bottle, its charges seem reasonable by comparison.
Joël Robuchon in Las Vegas charges $100 a bottle and the Shangri-La hotel at London’s tallest building, the Shard charges pay £50 ($83.95) per 750ml bottle of still wine and £75 ($125.90) for a bottle of Champagne.
The wine buyer said he had attempted to contact the high end restaurant three times to confirm if he could bring his own wine and the relevant charges, but had received no response.
The story was reported by an Australian radio station, after a man believed to be a client of the wine buyer, known only as Scott, got in touch to share the story.
The name of the restaurant, which is reported to be in Melbourne, has not been revealed.

Following the success of his acclaimed restaurant Silo in Brighton, owner and head chef Doug McMaster is set to open a new venue at Crate Brewery in Hackney Wick.
Silo’s current site in Brighton will be retained with the new Hackney-based restaurant opening as a new operation.
The move is reliant on the success of a £500,000 crowdfunding campaign from craft brewers Crate Brewery in Hackney Wick.
Launched in 2014, Silo in Brighton followed the success of McMaster’s Melbourne restaurant in collaboration with sustainable artist and architect Joost Bakker.
Sustainable practices at McMaster’s Brighton restaurant include recycling the venue’s glass and using the sand to make ceramics for the restaurant.
Silo’s menu offers an à la carte lunch and brunch with a tasting menu for dinner, and vegetarian and vegan options on offer. Previously dividing the menu between plant-based and omnivorous dishes, Silo has since simplified this to one menu.
The current menu features a mackerel tartare with purple daikon and miso, a pink fir potato with sea kale and chestnut, and pollock with negi onion and crab emulsion. The desserts include a pumpkin seed ice-cream with fig leaf and furikake.
The wine list consists of natural wines, predominantly from European producers, alongside house craft ale and a selection of cocktails.
Silo is set to open in July, with crowdfunding launching on 28 February. Crate is raising money to help fund the refurbishment its current home. The money will also allow it to install a new pilot brewery, increase its outdoor seating area and install Silo at its premises.
If the campaign is a success, Silo will be based upstairs in the main white building. McMaster and the Crate team are also planning a series of workshops and talks in a new space next to the restaurant.

Six chefs from Michelin-starred restaurants have raised more than £70,000 for the charity Debra, after giving up their time to host a Great Chefs Dinner in London.

The event, which took place at luxury hotel The Langham’s Roux at the Landau on the 4 February, saw chefs Michel Roux Jr, Andrew Wong, Mark Flanagan, Chris King, Gianluca Fusto and Andrew Gravett donate their culinary skills to the fundraiser.
DEBRA, the only national charity in the UK to support people with Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), a potentially fatal skin condition, was founded in 1978 by Phyllis Hilton whose daughter suffered from EB. The charity funds innovative research into finding effective treatments and a cure for the condition.
The black-tie event began with canapés and a Champagne reception sponsored by Dumangin Fils followed by four courses, with each chef responsible for one part of the menu created in honour of the occasion.
Paired with wines sponsored by Kent producer Chapel Down, the menu featured a starter of Sandringham game “Pate en Croute” with pickled mushroom salad and roasted shallots followed by an intermediate dish of seared scallop cheung fun with gai lan and fermented, chilli bean vinaigrette, crispy Cantonese pork belly, honey mustard and liquorice soy. The main course was a Quail and foie gras ‘lucullus’ with Jerusalem artichoke, pear and black truffle.  Petit fours were served for dessert.
The dinner was followed by a culinary-themed auction and an opportunity to meet the chefs.
Guests included Olympic silver medallist and the Queen’s granddaughter Zara Tindall, nee Phillips, and her husband, former England Rugby captain Mike Tindall.
Addressing the guests during the dinner, DEBRA president Simon Weston CBE gave an insight into the pain and suffering people with EB experience and thanked the chefs for their involvement. Weston, a Falklands war veteran who survived the 1982 bombing of RAF Sir Galahad, sustained burns on 46% of his body and had to endure ninety-eight operations.
Weston said: “I am delighted that we were able to raise over £70,000 from the Great Chefs Dinner, the meal from the world class chefs was superb and the wine was perfect!  We are very appreciative of the chefs’ support, it is phenomenal that they gave up their valuable time to help us fight EB and raise the profile of the condition.”
Receiving no government funding, DEBRA relies on donations to carry out its work and continue its battle against EB.
Priced at £340 per person, all of the proceeds from the The Great Chefs Dinner will contribute to funding specialist EB nurses who provide vital care across the country.
The charity’s next fundraiser, the DEBRA Butterfly Ball, will take place on the 14 June at Kensington’s Royal Garden Hotel, where Pollen Street Social’s Jason Atherton will join forces with La Tante Claire’s three Michelin star chef Pierre Koffman. Priced at £195, tickets can be bought here.

Specialist UK retailer Majestic Wine has confirmed to db it is trialing a new ‘merchandising by taste’ strategy, that allows customers to find the wine styles best suited to them online, and trial them in store. 
The retailed told db the new ‘Take my Wine Fitting’ section on its website, which is still being trialed and has yet to be widely marketed to its subscribers, is part of a “joined-up” strategy for its website, email marketing and in-store merchandising.
The initial launch is being linked to the Majestic Awards to find the most retailer’s most popular bottle of wine.
“We have recently merchandised wines by different stylistic categories in a section on the website,” a Majestic spokesman told db.
“We are encouraging customers to explore these styles with an invite to come in taste four examples blind – it’s a joining up of website category, email marketing and then a tasting element in store. Customers can then vote for their favourite in each category through their email or in-store.”
Customers are invited to take a simple online test online to discover their wine profile, which produces a ‘top pick’ of styles best suited to the customer, colour-coded to help them navigate wines more easily, along with four suggestions for each style. It is also offering £9.99 off, when you buy a case of six.
It’s marketing claims that it will make customers “in-store and online experience…. curated just for your tastes”.
According to the retailer, the ‘Wine Fitting from Majestic’ was developed in house, and although still at an early stage of development, helps customers discover “the best wines they’ve never tasted”.

“Your wine profile is based on 35 years of understanding how we all buy wine, and it’s actually very simple…  all there is to know is will YOU like the taste? Not the grape, not the country, not the award, not the expert’s opinion, nor the label. Your taste buds are king!” its marketing says.
The trial follows a trial of a ‘palate fitting’ station at its pop-up store at last June’s Taste of London, which allowed visitors to ‘calibrate’ their wine tastes.
It is similar concept to the taste test launched by Morrison in 2012 in a collaboration with drinks supplier Bibendum, which was later used to remerchandise and segment the wine aisles according to wine styles. However, the retailer later returned to ranging its BWS aisles by country in 2015.

Organic and biodynamic, Dormilona translates from Spanish as “lazy bones” and epitomises the Margaret River producer’s ethos of minimum interference in the winemaking process.
The dinner will be served on ceramics by female collective Ophelia Works, with a playlist comprising of female artists including Hole, PJ Harvey and Stevie Nicks.
Taking place on the 8 and 9 of March, the dinner will be priced at £40 per person, with a flight of six wines for an additional £30.

Chef-turned-restaurateur Dhruv Mittal is set to open Lucknow Social in Mayfair this month, serving regional Indian cuisine.
Named in homage to the northern Indian cuisine Lucknowi, the restaurant will offer a lunch menu including gilafi kulcha bread with a choice of chicken kakori or lamb galauti kebab with the option of a smaller biryani to take away.  The dinner menu will feature kebabs such as the kakori kebab with clove, black pepper, and cinnamon, grilled over coals alongside slow-cooked curries and biryanis such as Awadhi chicken biryani, with saffron, rose water, screw pine essence, and a ‘perfume’ made with the roots of flowers.
Wine consultant and writer, Zeren Wilson, has been commissioned to design a wine list to pair with Lucknowi cuisine, including a selection of champagnes. Wilson’s previous clients include Santo Remedio, Smoking Goat, Kiln, Sambal Shiok, Arabica Bar and Kitchen, and Shuang Shuang. Mittal is also set to launch a Lucknow Social beer in collaboration with Hackney Brewery.
The interiors will be created by the award-winning New York-based design company MP Shift, to “celebrate the colours of India, the idiosyncrasies of Indian roadside café and the warmth of a Dhaba kitchen.” A playlist of acoustic Indian music will contribute to the immersive experience.
Mittal’s culinary background includes Heston Blumenthal’s The Fat Duck, Hibiscus and Restaurant Sat Bains, with the new restaurant on Maddox Street following the success of Mittal and team’s Dum Biryani House which opened on Wardour Street in 2016.
He said: “Awadhi cooking is a slow process, with most dishes taking days to prepare – it’s a real labour of love. Spending time cooking in Agra and travelling around Lucknow, I was blown away by its multi-layered flavours and cooking techniques.”
Lucknow Social opens in April.

The number of pubs, bars and nightclubs with 24-hour alcohol licenses has fallen nearly 20% in five years, a new study has found, as demand for late night drinking slows.
According to commercial law firm EMW, Since 2013, the number of number of pubs, bars and nightclubs with 24-hour alcohol licenses fell by 19%, from 919 in 2013 to around 742 last year, fuelled by low wage growth and the changing attitudes to booze among younger millennial consumers.
Meanwhile the number of supermarkets and retailers with a 24-hour license has increased 40% over the same period, from 1,909 in 2013 to 2680 last year, it said.
The firm argued that low real wage growth since the financial crisis as well as the uncertainties around Brexit had  dampened consumer spending in the late-night leisure sector and this was driving a shift in spending away from pubs and bars towards supermarkets, where alcohol is cheaper.
Marco Mauro, Legal Director at EMW said that although 24-hour alcohol licenses were expected to boost the night-time economy “this has simply not happened.”
“Continued cultural changes in the way people interact and socialise, such as through dating apps, and the rise of Netflix, has created less demand for pubs, bars and nightclubs. Increasingly many individuals are also now not going out until much later in the evening, and, as a result, they can often spend less on drinks at the pubs.”
He argued that for many venues, it was not financially sustainable to stay open for 24-hours as the costs outweighed the potential extra revenue.
He argued that without a more supportive attitude from local and central Government, there would be a “further decline in this part of the late-night economy”.

Pinot Noir from Central Otago in New Zealand has come of age, and producers in the region are making “some of the best wines anywhere”, according to Jasper Morris MW.
Central Otago has come of age and its producers are making “some of the best wines anywhere”, says Jasper Morris MW
Speaking at the Central Otago Pinot Celebration in Queenstown, Morris said how far the wines had come since he first visited the New Zealand region in the 90s.
“I first came to Central Otago in the late ‘90s. Back then there used to be too much shepherding in winemaking – acidifying at the beginning then de-acidifying at the end, which I was slightly shocked by.
“Now there is a move towards letting the Pinot come to you. The wines used to fade fast, which had a lot to do with the young age of the vines. It’s much less the case now.
Jasper Morris MW is a fan of the Pinot Noirs from Central Otago
“The region is making Pinots capable of ageing for much longer now, including some I wouldn’t want to drink for at least three to four years until everything is in place. It’s not about emulating Burgundy; it’s about exciting new ideas and an understanding of the land.
“Central Otago’s top winemakers aren’t leaving for other regions, quite the reverse, as you seem to be successfully sucking in new young blood and are making some of the best wines I see anywhere.”
New Zealand native Emma Jenkins MW, believes Central Otago has become a “shining light” in the country’s wine scene.
“Central Otago is a shining light in the NZ wine scene and something to take pride in.
“The region is now making Pinots with the potential to age and turn into something even more interesting, rather than simply getting older.
“Ever more interesting wines with a sense of place are coming out of the region. The Pinots have a signature silkiness and vibrancy with a red fruit profile and sappiness in the tannins,” she said.
At the conference Jenkins also spoke of the need to embrace the inherent fruitiness of the Pinots made in the South Island region.
“Sometimes the pejorative fruit bomb term gets used with regards to Central Otago Pinot, but who doesn’t like fruity wines?
The next chapter for Central Otago lies in telling the stories of its different sub-regions
“We shouldn’t be afraid of making fruity wines – people need a bit of hedonism every now and then. Some people like to drink austere wines just to feel superior,” she said.
Prophet’s Rock winemaker Paul Pujol, who chaired the conference, told attendees that the style of the Pinots being made in Central Otago had evolved in recent years.
“The older style of Central Otago Pinot was more opulent and powerful with higher alcohol. The wines we’re making are lighter in alcohol now. It feels right to pick earlier and capture a brightness and energy in the wines,” he said.
As for the next step for the region, Andy Crozier of Burn Cottage believes the future lies in highlighting the different styles of Pinot that are emerging from Central Otago’s main sub-regions.
“The next story that we need to tell in Central Otago is the story of our sub-regions – Wanaka, Gibbston, Bannockburn, Alexandra, Bendigo and Cromwell – but the question is, are people ready to hear it?
“We’ve had a lot of interest from sommeliers in the UK and Australia who want to delve deeper into Central Otago’s sub-regional differences.
“There is a coming of age in the region at the moment. Both the vines and the winemakers are growing up, and we’re learning what works where,” he said.

Anivin de France, the organisation responsible for promoting Vin de France wines, has chosen 130 ambassador wines for 2019.

The wines were selected at the ‘Best Value Vin de France Selection Tasting’ last month by an international group of judges.
Some 434 wines were entered from a total of 93 French wine companies. This year wine buyers from Taiwan, South Korea and Brazil joined the international panel alongside the USA, Australia, Japan, China and Europe. In total the panel consisted of 28 buyers from 14 different countries.
“It is always exciting to welcome new country market representatives into the judging panel, and particularly from emerging wine markets like Taiwan, South Korea and Brazil,” Valérie Pajotin, Director of Anivin de France, said.
“This proves that Vin de France is now an established category which appeals to both traditional and new export markets.”
The 130 winning wines (see list attached) were split into two categories: 29 gold medals; and 101 silver medals.
All of the medal-winning wines will be available to taste at ProWein this March, and at APAS in Brazil in May.

Dionisio Chaves, a member of Anivin’s buyer panel from Brazil, said it is “a really pertinent time for Vin de France to enter the Brazilian market.

“Brazilians don’t really know about appellations and regions – it’s too complicated. But they do know about France, and the France label has a real cachet for them.”

The Bordeaux 2016 vintage is akin to a “gentleman in a perfect suit”, thinks Tom Jenkins, the Bordeaux buyer for fine wine merchant Justerini & Brooks.
Speaking to the drinks business at the merchant’s annual tasting of wines from each Bordeaux vintage being made physical, Jenkins was unequivocal in voicing his liking for the vintage.
Recent tastings had confirmed it as a “perfect vintage”, he said, recalling its “freshness” and “restrained alcohol”. It was, he went on, the sort of vintage he’d, “like to drink every year”.
Although many merchants hadn’t been entirely thrilled by the campaign back in 2017, Jenkins said for Justerini & Brooks it had been “very good” and subsequent sales had also been good meaning there was “very little left”.
From the “bits and pieces” that are still around, there hadn’t been a big rush to buy as a result of the critics’ rapturous in-bottle scores he added; largely because the highest-scorers are now either sold out or mightily difficult to find.
On the other hand, there is still plenty of ‘petit châteaux’ stock available and while Jenkins said there was “no rush to buy” them, he still considered them worth picking up as drinking stock.
And it is true that labels such as Picque Caillou and Peyrabon at under £20 a bottle offer not only excellent value for any type of wine buyer or collector but, in a vintage such as 2016, perfectly excellent drinking.

A beer festival run by the Manchester craft brewery Cloudwater over the weekend was saved at the last minute when the council performed a U-turn allowing it to go ahead, as long as there was no drunkenness on site.
Cloudwater’s Friends and Family Beer Festival, its first event on this scale, was scheduled to take place on 1 and 2 March. Bringing together all of the breweries with whom it had ever collaborated, the event went ahead as planned on Friday 1 March.
However, on Friday evening, the brewery was told by the police that the venue, Upper Campfield Market, was not licensed to serve alcohol, despite it being told the opposite by a managing agent acting on behalf of Manchester City Council.
As such it was left with the task of finding an alternative venue for the sold-out event, with both planned sessions for the following day having sold 850 tickets. Around 65 breweries from around the world, including Cloudwater, were due to pour at the event.
Taking to social media, the brewer pleaded for help to resolve the situation, stating: “This is some of the worst news we could possibly receive right now. The police have informed us that Upper Campfield Market is not, as we have been assured on many occasions by the managing agent acting on behalf of Manchester City Council, licensed for the sale of alcohol.
“The attending police officer earlier this evening, the two licensing officers, a licensing solicitor, and even the night-time tzar of Greater Manchester, appear to have exhausted every option to allow us to operate in Upper Campfield Market tomorrow. If we ignore the licensing team, and run tomorrow anyway, [we] risk an unlimited fine or six months imprisonment.
“Despite meeting every other operational requirement and licensing condition, we have been told there is nothing further either GMP or Manchester City Council can do to help.”
Finally at the eleventh hour, the brewery was given permission to continue at the site, with the council turning a blind-eye to the licensing issues.
In a statement, Cloudwater said: “The city, and an incredible number of its top people have pulled every single stop. Never felt this much support, had this much encouragement. We are continuing at Upper Campfield.
The brewer offered partial refunds to those who had tickets to the first session of the day. Night time economy adviser for Greater Manchester, Sacha Lord, mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, and Manchester councillor, Pat Karney, were part of the team that worked behind the scenes to ensure the event went ahead.
“To everyone we let down, we are deeply sorry. To everyone that will make it, come have a great time but please help us get this over the line without a single hitch. We can not allow any drunkenness on site without facing severe consequences,” Cloudwater added.
Speaking to Manchester Evening News on Saturday, Lord commented: “Two sessions had been planned for today – one from morning until mid afternoon and another from mid afternoon until 10pm. Both sessions had sold 850 tickets – a sell out.
“The council will turn a blind eye on this occasion. The U-turn has been achieved thanks to the amount of love and positivity and support for Cloudwater, which has been phenomenal. They have been led down the garden path and were looking at reputation and financial damage. But it is good to see a common sense approach.”

UK discounter Lidl has unveiled its latest Spring wine tour of primarily modern Mediterranean wines, as it confirms a new head of the wine department.
(Photo: Wiki)
The retailer, which renamed its successful Wine Cellar concept as Wine Tour around 18 months ago, is releasing 28 wines – nine white wines, one sparkling, two Spanish rosé, 15 reds and two sweet wines – for Spring and Easter, which go on sale from 28 March.
However, speaking to db at its Spring tasting last week, the retailer has also confirmed that wine buying manager Anna Krettman left the business in December for a new opportunity in Canada, and the wine department is now being headed up by Verena Alter, Lidl’s Head of Food Buying.
Alter has been with the company since May 2013, after joining Lidl from Metro Cash & Carry, and is responsible for a number of categories in addition to wine. Krettman joined the discounter in 2015 as a protegee of Ben Hulme, the graduate trainee turned UK, later International Head of BWS at Lidl, who is credited with turning around the discounters UK booze sales by launching the Lidl’s Wine Cellar concept. Krettmann took on the role of wine buying manager in 2016 when Hulme headed to the German head office to become the company’s international wine category director.
Spring wines
At the tasting, Lidl  consultant MW Ed Adams told db the Spring tour was predominantly a modern Mediterranean selection with a strong representation of wines from the Rhône and South of France for Easter that had been very positively received.
Highlights included a Colnem Costière de Nimes (rrp: £5.99), Spanish verdejo La Bien Pinta Rueda (rrp: £5.99), a Morgan from Beajolais (rrp: £7.99) a Vinsobres Cru Côtes du Rhône (rrp: £7.99), a Jamais Renoncer Rousillon, where there is “value to be had” and a Carles Priorat Crianza (rrp: £6.99).
“Spain is also coming to the fore and will be for the next tour,” he added.
Consultant MW Caroline Gilby added it was nice to see things that were not “run-of-the-mill”, such as an Eje Monastrell, the two sweet wines, a Tokaji Szamorodni Béres and a Malaga Virgen Moscatel (both rrp: £6.99), and the Cru Beajolais, Morgan (rrp: £7.99) that was both “slightly off the beaten track” and offered good value.
Lidl said consumers were increasingly having more confidence to try less usual wines. “The Tokaji is not mainstream in the UK, but Lidl is building consumers’ confidence,” a representative noted.
Around 20 of the still wines, which retail for around £4.99 – 7.99 are new to the retailer, but some have been included in previous Wine Tours.
“Some have been brought back if sales were good, it’s a good way to see what customers enjoy,” Lidl confirmed.
Lidl’s core range still numbers around 100 overall, and while there are no plans to widen this, wines that have performed well in the Wine Tours are occasionally added to the range – recent additions to the core range include a Côtes du Rhône that performed really well last year.
It is also planning to keep the price still wines in the collection at around the £ 5 – £8 price mark, although more expensive wines are introduced at peak seasons such as Christmas.
“If it happens to be a high price point, we would have to check that it fits our [strategy],” a representative said.
Speaking about Brexit, the retailer said it “planned to make sure it was business as usual as much as possible so it doesn’t affect our customers” – although would not be drawn on whether it is stockpiling wine or not.

The Liv-ex Fine Wine 100’s disappointing performance continued in the second month of the year, closing down 0.7% on its January finish but it wasn’t a bad month for 2009 Bordeaux.
The leading index ran flat in January but took a downturn in February to mark a fifth consecutive month without a positive performance.
However, it was a bright month for Bordeaux, especially the 2009 vintage which has received a great deal of attention recently as it hits its first decade.
The 2009 Haut-Bailly in particular, which received 100-points from Robert Parker in one of his last lead tastings for The Wine Advocate, saw its price shoot up 14% to almost £2,000 a case.
Another 100-pointer, Smith Haut-Lafitte also went up though by a rather more modest 4%.
La Mission Haut-Brion’s 2009 rose as well as did Léoville Poyferré’s 2010 vintage while Penfolds 2008 Grange also performed well last month.
Going down meanwhile it was a bad month for vintages ending in ‘5’. Apart from Masseto’s 2014 vintage which slipped down 4.3%, the worst fallers in descending order comprised: Clos des Pape’s 2015 Chateauneuf du Pape; Mouton Rothschild’s 2005; Domaine Ponsot’s 2015 Clos de la Roche and Armand Rousseau’s 2015 Chambertin.

Last year, The WSET announced it would introduce a Level 3 course devoted exclusively to the spirits industry. At the same time, it also said the Level 4 Diploma would get a shake-up of its own.
The new course, set to launch on 1 August 2019, will focus exclusively on wine, replacing the previous version that devoted a small section to vodka, gin and whisk(e)y, and would also introduce new online learning materials as well as a Wines of the World module, allowing educators to go into greater depth on New World wines.
Hoping give a better insight to industry insiders in the UK and beyond, the WSET is hosting a roadshow across key trade shows and certified schools before the new qualification goes live.
The information sessions, aimed at prospective students, will give a first look at the new WSET Level 4 Diploma.
The sessions will explain why the WSET Diploma is changing, the key changes to the qualification, and how students will benefit from taking the course. Participants will also get the opportunity to hear first-hand from Diploma graduates in the industry on how the qualification has helped them progress their careers.
“The current WSET Diploma has been available for so long and is such a gold standard for wine education that the changed format is bound to raise a lot of questions<‘ WSET chief executive Ian Harris said.
“We are therefore excited to be able to launch this roadshow across our key markets in New York, Germany, London and Hong Kong.”
The new course will be debuted at these locations throughout March, April and May:

Celebrated jeweller and watchmaker Cartier is to sell a collection of fine wines from its cellar in London later this month.
Taking place on 20 March, the sale will feature 250 lots, totalling approximately 2,000 bottles, worth an estimated £250,000.
The wines span classic Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne, with vintages dating back to the early 20th century, with a particularly strong selection of Sauternes.
The collection was started many decades ago and was used to entertain guests of the French company.
Wines from the collection will all bear a sticker to certify their provenance.
Highlights from the consignment include: three bottles of 1916 Latour (£1,500-£2,000), twobottles of 1929 Latour (£3,000-£4,000), five bottles of 1914 Rieussec (£550-£700), five bottles of 1916 Yquem (£5,000-£6,000) and several bottles of 1937 Climens and Filhot.
From Burgundy there are various bottles of Romanée-Conti (2006 vintage) and La Tâche (2009) from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, a case of 2009 Chambertin Clos de Bèze from Faiveley (£1,800-£2,600) and a bottle of 1959 Salon from Champagne (£1,800-£2,600).
Serena Sutcliffe MW, honorary chairman, Sotheby’s Wine, said: “If Cartier has always been known for magnificent creations, illustrating the very best talent and skill, the wines in this collection take us into France’s greatest vineyards, where remarkable winemakers transform the grape into magical liquid.
“Connoisseurs of beautiful Cartier pieces are often also enthralled by exciting wine and we are thrilled to have been chosen to divulge the secrets of a niche collection that is scattered like precious stones with rare vintages.”
Cyrille Vigneron, CEO of Cartier International, said: “Cartier cultivates its singularity in its way to be open to the world, with curiosity, generosity and a spirit of sharing, including sharing good food and good wine with our guests.
“In this respect, Cartier has accumulated a great wine collection through the years. We thought that, in our time, it was more meaningful to share this amazing wine collection with a larger audience of inspired connoisseurs all over the world, and we are thankful to Sotheby’s for making this possible.”
Frédéric Guyot du Repaire, director, Sotheby’s Wine, London, said: “The extraordinary provenance of this collection will appeal not only to wine connoisseurs but also to lovers of Cartier. From early 20th-century Sauternes to rare Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, the sale is a very exciting opportunity to acquire fine wines drawn from what is ultimately a unique collection.”
Meanwhile, more rare claret will go on sale at the same auction. Hailing from a “remarkable cellar from Northern Europe,” the collection includes parcels of first growths, prized châteaux from the Right Bank and covering vintages back to the late 1950s and in various formats.
In addition, the collection includes a large amount of Montrachet from DRC dating back to the 1980s (as well as some of the red wines) and cases of Dominus from California.
The collection as a whole comprises 390 lots and around 3,000 bottles worth close to an estimated £1 million.

A Californian winery has launched what it claims is the first super premium canned wine in the UK’s retail market at just under £10 per tinny.

Larkin Wines, a winery based in Napa Valley which specialises Cabernet Sauvignon and red blends retailing at around £70, is set to launch a range of canned wines in the UK, focusing on wine merchants, speciality food and drink retailers and event catering companies.
The range, which will include a white blend (Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier and Rousanne), a Merlot and a rosé made from Pinot Noir, will retail at £9.99 per 375ml can. Distribution will be managed by Californian agency James Hocking Wine.
Grapes have been sourced from the same small plot vineyards used for Larkin’s bottling.
The new range will have the dual effect of “injecting fun into the super-premium category and premiumisation into the canned category,” according to an emailed statement.
“The idea came about when I was at the beach with friends and we had no wine due to the no glass policy,” owner and winemaker Sean Larkin said.
“I started researching alternatively-packaged wines already on the market, and quickly realised there was no offer within the super-premium category. It was pretty clear that putting top notch Napa Valley wine in a beer can might be divisive – and certainly a little crazy – but I genuinely feel there is significant market potential.”
Canned wine is making gains in the UK off-trade, with supermarket Sainsbury’s adding two French wine tinnies to its range last month. Waitrose has also has launched a range of canned wines in recent months.
Sales of canned wine have already soared in the US, with year-on-year sales up 43% in 2018.

UK wine agency business Hatch Mansfield has joined the international supporter community of the Institute of Masters of Wine (IMW).
Established in 1994 with Louis Jadot, Errazuriz and Villa Maria and headed up by Patrick McGrath MW (pictured), Hatch Mansfield remains independent and today represents 16 international wine companies.

Managing director Patrick McGrath MW said, “Hatch Mansfield has always been a long term champion of the IMW through Errazuriz, Louis Jadot and Villa Maria and a number of our brands supported the Masters of Wine Endowment Auction in 2017, which raised over £1m. I was so proud to be part of that amazing achievement. We also have three Masters of Wine in our team, which is an impressive ratio for a business of our size. All of this made it a natural decision in 2019 to formalise our commitment to the IMW and we are delighted to become a Supporter.”
The IMW now has 27 Supporters from around the world, who work jointly with the IMW to promote its mission of excellence, interaction and learning across all sectors of the global wine community.

It’s fantastic to now have Hatch Mansfield as an official Supporter. They have contributed to the mission of the IMW supporting the MW study programme for many years, and Patrick has made a significant personal contribution to the IMW, from being a former Chairman to the extraordinary Master of Wine Endowment Auction. We look forward to further developing our link with Hatch and the brands they represent.”

Sommelier and GM, Emma Underwood worked at “straight talking chef” Gary Usher’s Sticky Walnut, Burnt Truffle and then Hispi where she wrote the wine list. “My best mentor, Gary is a legend – we’d share a nice bottle of white Burgundy at the end of the week,” she recalls. Underwood also worked at Sam Buckley’s Where the Light Gets In, a tasting menu only experience matched with wines by the glass – but never a single bottle. “Sam feels sticking to one bottle of wine like is like having the same dish all over again,” she says.
Combining aspects such as suppliers from all the venues she has worked in, Underwood’s balanced, accessible and, for Mayfair, notably reasonably priced list at Stem is also nicely spaced, set in an attractive font called “PX Grotesque”.
At heart a Francophile, Underwood notes she “has to be comprehensive” nonetheless, hence Grosset Pinot Noir, mature Luciano Sandrone Barolo, the particularly popular Thracian Pinot Noir (Miroglio SOLI) and Czech Blaufrakisch (Tomas Cacik) rub shoulders with 20-year-old Alsatian Riesling (Rolly Gassman), Domaine Henri Gouges Nuits-St-Georges, the second vintage of La Folle Berthe, a Chenin Blanc made by “Parisian journalist turned biodynamic Saumur winemaker, David Foubert,” and following a recent visit to the producer, Champagne Charles Heidsieck by-the-glass.
Begin with South African vermouth, Caperitif and tonic. Then succumb to dishes by head chef, Sam Ashton-Booth (formerly of Orrery, Gidleigh Park and Story) which may include succulent aged beef tartare with king oyster mushroom and pickled cucumber matched with an aromatic, indie orange Slovakian (Slobodne Vinárstvo) which wears an avant-garde label showing a cockerel’s head bolted on a suited man, “lifting the dish’s garlic mayonnaise.”
However, pairings are not always vinous, hence the bergamot-infused Siren Yu Lu Berkshire Pale Ale with gnocchi with Romanesco and lovage.
“I’m inspired by the craft beer scene which I found in Manchester,” notes Underwood of Britain’s renaissance in craft beer. Finish with a sparkling Loire Chenin Blanc with rhubarb, jelly cheesecake and ginger. “Bubbles lift at the end of a meal when sweet wine and sweet pudding can be overpowering.”
When training her team, Underwood prefers to emphasise a wine’s backstory, the pleasure it confers, and its food-friendliness, rather than specific technicalities.
When not at Stem, you are likely to find Underwood at Joleen, The Laughing Heart and Naughty Piglets; otherwise she’ll be finishing her PhD on “Women, love and anarchism: the relationships of the British counter-culture, 1968-73″.

Crashing out of the EU without a deal will generate more than 600,000 additional forms that will cost the wine industry £70 million, ushering in the need for thousands of individual laboratory tests on all wine imports, the WSTA has warned.
A no-deal Brexit will cost the wine industry an estimated £70 million, the WSTA has warned
The warning follows Teresa May’s revised guidelines for the progress of Brexit over the coming months.
A vote on the PM’s revised withdrawal agreement from the EU will be put to MPs on 12 March. If that fails, MPs will be offered two further votes. The first will take place on 13 March on a no deal scenario.
If that fails, MPs will vote once more on extending article 50 beyond 29 March. If that fails, the UK will leave the EU with no deal.
This morning, the WSTA has written letters to Ministers Michael Gove, Liam Fox and Philip Hammond outlining its concerns over the mounting costs facing the wine industry in the event of a no deal Brexit.
Should that happen, it says UK wine businesses will have to “jump through hoops” to import wine into the UK with the introduction of new forms and laboratory test demands that will amount to costs of £70 million for both the UK and European wine industries. 
Under the current system, as a member of the EU, the UK has access to the EU’s Excise Movement Control System (EMCS) which tracks alcohol coming in and going out of the country documenting consignments electronically. EMCS allows all alcohol categories to and from the EU to be moved on with no extra checks of costs. Currently, 55% of wine consumed in the UK is imported from the EU.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, European wine producers will have to pay to fill out a VI-1 form to import wine into the UK, and for extra laboratory tests for every consignment of wine sent to the UK, no matter how big or small, generating an estimated 500,000 new VI-1 forms.
Likewise, any wine entering the EU from the UK will have to be accompanied by a VI-1 form, which will generate an estimated additional 150,000 forms. Each two-page form costs an estimated £20, which has to be filled out by hand. 
UK wine inspectors will find their workloads increase overnight, with every handwritten VI-1 form needing to be scrutinised and stamped before wine from Europe is allowed into the UK.
‘DROWNING IN PAPERWORK’
The WSTA estimates that it would take 12 full time wine inspectors a whole year to process the half a million new VI-1 forms expected to mount up after a no deal Brexit. This does not take into account the other work carried out by Wine Standards who currently consist of a team of six regional inspectors.
“The burden, particularly on small wine producers that often stock independent wine merchants, is likely to be too great and in some cases wine supplies from smaller vineyards into the UK are expected to dry up,” the WSTA warns.
When added to wine duty hikes, enforced by the Chancellor earlier this month, as well as the introduction of wine tariffs and rising inflation – a no deal Brexit will mean UK wine consumers will face a rise in prices.
“The additional form filling and laboratory tests required for a no deal scenario will come as a real blow to exporters and importers alike,” said Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA).
“Wine inspectors will find themselves drowning in paperwork and – unless they can double their workforce – wine consignments are going to be held up by unnecessary additional red tape. The reality is that if we leave the EU without a deal wine businesses, big and small, will be facing a catalogue of extra costs which will ultimately be passed onto the British consumer.”
A spokesperson for the SWA added: “A no-deal Brexit will lead to disruption in our exports to the EU and increased costs in other global markets.  Small and medium sized producers, as well as some companies in our supply chain, risk being worst affected.
“As both a consumer and excise good, complex changes to, for example, the labelling of Scotch Whisky and the procedures for moving consignments across Europe could be required at very short notice. The industry is investing a great deal of resources in no-deal preparedness, but there remain issues where planning is difficult because we cannot be certain of the terms under which we will be trading with Europe after 29 March.”
EMERGENCY PLANNING
The WSTA has been advising members for over a year that they should increase their stock by 20% as a starting point in case of a no deal Brexit.
Direct Wines have already brought in an additional 2 million bottles, about a 40% increase, on their usual stock, while Bibendum PLB (as part of C&C) have also ordered “significant” extra wine to have ready in stock. Majestic Wine has also said it will hold a further 1.5 million more bottles of European wine as part of emergency planning.
The WSTA has already called on the government to impose a temporary suspension on all wine tariffs until the end of 2020 in the event of a no deal, and now also to review proposed import rules in an effort to seek agreement from the EU to have continued access to EMCS.
Last year the WSTA launched its #NoToNoDeal Campaign. For more information, visit www.dontbottleit.co.uk.

Diageo is proposing to increase its stake in Chinese baijiu company, Sichuan Shuijingfang Company Limited (SJF) to 70% through a partial-tender offer.
The global drinks giant, which already owns 60% of the baijiu company, is proposing to up its stake by 10% at an offer of RMB 45 per share, although a statement said the proposal was still “under discussion”.
The company owns the Shui Jing Fang baijiu brand as well as liquor and white wine brands.
The proposal would be made through Diageo’s indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Grand Metropolitan International Holdings Limited.
In a statement on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, SJF said the proposal did not constitute the announcement of an offer and there was no obligation on Diageo or any of its subsidiary to make an offer and further developments would be communicated to shareholders “in due course”.
“Accordingly, shareholders in SJF have been advised that such proposal is still under discussion and there can be no certainty that any offer will be made. Shareholders have been further advised to be aware of investment risks in SJF shares,” it read.
Last June Diageo took a controlling stake in the baijiu company, after upping its stake from nearly 40% to 60%.
Since 2011 Diageo has had a controlling stake in the parent company, Sichan Chengdu Shuijingfang Group Company, which it bought outright in 2013, intending to build Shui Jing Fang into an internationally recognised brand by launching in the UK and Europe before the government crack-down on luxury gifting forced it to slash prices in the mid market.
However the local spirit has seen a resurgence in China in the past few years, having recovered from the extreme austerity measures introduced by the Chinese government in 2012. According to the figures from leading wine and spirits trade show Vinexpo and the IWSR, as reported by db’s sister publication, The Spirits Business, baijiu is expected to  grow 2.1% to 1.48bn nine-litre cases by 2021.

The PGA Tour is to finally allow distilled spirits sponsorships within its tournament, becoming the last major US sports league to “modernise its sponsorship policies” to include distilled spirits.
The PGA Tour is one of the last major US sporting leagues to allow for the sponsorship of distilled spirits brands, which were previously banned from the tournament
Under the updated policy, broadcasters will now be able to air distilled spirits advertising and show in-program exposure during PGA Tour network telecasts. Additionally, players can now wear the names or logos of distilled spirits companies on their clothing.
“This is welcome news for distilled spirits, as the PGA becomes the last major professional sports league to equalise the treatment of marketing and promotions with beer,” said Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council.
“The long putt just dropped. This is recognition of where consumers have moved in the marketplace over the last two decades. Further, it is an acknowledgment of the spirits industry’s track record of responsible marketing and underscores the fact that alcohol is alcohol.”
“One by one, major sports leagues have updated their policies to include spirits sponsorships and our marketing has been met with broad public acceptance,” said Swonger, noting that NASCAR modernised its policy to permit spirits sponsorships in 2004, NBA in 2009 and the NFL in 2017.
“These leagues realise that spirits companies are fully committed to responsibility, and that increasingly more and more of their adult fan base are spirits consumers.”
While sports sponsorships are commonplace across a wide range of sports, from football to rugby, baseball and horse racing, there has been more controversy over their use alongside motorsports.
Lobbyists have long lodged campaigns arguing that mixing alcohol with motorsports is irresponsible, while drinks companies have defended their tie ups by claiming it offers a global platform to promote responsible drinking.

Garçon Wines – the innovators behind the wine bottle that fits through a letter box – has launched a wine case that promises to slash the cost of transporting and storing wine by 60% and challenge the ‘grotesque’ inefficiency of wine logistics.
The London-based wine company has designed a case that fits ten of its flat wine bottles into the space that would normally fit four regular ones, by stacking the slimline bottles more efficiently, and making use of the airspace around the bottles necks.
The new 10 Flat Bottle Case is 55% smaller than the standard secondary packaging used in the industry, which typically contains 6 regular 75cl glass bottles, and once packed weighs around 8.5kgs, around 1k more than the regular 6-bottle case. It had the potential to slash the cost of packaging, warehousing, handling and transport, the company claimed.
Garçon Wines CEO & co-founder Santiago Navarro said using the 10 Flat Bottle Case in conjunction with the slimline 100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) PET bottles it launched in 2017 would offer reductions in CO2 emissions and business costs “never seen before”.
“Current wine transit cases used to transport 6 or 12 bottles of wine are inefficient and ineffective resulting in unnecessarily costly logistics, excessive packaging, wasted resources and a grotesque carbon footprint. This is because the bottles being used are not fit for purpose in a 21st century world of e-commerce, complex supply chains, a global world, and most importantly, climate change,” he said.
“The problems stemming from an unsuitable primary pack – a 19th century wine bottle – are amplified into secondary packaging that is equally, or arguably excessively, unsuitable.”
Excessive use of packaging at a time when the industry needed to be more resource efficient was “unsustainable”, he argued.
The space saving design is promising to cut packaging costs by half, slashing costs from up to 10p to just 5p per bottle on an average consignment of 50,0000 bottles, while also reducing the number of heavy goods vehicles on the road transporting pallets, cutting CO2 emissions by around 60%.
Navarro said the launch lead the way for change.
“Wine is a uniquely engaging product with a high emotional connection. It therefore provides a unique platform… to communicate a change in the way we do things to help mitigate against a climate change catastrophe and create a more sustainable economy,” he said.
“It will hopefully inspire and motivate other industries to follow suit.”
The 10 Flat Bottle Case, which was designed in collaboration with packaging company DS Smith, is being launched at Packaging Innovations Birmingham 2019 at the NEC on 27-28 February.

Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley have developed a method of brewing genetically-modified cannabis using beer yeast, hailing a cheaper and more environmentally-friendly method of producing the cannabinoids for both medical and recreational applications.
Researchers have found a way of synthesising cannabinoids from brewer’s yeast, without having to cultivate a plant, offering a more cost effective and environmentally friendly method of obtaining CBD and THC.
Researchers say they have found a way of using brewer’s yeast to produce low-cost and high-quality cannabinoids – mind-altering THC and non-psychoactive CBD – which could aid in the creation of more medical, and recreational, uses for cannabis.
Feeding only on sugar, the yeast are an easy and cheap way to produce pure cannabinoids that are typically costly to extract from the buds of the marijuana plant.
“For the consumer, the benefits are high-quality, low-cost CBD and THC: you get exactly what you want from yeast,” said Jay Keasling, a UC Berkeley professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and of bioengineering and a faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
“It is a safer, more environmentally friendly way to produce cannabinoids.”
To produce cannabinoids, researchers essentially feed sugar to genetically engineered yeast to produce THC, CBD and other cannabinoids normally produced only by marijuana plants.
Explaining further, the team said: “Turning yeast into chemical factories involves co-opting their metabolism so that, instead of turning sugar into alcohol, for example, yeast convert sugar into other chemicals that are then modified by added enzymes to produce a new product, such as THC, that the yeast secrete into the liquid surrounding them. The researchers ended up inserting more than a dozen genes into yeast, many of them copies of genes used by the marijuana plant to synthesize cannabinoids.”
While the applications of this research are aimed initially at medical purposes, it’s logical that they could be used across other segments of the market, including drinks companies, to make CBD or THC-infused beverages.
DRINKS MOVING IN ON CANNABIS MARKET
In the US, 10 states have already legalised the use of cannabis, including Michigan, Oklahoma, Vermont, Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, and Washington DC, and represents a multibillion-dollar business.
Constellation acquired a 9.9% share in Canopy Growth, Canada’s biggest traded cannabis firm, for  £141 million (US$179m) in October, back when, according to the Wall Street Journal, Canopy Growth had a market value of £1.3 billion (US$1.6bn). It has since said that it plans to invest a further US$4 billion, to acquire a 38% share of the business.
Meanwhile, Coca-Cola is reportedly in talks with Canadian cannabis producer Aurora to develop drinks infused with CBD, and UK-based Diageo is developing three different Canadian cannabis producers with the view to developing its own line of CBD-infused drinks.
A sparkling wine infused with the drug is also in development. According to Forbes, Californian cannabis-focused agriculture company Terra Tech, which has linked up with Washington-based cannabis drinks maker Valiente to produce a non-alcoholic sparkling wine infused with cannabis called ‘IVXX’.
Brewers are also making moves on the cannabis drinks market. Molson Coors has embarked on a joint venture with Quebec’s Hexo’s Corp to develop a range of cannabis drinks in Canada, while Heineken’s Lagunitas label has launched a brand specialising in non-alcoholic drinks infused with THC, marijuana’s active ingredient.
In Euromonitor’s 2019 “Here Comes Cannabis” report, Spiros Malandrakis, Euromonitor’s industry manager for alcoholic drinks, said: “Cannabis will ultimately culminate a global paradigm shift that will radically disrupt traditionalist industries such as alcoholic drinks.
“Reshaping millennia-old drinking rituals and providing an alternative to social lubrication occasions, cannabis should be either embraced as a symbiotic opportunity or faced as a potentially detrimental antagonist for an alcohol industry already on the defensive.”
MEDICAL APPLICATIONS
Medications containing THC have already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to reduce nausea after chemotherapy and to improve appetite in AIDS patients, while CBD, or cannabidiol, is used increasingly in cosmetics and as a treatment for childhood epileptic seizures. It is also being investigated as a therapy for numerous conditions, including anxiety, Parkinson’s disease and chronic pain.
However medical research on the more than 100 other chemicals in marijuana has been difficult, researchers say, because “the chemicals occur in tiny quantities, making them hard to extract from the plant. Inexpensive, purer sources – like yeast – could make such studies easier”.
This could be a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to produce desirable cannabis properties, without having to cultivate a plant, which is an “energy-intensive and environmentally-destructive industry”, that often brings with it the use of pesticides and fertilizer, and a higher demand for water. 
Using artificial lighting systems, one study estimated that California’s indoor cannabis industry accounts for 3% of the state’s electricity usage, which can add more than $1,000 to the price of a pound of weed, a press release from the University of California states, hence Keasling’s interest in finding a “green” way to produce the active chemicals in marijuana.
“It was an interesting scientific challenge,” he said. “But when you read about cases of patients who have seizures and are helped by CBD, especially children, you realize there is some value in these molecules, and that producing cannabinoids in yeast could really be great.”
The research will be published in the scientific journal, Nature.

The world’s largest brewer, AB InBev, has promised strong returns and increased profit growth this year after a renewed focus on premiumisation saw brands like Stella Artois and Corona drive sales,

AB InBev, which makes lagers such as Stella and Corona as well as owning smaller “craft”-focused producers like London’s Camden Brewery and Boston-based Goose Island, reported higher sales than expected in the last quarter of 2018 with a boost of 4.8% for the year as a whole, according to its annual results posted on 28 February. The brewer made USD$8.6 billion in underlying profit in 2018, and attributed much of its growth to the company’s “premiumisation initiatives.”
Paula Lindenberg, AB InBev’s UK president, said that the beer giant’s craft brands had “a great year, with Camden Hells Lager, Camden Pale Ale and Goose Island IPA featuring in the top five contributors to craft category growth in the on-trade, and Goose Island growing the fastest.”
Fourth-quarter core profit rose by 10% to $6.17 billion, higher than the 7% like-for-like increase forecast in a company-compiled poll.
Low and no-ABV beer made up around 8% of the brewer’s beer volumes last year, it said, “leveraging global health and wellness trends.” The company said it expects low and no products to make up 20% of its global volumes by 2025.
Performance, however, was below expectations in Argentina, Brazil and South Africa, which AB InBev said came as a result of “a weak macro economic environment putting pressure on the consumer in all three markets,” as well as volatile currency values.
The news comes after the brewer was forced to cut its dividend in half in October in a bid to pay off some of the debt from its SABMiller acquisition.
AB InBev closed its $79 billion deal to buy SABMiller in October 2016, having sold off a number of brands in Asia and Europe to appease competition regulators.

The US division of beer giant Heineken has announced that it will be cutting its workforce by 15%, stating that the restructuring would “enable more efficient ways of working”.

As reported by Brewbound, spokesperson for Heineken USA, Bjorn Trowery, confirmed in a statement that the company was making job cuts.
He said: “We are modifying our sales team structure to align with our strategy and to enable more efficient ways of working.
“This will help Heineken USA be more cost effective, and allow us to reinvest behind our brands and business in the US. While change that impacts our people is always difficult, we believe these changes will better position Heineken USA for the future.”
Trowery also told the news site that Heineken was “actively” seeking “new opportunities” for those members of staff who are losing their roles.
In October last year, Heineken-owned brewer Lagunitas made over 100 employees redundant –12% of its workforce – in the wake of what it called a rapidly evolving and “more challenging” market.
Other big beer companies to have made cuts in recent months include AB InBev, MillerCoors, Constellation Brands and Pabst Brewing. Constellation Brands also recently confirmed rumours that will sell or discontinue up to 40% of its wine and spirits portfolio in order to focus on its “power brands” that retail for over $11.
Other American breweries that have made job cuts recently include Oregon-based Deschutes, the 10th largest craft brewer in America, which laid off 10% of its staff after planned growth failed to materialise.
According to recent figures released by US trade group the Distilled Spirits Council, in 2018, spirits continued to gain market share at the expense of beer and wine, rising by 0.7% to 37.4% of the total alcohol market. The trade group revealed that in the past 20 years, beer’s US market share has fallen from 56% to 45.5%, while spirits and wine have increased their reach, rising from 28.2% to 37.3% and from 15.8% to 17.2% respectively.
In spite of the job cuts, Heineken has made a number of acquisitions over the past year. In June 2018, London craft brewer Beavertown sold a minority stake in the business to Heineken for £40 million. In August the Dutch beer giant also confirmed rumours that it was to acquire a 40% stake in China Resources Enterprise, the parent company of China’s largest brewer, for HK$24.4 billion (US$3.1 billion).
Heineken has also been investing heavily in the low and no-alcohol sector with Lagunitas releasing a non-alcoholic sparkling water last year and Heineken 0.0 unveiled in 2017.

Brewing giant Heineken will now sell its 0.0% ABV beer to pubs and bars in draught format, which it hopes will provide a “huge commercial opportunity for licensees.”

For the most part, non-alcoholic beers are sold in bottles, but according to data from CGA Strategy,  some 93% of all beer in the UK was consumed on draught format last year.
Heineken, has trialled its 0.0% ABV beer through draught system Blade in 60 outlets around the UK from September to December, reporting an average of 20 pints sold each week. Otto Esser, Heineken’s head of blade, said its latest low-and-no innovation is a “revolutionary step for the beer and cider category and one that we are proud to be leading.”
Last year, Suffolk-based brewer St Peter’s partnered with pub group Old Spot Company to serve the former’s 0.0% ale Without Gold at the latter’s sites in Lemington Spa and Wokingham.
Stuart Green, manager of The Cabbage Patch, London, said there is a “bigger demand for an alcohol-free beer and, if we are all being honest, previous products were pretty poor and garnered a negative perception from drinkers.”
“When HEINEKEN released Heineken 0.0 on Blade, we took it on as a trial and it has absolutely flown, the demand from the consumers has far exceeded our expectations.
“We are now selling 60-80 pints per week in addition to our existing packaged sales, of 1-3 cases per week.”

Vineyards in Napa and Sonoma have been submerged after the wettest storm of the winter swept through California yesterday, sparking weather warnings.
Sonoma was one of the areas most affected by the floods. This image, from Jordan Winery, shows flood damage from 2017
As reported by Reuters, Venado in Sonoma County has been flooded with 21 inches of rain driven by 75mph winds, while 9 inches fell in Santa Rosa. Waterlogged driveways made entry to some Sonoma wineries impossible, while across the Napa Valley vineyards remain flooded.
Adding salt to the wound, the ‘Pineapple Express’ tropical system from Hawaii brought rain to the mountains, melting snow and swelling creeks.

According to The Mercury News, the rising Russian River has swamped over 24 low-lying towns, leading thousands of residents to flee.
The Russian River reaches flood stage five times a decade, but the current storm is expected to cause the worst damage along the river in 24 years.
The Mercury News reports that up to 4,000 structures across the Russian River valley could be submerged by the floods, while emergency crews have had to rescue 40 people.
ABC News reports that the Napa River is continuing to rise and is expected to go over the 25-foot flood stage overnight, however, evacuations are not expected.
The Oakville Grade Road between the Silverado Trail and the Napa River is currently closed, while a number of homes in St. Helena are at risk from flooding.
The storm also swept through San Francisco, where the water level reached car wing mirrors. There are fears flash floods will cause mudslides in areas scorched by the recent wildfires in LA.
The storm is expected to continue until Friday, bringing with it rain, wind and snow, making travel into the Sierra Nevada mountain range dangerous. To the north, Oregon and Washington were also hit with rain and snow.

Named in homage to Iris Murdoch’s Booker prize winning 1978 psychological novel, The Sea, The Sea will be a fishmongers by day, metamorphosing into a Champagne bar by night.
Hunter said: “We’re using our restaurant experience and chef network to create a more accessible fish shop where customers can come and talk to people who cook fish for a living.”
The restaurant’s menu will be dictated by the catch of the day, with small plates consisting of raw, smoked and cured fish and shellfish, seafood platters and a selection of hot dishes.
A monthly changing wine list, featuring a selection of grower Champagnes and sparkling wines, will pair with an array of British rock and native oysters.
Weekly masterclasses in oyster shucking, fish filleting, curing and pickling will also be offered alongside a guest fishmonger series with chefs including Ikoyi’s Jeremy Chan and Londrino’s Leandro Carreira.
Located on Pavilion Road, the interiors have been created by Coriander Buildings, who also designed and built Bonnie Gull on Bateman Street.

Traditional fine wine merchant Clos & Cru has relaunched itself as a video-led educational e-commerce site aiming to demystify the fine wine market, following the sale of the business.
The company was bought by its shareholders last year and has been remodelled and relaunched as a more contemporary way to buy fine wine, incorporating single bottles and mixed wine cases curated around video-content, to provide an “end-to-end learning process”. The company also plans to run ‘experiential’ events later in the year
The new business is headed up by MD John Fleetwood, who was brought on board last July from Coco-Cola, where he headed up the Tesco and online business, with co-founder Martyn Zemavicius, a former sommelier at Harvey Nichols Oxo Tower restaurant, as Wine Director.
“They wanted to build a new concept to contemporise the fine wine market, and make it more accessible,” marketing director Elly Ling, told db. 
“The main difference is that Clos & Cru was a traditional way of selling wine, focussed on personal sales and without a transactional website, but now the platform has a transactional and is a content-led business, although personal sales and service for B2B customers is still available.”
The site has launched with a seven-part series introduction on fine wine, The Essentials, to demystify fine wines which includes information on how to read labels, store and serve wine and understand its hidden costs, which will be followed by four further levels, The Explorer, The Connoisseur, The Expert, and The Master.
It has also released three short videos on wines from Burgundy, Champagne, and Bordeaux, but said it intends to cover regions in the New World, rare wines as well as lifestyle content, posting two new videos a week, as well as expanding its 250-300 sku range.
“We want to bring the customer on a journey,” she said, admitting it was less about targeting a specific age-group, but more about attracting people who enjoyed wine and wanted to know more, but struggled to find that information.
“As well as tapping into the current audience, we wanted to go beyond that and tape into a wider audience to bring them into fine wine,” she said, “demonstrating the difference between buying a £50 bottle and a £15 bottle.”
“We want to bridge that gap for people. But we’re mindful we’re a luxury brand and are mindful not to go too mainstream.”

The London Wine Fair is launching a dedicated section just for Champagne at this year’s exhibition in May – and it’s being called Champagne Boulevard.

News of the initiative for the UK’s biggest wine trade exhibition was announced at a briefing by the London Wine Fair (LWF) on Tuesday this week, although details of the additional element to the show were unearthed exclusively by db during an interview with LWF director Hannah Tovey the following day.
The decision to launch the concept follows news that the Comité Champagne – which is the trade association representing the growers and producers of the appellation – will not be running an event at this year’s London Wine Fair, nor any major London-based tasting in 2019.
Back in 2016, as db was first to report, the Comite Champagne decided to end its traditional approach to presenting Champagne to a UK trade audience with a single large-scale event for buyers, called the Annual Champagne Tasting, which, for more than 20 years, had been held in central London in March.
However, following a backlash from the UK trade, the Champagne association trialled a new event in 2017 called The Official #Champagne Experience Day, which was held at a slightly later date (29 March), with enhanced content, and a novel, modern location – it was the first wine tasting to be held at design college Central Saint Martins in King’s Cross, London.
Following this, in 2018, the format was changed again, and the Comité Champagne decided to partner with LWF organisers, Brintex, and hold a tasting within the London wine fair at Kensington Olympia.
As db reported in January last year, the annual tasting had again been rebranded, named Champagne Live, and housed in two neighbouring rooms at Olympia on May 22 – the second day of the London fair.
It also, for the first time, included a consumer-facing element, with a free-pour tasting for the public in the evening following the day-long event for the trade.
Champagne Live also did away with the traditional format of individual brand tables, and instead featured themed tasting tables reflecting the key styles of Champagne.
However, for 2019, as db was first to learn in January during a breakfast meeting in Reims with director general of the Comité Champagne, Vincent Perrin, the association has decided not to repeat Champagne Live at the London Wine Fair, nor hold an annual tasting in London.
This, Perrin stressed, is no reflection of the declining importance of the UK as a market for Champagne – and budgets for promoting the product in the country have not been cut – but rather a move to rethink the strategy for presenting the product generically to key buyers and opinion formers in Britain, with, for 2019, a greater focus on education.
Such a view was echoed by Tovey, who told db this week, “The Champagne bureau is at pains to point out that its role is educational, not commercial.”
Indeed, it is believed by db that the Comité Champagne may be considering using some of its budget to take UK wine buyers to the region to enhance their appreciation of this fine French fizz, although this has not been confirmed.
However, with no single annual trade tasting from the Comité Champagne planned for 2019, Tovey said that she had decided to install a dedicated event for the sparkling wine herself.
“This year, as the Champagne Bureau decided not to repeat Champagne Live, we thought, let’s run it ourselves, so we have launched Champagne Boulevard, which is a London Wine Fair exercise,” she said.
In contrast to Champagne Live, which was a one-day event where representatives for the brands were asked not to pour the wines – although many of them were present – Champagne Boulevard will run for the full three days of LWF and include stands for producers to showcase their cuvées.
“It will give producers the opportunity to stand behind their pods and present their wines, so it is a more commercial exercise,” said Hannah, who also stressed that it was a “trade-only” tasting.
As for the location of the Champagne event, Tovey told db that it would take place on the first floor ‘Gallery’ section of Olympia, and could be entered from within the fair “by application or invitation”.
Looking back to Champagne Live, Tovey said that it had been a source of “learnings”.
“Champagne Live was a nice idea, and it was the Champagne Bureau’s annual tasting, but we were responsible for delivering the audience, while they hosted it on the day,” she began.
Continuing she said, “They were brave and tried not having any exhibitors behind the stands, and there was a split opinion on this – senior buyers wanted it [a free-pour tasting], but some of the exhibitors wanted to be there telling their own story.”
She also said, “And it was a shame that it was only for one day.”
Further explaining her reasons for running a Champagne section within this year’s LWF, Tovey said that she had sensed that there was a demand from the UK trade for tasting of the fizz, who are “aware that there are currently no plans for an Annual Champagne Tasting”.
“I have spoken to senior buyers, from top sommeliers to independent merchants, and they have all said that they need a space to compare and contrast Champagne – and so we have launched Champagne Boulevard in response to that need,” she concluded.
The LWF, incorporating Champagne Boulevard, will take place from Monday 20 May to Wednesday 22 May at London Olympia.

Former head-chef of Mayfair Italian Babbo, Carlo Scotto, is set to open his first restaurant in Marylebone later this month, offering a menu influenced by his Neapolitan heritage.
Beginning his career aged thirteen as an apprentice at the Michelin-starred Don Salvatore in Naples, Scotto went on to work at Corbin & King in London and then at Michelin-starred Murano, training with the renowned Angela Hartnett, before working at Galvin La Chapelle and as head chef at Babbo.
Following the recent trend of dividing a restaurant into distinct areas, as seen with Hide and more recently Gloria, the 100-cover space will be split into two parts with XR, a 62-cover, casual dining restaurant on the ground floor offering both a lunch and a dinner service, and Xier itself on the first floor, open solely for dinner.
The menu will pay homage to Scotto’s Neopolitan background incorporating inspiration from his time spent travelling in both Japan and in Scandinavia.
Xier’s ten-course tasting menu, priced at £90, will feature Obsi blue prawns served with wild fennel, wasabi caviar and fresh raspberry and rose-cured salmon with foie gras, burnt figs, leaf oil and citrus dressing, and a beef cheek with cabbage, bone marrow, apple and date purée.
A vegetarian ten-course tasting menu will also be available, with dishes such as a stracciatella with pollen, lemon verbena, taro, and organic honey, a hay smoked vegetable tartare, black lava salt, crispy shallots and garden leaves, and a miso soup.
XR on the floor below will offer an à la carte menu with main courses such as Yellowfin tuna tartar with aubergine caviar, garden salad and taro chips, and classics including hanger steak, pickled walnuts, shallots, parsley, and baby aubergine. Dishes will be priced between £15 and £24.
Ingredients will be sourced from organic producers with the restaurant working in collaboration with the Rhug Estate Organic Farm in North Wales.
Scotto said: “It’s always been my ambition to open a restaurant that showcased what I love about food from around the world. Since I arrived, London is a place that has brought me incredible opportunities, so it felt right to open here and to showcase fantastic British produce.”
Xier will open on the 5 March.

A design and label company has developed a cutting-edge 3D prototype service for wine brands that allows brand owners to showcase new products to potential customers at an early stage of development.
Reflex Label Plus has developed the new ‘Proof Plus’ service which allows customers to have direct-printing capabilities onto a virtually limitless choice of three-dimensional bases.
It said that substrates (the surface of the base layer) and print finishes were often overlooked in the initial design stages and didn’t always form an integral part of the overall process, but this development would enables brand owners to visualise the brand before its goes to print, see what it looks like on shelf and give them the tools to sell their products to the consumer off- and on-trade during development.
As a result, this could help to fast-track a prototype through the creative process, streamlining the process and making it more cost-effective.
According to Reflex, the packaging industry was not challenging itself enough when it comes to using the latest print proofing technology to address simple issues.
“When it comes to design, the timeframes for launch are often exaggerated due to number of touch-points in the process and as a result fees increase,” it said. “There is a demand for quality and efficiency in a linear service that delivers on conception, creation, proofing, origination and print.”
The new system comes off the back of investment in the firm’s creative studio in Stamford, Lincolnshire, and includes: a cloud-based portal to enable quick repeats for proofs, matched colour process to ISO standards inclusive of 39L, spot colours to DE2000, braille to 250µm, setting colour standards before going to press, decorative tactile exceeding 60µm, foil embellishments and industry leading CAD, as well as a library stocks of substrates on-site for a range of proofing options and finishes.

After selling out during its trial run in Ireland and the US and creating a media storm, Conor McGregor’s Irish whiskey label is coming to the UK.

McGregor, who partnered with Eire Born Spirits to launch his whiskey label, Proper No. Twelve, said he was “humbled” by the widespread support his brand has received since it hit US and Ireland retailers last year.
A six month supply of the whiskey sold out just 10 days after it launched in September, leading supermarkets in Ireland to ration customers to two bottles per purchase.
Proper No. Twelve Irish Whiskey, produced by Eire Born, is made by former Bushmills distiller David Elderman. McGregor is the majority shareholder, CEO and chairman of the brand, and spent the last four months of 2018 touring the US to promote his label.
It has become the most followed spirit brand in the world on Instagram, gaining over 575,000 Instagram followers in less than five months.
McGregor said: “My success can be traced from the lessons I learned growing up, the values of loyalty and hard work. Proper No. Twelve is who I am.
“I respect other whiskeys, but we are not here to just take part, we are here to TAKE OVER!”
Proximo, which also works with Bushmills, Kraken rum and Boodles gin, was named McGregor’s distribution partner on its initial release, with a recommended retail price of around €35 (£30) in Ireland, and up to $29.99 in the USA.
When it was launched in September, McGregor said that $5 from every purchase of Proper No. Twelve would be donated to support “first responder charities” including emergency services.
“It has been an incredible start for Proper No. Twelve,” the MMA fighter said, “and I am humbled by the support of all our customers and most importantly the people who enjoy this proper Irish whiskey from a proper Irishman.”
McGregor also expanded on his own reasoning behind the name “Proper No. Twelve”.
“Many ask where the name Proper No. Twelve comes from, and it has true meaning to me. I was born and bred in the Dublin suburb of Crumlin, Dublin 12 – thus Proper No. Twelve.”
While this may be true, this wasn’t the label’s original name. McGregor initially tried to launch it under the name “Notorious” in 2016, but withdrew his original trademark application in September 2018, after facing opposition from the founder of Carlow Brewing Company.
Seamus O’Hara, founder of the County Carlow-based brewer, has owned the rights to a European trademark of the same name since 2016. McGregor was ordered to pay €600 (US$697) to O‘Hara for representation costs and opposition fee, but the athlete was able to relaunch the whiskey under its current name last year.

“We took the time to develop an incredible whiskey and I’m excited to share it with the world,” said McGregor.
The whiskey can be found in ASDA stores, or purchased online from Drinks Supermarket and the Whisky Exchange, retailing at £27.95.

Vinexpo New York makes its second annual appearance in the U.S. on Monday for two days at the Javits Center with pre-registered attendance up, but number of exhibitors down after its debut last year.

But the expo has already committed to a third consecutive Vinexpo New York for 2020, according to Mary Larkin, executive vice president of U.S. operations for Diversified Communications, a co-organiser.
This year there are slightly more than 400 exhibitors, compared to about 500 last year. “But we’re trending ahead of last year’s pre-registration figures by 25% to 30% more,” Larkin says, who declined to provide exact numbers.
The show is open only to the trade, which means attendees will be mainly American buyers for import and distribution firms as well as retail wine shop personnel and restaurant beverage managers and sommeliers. Unlike the big European exhibitions – Vinexpo Bordeaux, Prowein and Vinitaly – there are fewer international attendees at these country-specific events.
Because of space commitments already made by Javits Center, last year’s event was held on two levels, while Monday’s opening will be in a single, expandable hall, Larkin said, which is already committed to next year’s event.
“Countries tend to come every other year,” Larkin says, “and I already am getting early commitments for next year.” One absentee from this year’s event will be Vinexpo CEO, Christophe Navarre, who cancelled earlier in the week.
Among the biggest exhibitors this year in terms of space are Renaissance des Appellations, an organization of biodynamics producers, and New York Wine & Grape Foundation, who will share a pavilion, with the former appearing on Monday and the latter on Tuesday. WOW – the World of Organic Wines – will also have its own pavilion within the hall.
“We are trying to do a better job of educating producers on the advantages of exhibiting in one market,” Larkin says, “and we have retained Sonoma State University to help us do that.” Ray Johnson, executive director of the Wine Business Institute, and Geralyn Brostrom, lecturer at the Wine Business Institute, will be presenting “Opportunities, Obstacles, and Options in the US Beverage Alcohol Market” at a pre-show event on Sunday afternoon.
Doors to the expo will open at 10 a.m. on Monday and Tuesday and will close at 6 p.m. both days.

db‘s Phoebe French heads to Michelin-starred Alyn Williams at The Westbury for oysters and dill granita paired with Helles lager, and squab pigeon with beetroot ketchup accompanied by milk stout.
The concept: Housed within Mayfair’s Westbury Hotel, Alyn Williams opened his eponymous restaurant back in 2011. Just 10 months later it was awarded a Michelin star. Using classical French techniques, with influences from further afield, Williams has been praised by his contemporaries for his ability to marry flavours, whether they be delicate and subtle, or bold and intense.
From a first job as a trainee hairdresser, Williams has had stints at The Greenhouse, Zafferano, Chez Bruce, Pétrus and Claridge’s, working under the likes of Michel Perraud, Gordon Ramsay and Marcus Wareing. He was was head chef for Wareing at Pétrus when it won its second Michelin star in 2007.
From day one, in addition to a classic tasting menu, wine pairing option and à la carte offering, Alyn Williams at The Westbury has proffered both a vegetarian menu and a tasting menu paired with beer. “You could say we were a bit ahead of our time,” Williams says, with a smile.
Alyn Williams
The use of seasonal produce, specifically vegetables, has particular potency for Williams. Growing up in the 1970s in east London, he was, unusually for the time, exposed to fresh, home-grown vegetables through his father, who served up dishes packed with fresh produce from two allotments and his back garden. Williams, however, credits his wife as being the main inspiration behind the meat-free menu. Being a vegetarian, at restaurants she often suffered as a result, with meat-free dishes often treated as an after-thought. Fast forward to 2011, Williams promised he would put vegetables front and centre at his restaurant. 
Alyn Williams at The Westbury is also one of surprisingly few fine dining establishments in the UK to pay due attention to beer. Conducting regular tastings with the team to establish pairings, Williams initially enlisted the services of celebrated beer writer Melissa Cole to help with the restaurant’s selection. The beer list now features 24 different brews, with a strong showing from the UK. 
The decor: Opened in 1955, The Westbury was the first luxury American-built hotel to grace the capital. Taking over a section of Mayfair that was badly bombed in the Second World War, it was the brainchild of the polo-playing Phipps family, who built the first Westbury in 1927 in New York City.
The restaurant itself is dominated by rosewood panelling, muted by the camel tones of the chair coverings and carpets. Alternating coloured mood lighting and Williams’ prized green, back-lit plantariums break up the brown theme. Undoubtedly the most dominant features in the room are the impressive floor-to-ceiling wine fridges that also function as room dividers, separating off a private dining area from the main restaurant.
While the restaurant interior is perhaps lacking in personality, both the food and service are anything but.
The food and drink: On my visit, we chose the classic tasting menu paired with a beers, which is priced £20 beneath that of the wine pairing option. Greeted by a warm loaf of brown soda bread, with two types of butter, the meal began with a trio of small dishes: a scallop and nori tartlet; oyster, creme fraiche, cucumber jelly and dill granita and glazed langoustine skewered on a twig, with fennel pollen mayonnaise.
Cleverly designed to increase in flavour intensity, the freshness of the granita proved the perfect palate cleaner for the scallop and nori tartlet, and the well-seasoned, sweet langoustine tail, skewered on a twig, and slathered in a light aniseed-flavoured mayonnaise. This was paired with an organic Helles lager from Staffordshire’s Freedom Brewery, which I initially thought would overwhelm the likes of the delicate oyster. Quite the opposite. The pairing turned out to be my favourite of the evening, with the acidity and fizz of the beer pairing, dare I say, better than the usual match of Chablis or Champagne.
Lobster with caviar and sauce Jacqueline.
The Cornish halibut, served with celeriac, onion, chicken jus and truffle slices was accompanied by Somerset’s Wild Beer Co.’s Sleeping Lemons – a gose beer with flavours of preserved lemon and salt. The tart beer cut through the rich sauce accompanying the fish, acting as additional seasoning. Also pairing well was the chicken leg, maitake mushroom and mushroom broth with Sierra Nevada’s Torpedo Extra IPA. The beer, which at 7.2% ABV is strong with a slight cloying sweetness on its own, matched well with the intense umami flavours of the dish.
One of Williams’ real strengths is the positioning of light, palate-cleansing dishes throughout the menu. The first came in the guise of a house salad, lifted with slices of preserved lemon and a clever, crispy potato mesh. This was matched with Brasserie Lefebvre’s Blanche de Bruxelles, a light wheat beer with flavours of orange and coriander. The second was a yoghurt sorbet, draped in a blood orange jelly shroud with hidden bursts of white chocolate – a welcome measure of acidity and freshness towards the end of the meal. 
The final dish, entitled rhubarb and custard, featured sour slices of the vibrant pink stalks beneath custard, encased in crisp, sugared brick pastry. Both desserts were accompanied by Hawkes’ Dead and Berried mixed berry cider, produced in London’s Bermondsey. Made with strawberry, raspberry and blueberry, the cider provided the right degree of sweetness, but slightly overpowered the delicate rhubarb dish. 
Signature dishes: Williams does not have any fixed dishes on his menu, but rather favoured ingredients that regularly make an appearance when in season – turnips being one such example.
The highlights of the tasting menu were the lobster tail, served with caviar and sauce Jacqueline – this version being an intense lobster sauce flavoured with carrot. Once again, with the addition of the caviar, which arrives served on ice in a restaurant branded tub, Williams uses an additional ingredient to create an extra flavour dimension. Our waiters advised us to mix the caviar into the sauce, the saline black pearls bursting in the mouth to temper the robust cream-based sauce. This was paired with Aberdeenshire’s Six ° North creamy Wanderlust Wheat beer, its mellow flavours complimenting rather than competing with the dish.
Squab pigeon and beetroot.
The second stand-out plate was the squab pigeon adorned with grape scales, served with roasted beetroot and glossy beetroot ketchup and accompanied by a miniature copper saucepan, filled with pommes soufflées. Paired with the Milkshake milk stout from Bristol’s Wiper and True, the powerful earthy accents of the pigeon and beetroot paired beautifully with the creamy, malty, chocolate and vanilla sweetness of the beer. The pommes soufflées, notoriously difficult to make, were wonderful, crunchy, salt-laden puffs that provided an extra textural quality to the dish.
Who to know: Known for his hospitality, it doesn’t matter who you know, or indeed who you are, at the Williams’ restaurant, everyone is treated well – a mantra his former-mentor, Gordon Ramsay, has championed for many years. Seven different members of staff, including Williams himself, waited on our table, each one providing a level of service that merited the cost of the food alone.
Don’t leave without: scooping every last bit of caviar out of the pot. It greatly amuses the staff, to the extent that they’ll even wash the pot out for you to take home as a keepsake…
Last word: Located within a hotel without its own on-street frontage, it can be easy to pass by Alyn Williams at The Westbury. To do so, however, would be a mistake.
The food is worthy of its Michelin star accolade, and the service turns a trip to the restaurant into a proper experience. With vegetarian menus all the rage, chefs are now starting to do what Williams has done for the past eight years. The beer pairing menu, Williams tells me, is popular, particularly at the weekends when several tables usually opt for it. Introducing fine dining to beer and well-thought through vegetarian dishes is definitely something to be championed.
A word of warning: go easy on the bread and beer. If opting for the beer pairing menu, a bottle between two works well, any more and you’ll struggle to finish. While proving a great challenge, this will ensure there’s room at the end for the petit fours. I had to ask for a doggy bag.

Rebel Rabbet, the London-based “category-defying” spirits brand, is launching what it claims will be the world’s most affordable spirit made with the world’s most expensive ingredients, including white truffle, caviar and orris root.
Called Rebel Exile Spirits (RES):3 End of Austerity (EOA), the 44% ABV spirit will retail for £49.99 for 70cl. Flavoured with Alba white truffle, the spirit is then chill filtered through Beluga caviar with vacuum distilled orris root.
Launched at the end of last year, co-founders Matt McGivern and Dylan Bell are aiming to create a spirits line that is not constrained by category restrictions.
The pair will be unveiling a new spirit each month this year. When the they’ve completed the planned 13-bottle series, they will be auctioning the collection and donating the money to a chosen charity.
Referring to the latest spirit, the press release states: “You can enjoy the elevated finesse of white truffle from the comfort of your sofa, barefoot, as your mink slippers warm by the fire.”
The tasting note also reads: “For us it tastes like truffle hunting on the back of a mermaid. Smooth and dangerous, like daddy’s money, or an investment in the USD. Best served brass monkey cold over a chunk of an iceberg but if the private jet’s having a service then mix with soda for a ‘Skinny Rich Bitch.'”
The range so far…
McGivern, CEO of Rebel Rabbet, is also a chemist, distiller and new product development specialist. Having worked for William Grant & Sons, he also helped launched London’s first whisky in 100 years at The London Distillery Company, based in Bermondsey. Bell worked alongside McGivern at William Grant & Sons as the digital producer for Monkey Shoulder. He now works as business development executive for The London Distillery Company, supervising brands such as Dodds Gin and Kew Organic Gin.
Bell commented: “The most important factors were pushing our spirit ideas as far as we could take them and building our spirits from the grain up. That’s why collaborating with local brewers, designers and producers was vital in the development of the RES series. We want to revive forgotten spirits and recipes in the most authentic way possible but also not take ourselves too seriously.”
The pair’s first spirits were made in collaboration with Bermondsey brewer Anspach and Hobday. They used Saison yeast to ferment a 103-year-old Irish mash bill recipe, which was then triple distilled into new make spirit. For RES1, the triple-distilled new make spirit was blended with quince, vanilla, pink pepper, cassia bark, coriander seed and liquorice. For RES2, the spirit was aged for three months in Bourbon barrels that previously contained triple sec.

"Planning has been submitted for an immersive comic book restaurant based on the DC universe within the same building as American steakhouse restaurant Mash in London’s Piccadilly, which also seeks to revitalise the building’s 1930s art deco features."," 1st March, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/03/immersive-dc-comic-book-restaurant-planned-for-soho/,"1st March, 2019

Planning has been submitted for an immersive comic book restaurant based on the DC universe within the same building as American steakhouse restaurant Mash in London’s Piccadilly, which also seeks to revitalise the building’s 1930s art deco features.
The new restaurant will be rooted within the DC universe, drawing on characters including Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman.
The existing building, owned by Crown Estates, is the former Regents Palace Hotel in Piccadilly which is situated on a triangular site formed by Glasshouse, Brewer and Sherwood Streets. The Grade II listed building was opened in 1915 and was the largest Hotel in Europe at the time. In 1930s Oliver Bernard remodelled the restaurant and bars.
Mash is not thought to be closing to make way for the new restaurant, but developers have said the intention is to “demise some additional space surrounding the current restaurant unit at basement level 2 and 3 which is largely redundant and/or underused”.
“The proposal is to retain the current use as high end restaurant but to redecorate, reinstate lost features of the 1930s interior and make minor alterations to the access into the former Titanic Bar,” the planning application states.
Parts of the building will be transformed into a restaurant “rooted within the DC Multiverse,” if a planning application submitted to Westminster Council is approved, making way for a 317-cover restaurant.
A design and access statement states: “The proposed design continues the use of the space as a high-end restaurant. The restaurant will be rooted within the DC Multiverse, taking visitors on a culinary adventure through the many fictional Universes famous for their superhero residents such as Batman, Superman and Wonderwoman.
“The style and design of the DC Multiverse is heavily influenced by the Art Deco period with the style prominent within its publications and film and television work. The restaurant will not be a ‘theme park’ with literal sets and costumes from the franchise, but it has the intention to invite guests to experience the DC Universe without breaking the fourth wall- the imaginary wall that separates the audience from the performance.”
According to planning documents, the main dining room will be divided into five spaces that will include a lounge Bar, called Pennyworth’s, which will be inspired by the original Oliver Bernard Design for the Titanic Bar previously housed at the building during the 1930s, alongside the Iceberg Lounge.
These areas will be complemented by two dining areas – a main restaurant called Dichotomy Fine Dining and an immersive dining experience based on Arkham – the fictional psychiatric hospital most prominent in Batman stories.
A “high-end restaurateur” has apparently been identified by Crown Estates to execute this vision.
A decision is expected by 16 April.

Seedlip, the world’s first distilled non-alcoholic spirit, has secured a new national retail listing with UK retailer Sainsbury’s.
Seedlip Grove 42 will be available in Sainsbury’s nationwide
Seedlip Grove 42, the producers third and most recent addition, based on a citrus profile, will be available in 600+ Sainsbury’s supermarkets around the UK from this month.
The third variant is a “celebration of the Orange”, according to the brand; a citrus blend of copper-pot distillates including bitter orange, mandarin, blood orange, lemongrass, ginger & lemon.
Seedlip was founded by Ben Branson in his kitchen in the woods with a small copper still & a copy of The Art of Distillation written in 1651 which documented apothecaries’ distilled non-alcoholic herbal remedies.
Following the launch of Seedlip’s first botanical drink in 2015, Distill Ventures, a Diageo-funded spirits innovation group, bought a minority stake in the business in 2016.
Today, the non-alcoholic drinks category is worth an estimated £100m, with the fastest segment of this being non-alcoholic spirits. Seedlip reported a +200% YOY volume growth across UK grocery sales in 2018.
Anne Cooper, buyer at Sainsbury’s, added: “We are really excited by the non-alcoholic category and know more and more of our shoppers are exploring this area.
“Working with Seedlip we are able to offer our customers greater quality choices for when they are not drinking.”

The regulatory body for the Spanish DO Rueda will be targeting the UK market this year after exports to the country rose by 41.7% to over a million bottles in 2017, up from more than 700,000 bottles in 2016.
Mario Muñoz, international promotional director for the DO Rueda
DO Rueda hosted a tasting this week at 67 Pall Mall in London, showcasing the new release 2018 wines, predominantly made from Verdejo.
Speaking to the drinks business, Mario Muñoz, international promotional director for the DO Rueda, said that the 2018 vintage was “quite hot with a long harvest period.”
“The advantage with Rueda is that most of the harvest can be done mechanically,” he said. “This means the producers can be selective about when to harvest the grapes and can get them in when they need to.
“In 2018, there was no stress on the plants and winemakers achieved enough alcohol as well as acidity. This was helped by the large difference in day and night temperatures – a feature of Rueda.”
A total of 130.6 million kilograms of grapes were harvested in 2018, of which 99.07% were white varieties. The tasting showcased over 30 wines including 21 Verdejos and Sauvignon Blancs, plus some older vintages including barrel-fermented Verdejos and the traditional dorado wines.
“Rueda has been growing a lot in the UK,” said Muñoz. “In the on-trade, as well as the domestic market in Spain, is where we’re seeing growth.
“Our wines are ‘gastronomic wines’ – good quality food helps to show them off.
“As well as the fresher styles, there’s also a trend for more complex wines and demand for them within Spain. We’re seeing winemakers increasingly use things like concrete eggs, barrel-ageing, and ageing on lees to produce a new category of wines.”
The 2018 vintage the first year where the new, simplified back-labels will be displayed on bottles produced in Rueda. The new logo only includes the wording ‘DO Rueda’ with a colour scheme used to signify the grape varieties or styles of wine.
“This was done mostly for the domestic market,” said Muñoz. “Rueda wines, specifically made from Verdejo, have around a 41% market share of domestic white wine sales in Spain. We were finding that consumers were requesting a Verdejo, expecting the quality level of Rueda but getting a wine produced in a different region in Spain.
“The other areas that grow Verdejo, for example La Mancha, have completely different soils, climates and vine clones to us, and as a result produce very different wines.
De Alberto Dorado.
“For us, naming the variety is less important in the domestic market. Most consumers in Spain know Rueda for its Verdejo.”
Rueda comprises 72 municipalities, located in the Community of Castile and León, with around 99% of its production being white wines, 87% of which are made from Verdejo. It is known for its pebble stone soils and altitude, which ranges from around 600 to 950 metres above sea level. The river Duero runs through the region from east to west.
Other varieties used in the region include: Viura, Sauvignon Blanc, Palomino Fino, Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Garnacha.
Speaking about the region’s Dorado wines, an oxidative style similar to Sherry, Muñoz explained that it was produced in the region until the 1970s when it was considered old-fashioned and began to fall from favour.
The wines, which are typically produced from Verdejo, are made into a dry white wine which is then poured into 16-litre glass demijohns. The alcohol is raised to around 17% ABV and then the containers are placed outside for one year to age under the sun.
They are then transferred into French oak barrels as part of a Solera system where they must spend a minimum of 24 months. Due to the constant blending process, Muñoz said a proportion of the wine in the barrels will be as old as 80 years.
While still a hard sell, the wines are slowly coming back into production again. Before, there were only two wineries producing the style, whereas now there are five. The Dorado wine on pour at the tasting was De Alberto Dorado 100% Verdejo DO Rueda, which retails for £19.

Jitka Auermüllerová, sommelier at 67 Pall Mall
More than 70 candidates from around the UK applied for a place at the UK final, which took place at The Four Seasons Hotel At Ten Trinity Square earlier this week.
The judging panel, comprising Ruinart’s Chef de Cave Frédéric Panaïotis, Ronan Sayburn MS and last year’s winner Tony Lecuroux, whittled entries down to 30 finalists who competed in a blind tasting competition and then participated in Panaïotis’ Masterclass: ‘In Gas We Trust – Oxidation V Reduction’.
On being crowned the UK winner, Jitka Auermüllerová said: “I see this event as a unique opportunity not only to sharpen you blind tasting skills, but also to meet with other motivated and talented people from the wine industry and share the passion and knowledge. The day of the Challenge was an amazing experience. After a truly challenging wine flight for the blind tasting, I really loved the Masterclass by Frédéric Panaïotis on oxidation and reduction in Champagne winemaking.”
The day finished with an informal Champagne lunch at the rooftop suite at the venue, with views across Tower Bridge and a glass of Ruinart Rosé in hand.
Auermüllerová will now join 15 other winning sommeliers of the Ruinart Sommelier Challenge final days (held in the US, Nordics, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Japan, Russia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia) for an all-expenses paid four-day educational trip to France in July.
This will be hosted by Ruinart’s chef de cave Frédéric Panaïotis and his team, but will cover many aspects of the region and its brands.
Runners-up, Christopher Parker of the Lime Wood Hotel in Hampshire, and Vincenzo Arnese from Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, each receive a Magnum of Ruinart Rosé NV.
“This year’s competition saw 26 talented Sommeliers take part in a competitive blind-tasting and an educational masterclass on ‘Oxidation vs Reduction: In Gas We Trust’, which for me is one of the best elements of the day,” said Panaïotis. “This was accompanied by a tasting of older vintages of Dom Ruinart Blanc de Blancs to show how the theory applies to various bottle formats.”
On a personal note, Panaïotis added: “I would like to dedicate the 2019 UK Ruinart Sommelier Challenge to wine world legend, Gerard Basset, who contributed so much to the previous three editions.”

A restaurant dedicated entirely to sausage is set to open in Islington with the aim of reinventing the humble hotdog, offering bangers from Blighty, bratwurst from Germany and kielbasa from Poland.
The Olma bratwurst, a protected Swiss variety of sausage served with purple mustard and pickled cabbage
Called X-Upper, the restaurant will serve “Europe’s finest gourmet sausages”, proclaiming, optimistically, that “sausage is the new burger”.
The restaurant, set to open this month, will be a 40-cover dining space offering sausages with sides and sourdough bread priced between £8 and £12.
Adding a serving of sophistication to the humble sausage is chef James Tanner, from Ready Steady Cook and Saturday Kitchen, who has led the menu development with the help of Francesco di Marzio, formerly executive chef at the two-Michelin starred restaurant The Greenhouse.
Sausages featured include several from local butchers’ shops, as well as the more exotic Olma bratwurst – a protected Swiss variety served with purple mustard and pickled cabbage – the Austrian Käsekrainer, and a smoky Polish kielbasa.
Craft beer will flow courtesy of Bermondsey-based FourPure brewery.
Managing director Mariam French said: “We’re so excited to be launching X-Upper. Forget what you think you knew about sausages! Sausages, in their many forms, are loved and consumed by millions of people.
“Through our travels around Europe, we uncovered a set of amazingly delicious and high-quality sausages and I can’t wait for Londoners to be exposed to the richness of our yummy products.
“Our mission is to completely re-invent the perception of sausage through serving authentic, high-quality, local provenance sausages that are true delicacies.”

Chef Anthony Demetre’s Mayfair restaurant, Wild Honey, is up for sale and could close later this month after 12 years in business, following challenges over its lease.
The restaurant has been on the market since January, as reported by Eater, with the lease up for renewal and less than three years to run. The restaurants’s future is undecided with staff on paid holiday for the duration of the temporary closure.
The opening of Wild Honey in 2007 followed Demetre and long-term business partner Will Smith’s Michelin-starred restaurant Arbutus in Soho, which opened in 2006 and closed in 2016.
Wild Honey’s menu, including dishes such as a grilled grass-fed Scottish Angus rib of beef, parsnips, caramelised onions, red wine sauce, alongside a roast saddle of Sika venison with cavolo nero, roast parsnips and kumquat marmalade, was designed to pair with a predominantly natural and biodynamic wine list.
Featuring wood-panelling, chandelier lighting and banquette seating, Wild Honey has been used for numerous film and television productions, most recently Oscar-nominated Phantom Thread.
Specialising in Vermouth, Demetre’s latest venture Vermuteria at Coal Drops Yard in King’s Cross, opened in 2018. The future of Wild Honey is currently undecided.

An alliance between some of the world’s biggest brewers is in jeopardy after an ad campaign by AB InBev, shown during the Super Bowl, led to a fall-out with rival MillerCoors over the use of corn syrup in brewing.
The rift began when AB InBev ran three adverts during the Super Bowl promoting its beer brand Bud Light. Using the brand’s tongue-in-cheek medieval theme, the ad highlighted the use of corn syrup by MillerCoors in its brands Miller Lite and Coors Light, ending with the tagline “Bud Light, brewed with no corn syrup”.
AB InBev, Molson Coors (the owner of MillerCoors), Heineken and Constellation Brands have been discussing a potential multimillion-dollar, industry-wide campaign for over a year in the wake of falling beer sales.
However, as the Wall Street Journal reports, MillerCoors has since pulled out of a meeting, planned for next month, calling for talks to be paused following the disagreement.
This is not the first time that the two brewers have slated each other’s beers, however the timing of AB InBev’s advert has been criticised.
Speaking to Wall Street Journal, Pete Marino, chief of communications at MillerCoors, said it would be a “waste of time and money” to work on the collaborative campaign “while the dominant industry leader is spending millions of dollars demonising beer ingredients.”
“Obviously since Anheuser-Busch used the largest marketing platform in the United States to demonise the beer category, we’ve decided to put that work on pause.
“AB InBev’s misguided attempt to gain a competitive advantage threatens to single-handedly set back the health of our category for a long time,” he added.
Chief executive of Heineken, Jean-François van Boxmeer, said the tone of AB InBev’s advert “was as unfriendly as I’ve seen during the Super Bowl campaign.” The brewer added that it remained committed to growing the beer category.
In response, Cesar Vargas, vice president of legal and corporate affairs at AB InBev, said that as far as the brewer was concerned, the campaign was still going ahead.
“We, along with other members of our industry, remain fully committed to strengthening the beer category and our joint efforts to highlight the very positive impact that beer has on our economy and in our communities will continue as planned,” Vargas said.
Referring to its advert, a spokesperson for the brewer stated that transparency was essential. “It’s a fact and one we thought consumers should know as they decide which beer to drink,” the statement read.
According to recent figures released by US trade group the Distilled Spirits Council, last year spirits continued to gain market share at the expense of beer and wine, rising by 0.7% to 37.4% of the total alcohol market. The trade group revealed that in the past 20 years, beer’s US market share has fallen from 56% to 45.5%, while spirits and wine have increased their reach, rising from 28.2% to 37.3% and from 15.8% to 17.2% respectively.
Corn syrup can be added in the brewing process to raise the level of fermentable sugars. Miller Coors has reiterated that it uses corn syrup rather than high-fructose corn syrup, the latter of which has been linked to health problems such as type 2 diabetes.

Dutch customs have seized 90,000 bottles of vodka found buried beneath an airplane fuselage on a Chinese ship believed to be bound for North Korea.

As reported by the BBC, customs agents seized the vodka from a ship bound for China in the port of Rotterdam on Friday last week, having received an anonymous tip off.
The container in question was found hidden beneath an airplane fuselage. Inside were 90,000 bottles of vodka, Dutch customs agents have confirmed.
Its destination was listed as China, but agents have said it suspect its real final port was Pyongyang, North Korea.
Roul Velleman, a spokesman for the Dutch customs agency, said the ship’s destination was officially listed to China, but was “probably” bound for North Korea. “All we can say is it was for North Korea,” he said. “We’re 90% sure (that was) its final destination.”
UN sanctions levied on North Korea because of its nuclear programme forbid the importing of luxury items such as vodka.
The seizure comes as Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump are set to meet for a second summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, to build upon their agreement to work toward denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.

As reported by La Revue du Vin de France the head of Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy, Bernard Arnault, was quick to notice that his biggest rival in luxury wine, François Pinault, had let Devauges go and decided to scoop him up for his own Burgundian estate.
Arnault acquired the Clos des Lambrays in 2015, while Pinault bought Clos de Tart in October 2017.
Pinault has decided to bring in a winemaker from one of his other properties, Château Grillet in the Rhône, to be winemaker at Clos de Tart, while Devauges will be replacing Boris Champy.
In addition, LRVF reported that LVMH is creating a new company, called LVMH Vins d’Exception which will be helmed by Arnault and include Château d’Yquem, Cheval Blanc, Clos des Lambrays and Colgin Cellars.

Diageo, the owner of closed Islay distillery Port Ellen, has announced the launch of a new series using malts from the distillery’s dwindling stocks, beginning with a 39 year-old bottling.
Closed over 30 years ago and due to be reopened in 2021, since 2001 whiskies from the distillery’s stocks were used in small batch releases by owner Diageo but contributions from Brora (another closed distillery due to be reopened) and Port Ellen were stopped last year.
Instead Diageo has launched a new series dubbed ‘Untold Stories’ of which the 39 year-old Port Ellen is the first edition.
Just 1,500 bottles have been produced and will be available from selected luxury retailers around the world with an RRP of £4,500 a bottle from this April.
Georgie Crawford, master distiller at Port Ellen said: “Setting a rare precedent for exceptional whisky since the beginning in 1825, this release is a perfect exploration of how early innovation at the distillery played a role in shaping the whisky industry as a whole. There’s an ethereal quality to Port Ellen and to the distillery itself.
“It is not easy to grasp what makes it so unique, but the people definitely matter. John Ramsay was an early innovator in the whisky industry, and not many people know how important Port Ellen was in the early days of the whisky industry. Through this release we hope to give more insight into why it is so special a liquid, not just for its flavour, but for its history.”
Tom Jones, global prestige brand ambassador commented: “This Port Ellen: Untold Stories The Spirit Safe, 39-Year-Old, is an exceptional Single Malt Scotch whisky from this storied distillery on Islay. Its ground-breaking founder skilfully harnessed the islands alluring, peaty wilderness and unforgiving coast line to create a distillery which produced cult whiskies with unrivalled depth. There is the regular smoke from the local peat, but this one is softer.
“As this release has been selected from a small number of casks, it is very different to other Port Ellen releases. Authentic in character, as it came from the casks and natural in colour, this liquid will no doubt inspire connoisseurs and collectors alike to own this once in a lifetime piece of history”

Legalised cannabis could be ‘detrimental’ to drinks companies that don’t adapt to its presence in the consumer market, according to a new report on the potential scope of a global marijuana industry.

According to the report, the drinks industry is the “most embedded” out of any consumer goods sector. A number of US drinks firms, including Constellation Brands, have already invested in cannabis startups and begun to develop products infused with the drug. UK-based Diageo has also been in talks with three different Cannadian cannabis producers with a view to developing its own line of CBD-infused drinks, while Californian brewer Lagunitas, owned by Heineken, launched its own THC-laced, alcoholic “beer” last summer.
If cannabis became legal worldwide, it would reshape “millennia-old drinking rituals and providing an alternative to social lubrication occasions,” said Spiros Malandrakis, drinks analyst at Euromonitor.
“Cannabis should be either embraced as a symbiotic opportunity or faced as a potentially detrimental antagonist for an alcohol industry already on the defensive,” he said.
The report, which also estimated that the global cannabis industry’s value will grow from USD$12 billion in 2018 to $166 billion in 2025 as more states and countries relax their own laws around the drug, claimed that, as alcohol consumption continues to fall steadily worldwide and the demand for low/no ABV products increases, cannabis producers will carve their own gap in the market.
“Drinks that contain any form of THC [the psychoactive compound found in cannabis] currently tend not to contain alcohol,” it said, as the effects of THC in alcohol are still being researched.”
“The industry is already headed in a low- / non-alcohol direction and so a future where THC replaces ABV in alcoholic beverages with an intoxicating buzz is on the horizon.”

A former employee at Napa’s Chateau Montelena has filed a lawsuit against the winery, alleging that his age and disability resulted in his dismissal in 2016.
As reported by Wine Business, Melvin Juler, who was 63 when he left the winery, claims that issues relating to his age, disability and medical treatment led to him be wrongfully dismissed three years ago.
Juler, who worked at the winery for 30 years and was formerly its ground department manager and landscaper, filed his lawsuit last month at the Napa County Superior Court. He alleges that he was sacked after requesting a leave of absence to seek treatment for Hepatitis C.
Juler was off work from November 2014 until August 2015. He states that the winery fired him after he requested “reasonable accommodation” for his illness.
Chateau Montelena officially terminated Juler’s contract in January 2016 and also alleged that he had sent an unprofessional email to a supervisor while on sick leave.
Juler is seeking damages in addition to lost wages and retirement and employee benefits.
According the court documents, Juler has already filed complaints against the winery with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing.
Château Montelena was made famous at the Judgement of Paris tasting in 1976. The winery is run by six partners – CEO Bo Barrett, his four siblings and his father’s surviving second wife, Judy –  who share ownership together with a board of directors.

The Premiere Napa Valley auction has praised the support of its longtime bidders, which helped boost the average price of the wines, despite a smaller number of lots on offer.
The live auction is organised annually by trade organisation Napa Valley Vintners and features a selection of wines created by NVV member winemakers, in quantities as small as 60 bottles and never more than 240. These are primarily bought by retailers and restaurant buyers to sell on to the consumer.
This year’s auction, which took place on Saturday and raised $3.7 million overall, was considerably smaller than both last year’s sale and that in 2017, with the number of lots falling by 30 lots to 187 from 217 last year and fewer bottles aimed at the $1,000 mark – but the average price of a bottle rose compared to last year in a promising sign for Napa winemakers.
The 2018 sale saw 217 lots raise $4.1m in total, slightly less than the $4.2m raised in 2017.
“We are very grateful for the support of our longtime bidders, as well as the 14 new successful bidders that acquired Premiere Napa Valley wines for the first time today,” Linda Reiff, president and CEO of the NVV said.
“These winning bidders will be ambassadors for Napa Valley, sharing the wines with customers in new markets.”
The majority of the wines sold this year, 72%, came from the difficult 2017 vintage, which saw heavy floods in winters in Northern California followed by heat spikes across the summer and devastating wildfires in October, which affected a small amount of wines with smoke taint.
Despite the tough vintage, the wines were described as “graceful”, with Bill Hayes, wine category manager of BevMo! calling the the 2017 Cabernet Sauvignons were “full of finesse and elegance”.
“They’re charming wines that express a seamlessness and long finish that will make these wines approachable early,” he said.
Speaking to Wine-Searcher.com, Cristina Pearce, director of the fine wine portfolio for Total Wine & More said there was “concern” going into the auction about the vintage, but that prices had stayed “pretty high”.
“Consumers are still collecting their favourite wines,” she told the site. “You see the same thing in France, in different vintages there. The average consumer is not worried about it.”
Top lots in the sale included wines from Silver Oak, Schrader Cellars, Shafer Vineyards, Duckhorn Vineyards, Marciano Estate, Raymond Vineyards, Seven Stones Winery, Rombauer Vineyards, Somnium Wine, Alpha Omega, Keenan Winery, St. Supéry Estate Vineyards & Winery, Quintessa, ZD Wines, Freemark Abbey, Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars and Arkenstone Vineyards.

Japan’s Suntory Spirits has discontinued further brands in its portfolio and announced the launch of its first global blended whisky, as the country continues to grapple with a shortage of aged whisky amid surging demand.
Suntory’s new global blended whisky Ao (碧) is named after the colour of the ocean.
‘Ao’ is a blend of whiskies from the Suntory Group’s own distilleries in five whisky-regions: Japan, the US, Scotland, Canada and Ireland, but will be available exclusively in Japan with an RRP of JPY5,000 (£33.98).
Taking whiskies from five different production regions, the resulting whisky is described as an “innovative, multi-faceted, premium blended whisky”, composed of liquid produced through several fermentation techniques, shapes and sizes of pot stills, and an assortment of casks.
‘Ao’ (碧) is a reference to the colour of the ocean, in tribute to the “crossing of oceans and seas” between the five whisky-producing regions used to make the blend. 
The bottle is five-sided to represent each region involved, and the calligraphic lettering was written by Japanese calligrapher Tansetsu Ogino.
“Suntory World Whisky ‘Ao’ brings together the world’s most highly regarded whisky regions to produce this unique and premium quality blend,” said Sho Semba, head of Suntory Spirits.
“In recent years we’ve seen a huge increase in demand from customers across the world who want to experience Japanese whisky. We are confident that whisky enthusiasts will enjoy the unique flavour that is the result of this Japan-blended whisky, which originates from around the world.”
Its release comes as the distiller confirmed the discontinuation of more whiskies from its portfolio, in addition to Hibiki 17 and Hakushu 12 last May, as distilleries continue to run out of aged stock.
The culled releases include blended whisky Shirokaku’s 700ml, 1.92l, 2.7l and 4l bottles, single grain Chita’s 350ml bottles, and blended whisky Kakubin’s 450ml bottles, all of which are available only on the domestic market.
Nikka meanwhile is discontinuing its Nikka 12, and temporarily suspending its Coffey Grain and malt whiskies, as reported by Forbes.
Discontinuations of Japanese whisky labels have been forced in recent years by a nationwide shortage of aged stocks, prompting the release of an increasing number of no age statement and blended whiskies. Suntory Spirits’s new global blend Ao, for example, has seen the distiller leverage its international relationship with Beam Suntory, its parent company, to procure wider whiskey stocks to plug a gap in supply.
The shortage of aged whisky has deepened as demand has surged in the past decade, especially at auction, with distilleries simply unable to maintain levels of aged stocks, forcing it to lean further on younger, blended expressions.
This shortage, however, is likely to naturally rebalance itself, as Japan sets aside a greater number of casks to age for use in future releases.

Based on Lisle Street, the new site will showcase interiors created as part of He’s own Five Lines Project, with dark wood paneling paired with brass fixtures and sliding glass windows. The restaurant will provide seventy-two covers, with small tables downstairs offering eighteen guests a more intimate dining experience.

Upmarket retailer Marks & Spencer has promised to ‘transform’ online grocery in the UK as it unveils its joint-venture with online grocer Ocado, following weeks of press speculation – but no changes are planned to its wine-by-the-case site.

The retailer, which already operates an online wine shop selling predominantly wine by the case, along with selected bottles of fine wines, magnums, wine for gifting, and spirits, confirmed the press rumours of a collaboration yesterday. Today announced it was acquiring a 50% share of the digital player’s UK’s retail business for £750 million, raising £600 million of equity to invest in the joint venture.
The move will allow M&S to accelerate its online ambitions for its food and drink through Ocado’s online technology and experience. The joint-venture will trade as Ocado.com, but sell M&S branded products, including its wines, beers and spirits range.
However a spokesman told db that there were no changes planned for the current online wine and food-to-go proposition as a result of the joint-venture.
The deal, which will share access to M&S’s database of 12million customer, will come into effect by 2020 following the end of Ocado’s sourcing agreement with Waitrose, which cost it £15 m last year.
“The joint-venture (JV) combines the strength of M&S’s brand and its leading food quality and innovation with Ocado’s unique and proprietary technology to create an unrivalled online offer for our customers,” M&S said in a statement. “In bringing the best together the JV will benefit existing and new UK customers, colleagues and suppliers.”
The deal is expected to yield ‘significant potential synergies’ of around £70 million per annum for M&S Food within three years, the retailer announced, on the back of increased buying power, and shared marketing and innovation.
The retailer already operates an online wine and flowers shop, has not confirmed how this would change.
Steve Rowe, M&S CEO said the move was “transformational”.

American actress Sarah Jessica Parker, famous for playing Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City, is launching a wine range in collaboration with New Zealand winery Invivo.
Sarah Jessica Parker has collaborated with New Zealand’s Invivo on a wine range that includes a rosé and a Sauvignon Blanc
Due to launch this summer, SJP worked alongside Invivo’s founders, Tim Lightbourne and Rob Cameron, to develop the range, which includes a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and a rosé.
“I’m a true wine lover and love including wine in family dinners and occasions with friends, so this is a very exciting and fun project for me. I’m looking forward to every stage of the creation process,” Parker said. “I intend to be very hands-on throughout, as I am with all my endeavours, and could not be partnering with a better brand than Invivo.
“I’m looking forward to traveling to New Zealand to see where the grapes grow and the wine is made. The boys even brought me a pair of gumboots, which, they assure me, are the height of Kiwi vineyard fashion,” she added.
SPJ will work with Invivo founders Tim Lightnourne (left) and Rob Cameron on her range
Rather than simply putting her name on the label, Parker will be involved in all aspects of the creation of the wines, from the naming and label design, to the winemaking and choosing the final blend. She is also a shareholder in the company.
“We want this wine range to be 100% Sarah Jessica Parker. So other than selecting the base wines for a Sauvignon Blanc and rosé, I’ll be taking a back seat and letting her create the blends.
“It comes down to SJP’s palate and preferences. We want to create wines that she loves and wants to drink and share with friends,” Cameron said.
“The partnership with Sarah Jessica feels like a perfect fit. We didn’t want a silent partner or just a familiar face – we wanted someone who will throw themselves into the process and make wine that’s all about them and reflects their good taste.
“We can already see this happening and can’t wait to taste the end product,” Lightbourne added. Invivo is fast carving a niche for lucrative celebrity wine collaborations.
Lightbourne and Cameron also work with chat show host Graham Norton on a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc that has proved wildly successful, and is currently the fastest-growing New Zealand wine brand in the UK.
The pair also worked with Norton to develop an Irish gin, which launched in the UK last year.
Parker is the star and executive producer of Divorce, which will soon return to HBO for a third season. In February 2014 she launched ‘SJP by Sarah Jessica Parker’, a shoe, clothing and accessory label.
She currently serves on the board of directors for the New York City ballet. Parker won two Emmy awards and four Golden Globes for her role as shoe-obsessed columnist Carrie Bradshaw in HBO’s late‘90s/early noughties hit, Sex and the City.
In addition to the Sex and the City movies, her film credits include: The Family Stone, Failure to Launch, The First Wives Club and Footloose.
Last September her Sex and the City co-star, Chris Noth, who played Mr. Big in the show, snapped up high-end Tequila brand Ambhar. Noth revealed to db while in London for the UK launch of Ambhar, that he thinks his Tequila tastes better than George Clooney’s Casamigos brand.

In line with Chinese customs figures, China’s imported wine experienced its first volume drop since 2014, with a moderate increase in value, the latest figures released by the country’s official trade organisation have revealed.
China imports
The newly released figures from the China Association Of Imports And Export Of Wine & Spirits (CAWS) showed that the country’s overall wine imports in 2018 dropped 8.26% in volume to 687.5 million litres, while its import value remained more or less the same with a 2.12% increase to US$2.85 billion, with exports hit by the country’s slowing economy and US-China trade war.
Earlier figures released by Chinese customs showed the country’s import volume dropped 8.95% and value was level with a 1.1% increase.
The discrepancy could be due to the fact that CAWS compiled its figures from its members, consisting of wine importers and merchants, while Chinese customs figures include statistics from importers as well as logistics companies.
The shared feeling among the trade is that the country’s slowing economy, the worst in 28 years since 1990, and the uncertainties from the US-China trade war, as well as depreciated RMB, China’s official currency, are bearing down on the wine market, and are likely to play out for 2019.
“We believe key challenges will be overall on the economic and financial side of Chinese economy. Besides the current slowdown, several key players in B2B are facing financial constraints to continue to maintain or grow their operations, whether in retail or wholesale. Same for corporate businesses which are entertaining less or cutting budgets. And of course end consumers are much more cautious now than before, and one of the main effects in the last years is seeing them consuming less in China but spending overseas,” Alberto Fernandez, managing partner of Torres China, told dbHK.
In contrast to the earlier customs figures that showed France, Australia, Spain and Italy all saw value drops in 2018, CAWS figures however showed that, for bottled wine imports at least, only France experienced a value dip.
Based on the country of origins for imported bottled wine, France still remains China’s biggest wine source for bottled wine imports.
Australian wine imports, based on CAWS figures, saw growth both in volume and value with gap between France narrowing gradually.
Chile’s volume and value remained more or less the same as 2017 with 0.01% increase in volume and 0.47% increase in import value.
Italy’s import volume remained unchanged with value grew by 4.92%, according to the CAWS data.
Spain suffered a 13.75% drop in import volume but value increased by 3.19%.
The country’s bulk wine imports dropped by 11.04% during the year to 160.6 million litres, while its value grew by 17.51% to US$186.7 million.

US retailer Costco has knocked Amazon off the top spot as the US’ favourite online retailer, a new survey has revealed, as breweries become the category consumers are most content with.
Customer satisfaction with US retail has fallen
The American Consumer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), which benchmarks customer satisfaction across multiple categories across the US economy, found the membership-based warehouse beat the online giant by one mark in its first entry in the list, clocking up 83 points, ahead of Amazon’s 82 (out of 100).
It also posted its best growth performance in four years, the ACSI pointed out.
“Costco is the value leader among online retailers and its Kirkland brand may be part of the reason why; Kirkland manufactures quality products at low cost, which helps keep competing brand prices low,” it said.
However, overall consumer satisfaction in retail fell for the second year in a row, down 0.9% to 77.4 and the ACIS said even though internet shopping was the most popular way of shopping, it was still ‘showing the strain’, as customer satisfaction fell by around 2.4% to 80 (out of 100), amid worsening customer service.
Mobile apps, however, are a bright spot, receiving high marks of 86 for quality and 85 for reliability,  ahead of satisfaction with retailers’ websites.
The survey also found that breweries were the most popular category of all, scoring a score of 85, ahead of internet shopping (80) and supermarkets (78). ABInbev was the brewery which won the highest score, ahead of Molson Coors, in the second spot.
The survey, which interviews around 300,000 customers each year in more than 400 companies across 46 different industries, is updated quarterly and serves as a key macroeconomic indicator of the health of the nation’s economy, it says, by helping predict consumer spending and GDP growth, with firms that show higher levels of customer satisfaction leading to higher earnings and stock returns compared to their competitors.

In our recent Asian Syrah and Malbec Masters, the results affirmed that Australia continues to be a reliable source for well-crafted, juicy and diverse Shiraz expressions; and that the success of Argentine Malbec is enticing more producers outside of Argentina to try their hand at the variety.
Syrah or Shiraz, a noble red grape that while extremely popular, has never quite captured wine drinkers’ imaginations in the same way as Pinot Noir or  Cabernet Sauvignon has. This curious as this is a grape that can capture both ends of price spectrum. It produces some of the world’s most sought-after and age-worthy collectibles in the Northern Rhône and at the same time is responsible for some of the most accessible, and reliable reds out in the market from brands such as Penfolds to McGuigan and Taylor’s Wine.
In Europe, consumers don’t have to look far to find good Syrah from its spiritual home in the Rhône and the UK has long been a big market for Australian Shiraz. The US has a taste for smart Syrah too but the market snubs the more inexpensive Australian Shiraz that comes to its shores, limiting the grape’s visibility. However, no other country at the moment has so openly embraced this grape variety, particularly from Australia, like China has done in recent years.
China, Australian Shiraz’s biggest wine hope 
Australian Shiraz has simply exploded in Asia in recent years. Of course, there’s the Australian government’s generous financial stimulus package, Australia’s well-perceived country image in China and the two parties’ Free Trade Agreement to help.
Nonetheless, attributing the new Australian Shiraz boom to China is hardly a stretch. As a matter of fact, mainland China, as Wine Australia summarises is “fuelling the growth of Shiraz exports”. Shiraz exports have grown to worth AU$638 million in 2018, and mainland China accounts for just over half of the export value, according to the trade association.
Being the biggest and most valuable export market for Australia, it’s natural that resources and energy from wineries and trade organisations are geared towards this market. This is also why in this year’s Asian Syrah Masters competition, Australia was by far the biggest source for entries and, consequently, the biggest winner on the medal chart.


About the competition

The Asian Syrah/Malbec Masters is a competition created and run by the drinks business Hong Kong, and is an extension of its successful Asian Masters series. The competition is exclusively for single varietal Syrah and Malbec wines and the entries were judged by a selection of experienced tasters including Hong Kong’s top sommeliers, wine buyers and wine educators. The top wines were awarded Gold (93 points or above), Silver (89 points or above) or Bronze (85 points or above) medals according to their result, and those samples that stood out as being outstanding received the ultimate accolade – the title of Master (97 points or above). The Sarah wines were tasted over the course of a single day on October 23 at The Flying Winemaker’s office, and the Malbec Masters was judged separately on November 16. This report features only the medal winners.



Barossa Valley, the sunny wine region in South Australia, often springs to mind when talking about Australian Shiraz. And of right reasons. The region produces luscious, layered Shiraz that can be cellared away for a long period of time.
There are of course lighter and fresher styles in the northern Rhône and parts of Australia as well that “exude elegance with great structure of tannins and fresh acidity,” commented Jennie Mack, founder and managing director of the Asia Wine Service & Education Centre (AWSEC).
But the struggle for producers in Barossa as in most warm regions, is over-ripeness, says Aki Wong of Accolade Wines, since the grape tends to be harvested at higher brix. The key for a great quality Shiraz is a good acidic backbone, well balanced alcohol, plus a rich, velvety palate with fine tannins, says the Master of Wine candidate.
Otherwise, if left on the vines for too long, as Kyle Oosterberg of The Flying Winemaker warns, the grapes will lose their aroma and acidity.

Shiraz icon Henschke’s ‘Kenyeton Euphonium’ 2014, a Shiraz dominant blend with a little Cabernet, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc is a good example of tip-top Barossa Shiraz.
Australian Vintage’s two Shiraz – Tempus Two Pewter Shiraz and McGuigan Farms Barossa Valley 2015 – were another two stellar reds. All three were awarded Gold medals.
Outside of Barossa, Shiraz thrives in McLaren Vale, a coastal region with more maritime influences.
The fast rise of Shiraz here is shown in our results, as two wines from the region came out on top to win the title of Master. Hickinbotham Brooks Road Shiraz delivered complexity, structure, and was considered a favourite by judge James Rowell, Corporate and VIP sales manager at Altaya Wines. And the Shottesbrooke Reserve Series ‘Eliza’ Shiraz also emerged as a top winner for the most coveted Master medal. Only released in top years, the Shiraz is velvety, savoury and textural that ticks everything that we love about Shiraz and costs less than HK$500. The winery’s more approachable Shottesbrooke Estate Series Shiraz also earned a Gold medal in the HK$150-HK$200 price band.

Australian wine brand McGuigan’s Wines has launched a new 2018 vintage of its Bin 9000 Semillon into Sainsbury’s.

The wine, which is made in Hunter Valley in New South Wales – a key area for Semillon – is one of McGuigan’s most awarded wines, having won a IWSC Semillion trophy eight times in nine years.
Chief winemaker, Neil McGuigan said the company was proud to be able to demonstrate the complexity of Australian Semillon.
“[It] is the Hunter Valley’s signature varietal and is deserving of its place among the world’s greatest wines”, he said. “We’re excited to see the distribution of our award-winning Semillon grow even further.”
The wine is available in Sainsbury’s, retailing for £14.
According to McGuigan, the 2018 vintage Semillon is full of delicate lime and pink lady apple flavours, with a crisp and fresh acidity that has a long-lasting finish.
“This wine drinks fresh & light when young, but also shows fantastic ageing quality and will develop distinctive toast and honey undertones as it ages,” it said.

The results from our Pinot Noir Masters Asia showed once more that New Zealand, California and Australian Pinot Noir continue to compare favourably with Burgundy.

In contrast to our previous varietal-focused wine competitions, Pinot Noir judging compared with more robust Cabernet Sauvignon or Shiraz can quickly descend into a hair-splitting debate. Arguably one of the most difficult grapes to handle, prone to spring frost and coulure in the vineyards and over-extraction in the cellar, the thin-skinned grape as judge Lawrence Osborne observed is “very temperamental”.
The antenna to find greatness is naturally more attuned at judging and, unforgivingly, any fault to be found in the fickle grape, more perhaps than in any other red variety, is unmistaken and amplified. Herbaceousness in unripe green fruits is translated into head-spinning weedkiller-like odour, while a jammy and inky Pinot is so out of character that makes you wonder if you are tasting a Rioja.
We are after all talking about Pinot Noir, a grape that doesn’t require much make-up or any at all. In fact, heavy-handed use of extraction or oak will end up masking the aromatics and typicity of the grape. The one place that has mastered the art of making Pinot Noir down to every single climat is Burgundy, which has coined a much imitated “Burgundian style.”
A great Pinot Noir, according to Linden Wilkie, founder and managing director The Fine Wine Experience, “gives a sense of lift. It’s all bouquet and on the palate [it] should feel almost gossamer light and silky while somewhere paradoxically delivering an overwhelming and lingering sense of fragrance.”

The idea of a superb Pinot is so romanticised that any wine region that is cool enough nowadays is making an attempt at mastering the grape. Many do so unsuccessfully but many more have triumphed as our results will show.
This year’s samples consisted of entries mainly from New World countries as well as Old World examples from France (excluding Burgundy paradoxically), Austria, Italy, and Greece though missing Switzerland and Germany two other important areas. The results revealed some serious contenders that are more than ready to take up the reign if the ever popular Burgundy continues to spike in price.
“Since Burgundy prices rocketed over the past few years, consumers are showing more and more interest in alternative regions for the grape variety. Pinot Noirs from the Loire Valley, Nahe, Baden, Central Otago, Sonoma or even Eastern European countries such as Hungary are getting more and more attention,” commented Szabolcs Menesi, head sommelier at the Island Shangri-la Hotel.

Outside of Burgundy, New Zealand is one of the foremost New World wine countries that has been staking its wine fortune on the red variety. Granted that the country’s reputation for Sauvignon Blanc predates Pinot Noir, but the latter might be where its future lies.
The success of the grape in the country has driven vine planting from 4,441 hectares in 2007 to 5,519 ha in 2016, according to New Zealand Winegrowers. Predominately grown in the more southernly regions such as Central Otago, Marlborough, Nelson, Waipara and Wairarapa, when done right, the grape makes elegant, structured and refined wines that can give Burgundy a good run for their money.
Highlights included Gold medallists Spy Valley Envoy Johnson Vineyard Pinot Noir 2014 and Jackson Family Wines’ Nobilo Icon Pinot Noir 2016 from Marlborough. Both are in the HK$300-HK$399 price band, proving that Marlborough can produce well-crafted Pinots with fruit intensity and concentration on clay and slit loam dominated soil.

Another gem is from North Otago’s Ostler Caroline’s Pinot Noir 2016 made from grapes grown on the southern side of sub-region of Waitaki Valley, showing cranberry and dark cherry as well as a lift of spices.
At this year’s competition, it was Australia, a country known for Shiraz and Bordeaux blends, that delivered some of the biggest surprises.
But as Sarah Wong, wine columnist and fellow judge noted, “Australia’s cool climate regions should not be overlooked. Pinots from Mornington Peninsula, Adelaide Hills and Tasmania are producing top quality wines.” Indeed, this year the top accolade of Master (given only to wines of exceptional quality) was awarded to Montalto Pennon Hill Pinot Noir from Mornington Peninsula.
“It was a delicious wine, showing great varietal expression with discreet oak handling,” she said. The cherry on top is that the refined red falls into HK$200-HK$299 price band, making it “a great value for money”, Wong continued.

The winery’s single vineyard Tuerong Block Pinot Noir 2017 was another high performer from the competition, taking home a Gold although carrying a higher price tag in the HK$400 to HK$799 band.
Further south in Tasmania was where another Pinot Noir, this time from the Tertini winery, captured the judges’ attention, winning a Gold.
De Bortoli’s single vineyard, small-plot Riorret Lusatia Park Pinot Noir made from old vines planted in Woori Yallock, on the upper side of the Yarra Valley, had a lovely brightness and lift and also won Gold. 
In California, a place that has likewise been more associated with Cabernet and Zinfindal in the past, has also carved out pockets of plots suitable for Pinot, often shrouded by Pacific fogs near the coast, or in areas at high elevation. One success was found in the Hahn Family Pinot Noir in southern California’s Monterey County.
Linden Wilkie, director of The Fine Wine Experience, checking wines after their identities are revealed
Grown primarily in the cool-climate Arroyo Seco region of Monterey County on gravelly alluvial plain at the foot of the Santa Lucia mountains, the grapes benefit from the cool winds that come in from Monterey Bay, which ensures gradual ripening and ideal development of vibrant flavours, producing a fruit-driven wine with finesse and balance.

A classic looking palace hotel, The Ritz, near London’s Green Park, boasts a vigorous, modern wine list matched with precision to colourful, pristine plates.

On my last visit, Etna born head sommelier and Master of Culinary Arts, Giovanni Ferlito brought lunch to a close by opening a 1978 Colheita Port (Barros) with a feather. Ferlito is one of the most inquisitive wine minds in the capital, zealously having added nearly 150 new listings to his already globe-trotting and discrimination-free, 93-page ‘Livre du Vin’ in the past year, including wines from China, Croatia, Japan and Uruguay, two new collections from Château Lafite and Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, and scarce sweet wines ‘served by the spoon’ (10ml) such as the pre-phylloxera Pio X 1903 ancient Moscatel (Gonzalez-Byass).
Both list and menus prices sensibly include the service charge, meaning the £40 starting point for a breezy bottle of Narince Diren from Tokat in Northern Turkey feels particularly bargainous in the context of the gilded Michelin-starred, Mayfair dining room. And there is abundant interest often well below £100 per bottle, be it Barolo, aged Madiran, Priorat, Pinot Noir from the USA, or a homegrown bottle of sparkling Gusbourne.
Around 100 wines are now available by the glass, including the new page of Contemporary Wines, featuring a wine from Etna; indeed, Ferlito also tends his own volcanic crater proximate vineyard, ‘Monte Rosso’ with two friends, Monte Rosso, 600m above sea level, though he is too humble to list it at his own workplace.
Orange wines appeared on the list post Ferlito’s visit to Georgia’s Imereti region where he learnt about the role of qvevris, and a young incarnation by the producer, Iago Bitarishvili was the favoured, earthy match with truffle dusted salt baked celeriac with goats cheese. Also, a fan of sherry, Ferlito, a past winner of the Copa Jerez with senior sous chef, Michael Nizzero, matches 30-year-old Apóstoles Palo Cortado with this dish from the ‘Menu Surprise’. Other intriguing matches could include almost 10-year-old Galician Albariño with langoustine and bronze fennel, and winning Cabernet, ‘Jia Bei Lan’ from Ningxia winery, Helan Qingxue with venison, parsnip and pear.
Hence, Ferlito and his far from robotic team of seven sommeliers, relishes being able to positively challenge guests to discover such wines, alongside dishes testament to the legacy of Auguste Escoffier, pristinely realised by ‘a Geordie from hard, working-class background’, turned Chairman of the Academy of Culinary Arts, and mind behind The Ritz cookbook, executive chef, John Williams MBE.

Hoping to capitalise on the growing popularity of the white Port and tonic serve in the UK, Kopke has released a ‘Very Old Dry White’ Port priced at £290 a bottle.

With just 350 bottles going on sale through UK importer Hayward Bros, the white Port is a blend of very old and rare wines from the last century aged in 300-litre casks for at least 50 years.
According to its makers, Kopke Very Old Dry White has “intense and complex aromas of spice, dried fruit, yellow stone fruits and delicate notes of citrus”. “Vibrant” yellow in colour and dry on the palate, the Port boasts a “concentrated, rich and velvety mouthfeel”, rounding off with “an incredible delicate finish”.
“We are so fortunate here at Kopke to be custodians of these very old and rare wines and we feel we have a duty to safeguard this legacy for future generations. We also wanted to celebrate our history by creating this Very Old Dry White”, said Carlos Alves, Sogevinus Fine Wines’ Port winemaker and master blender.
“Although delicate, this Port is versatile and is the perfect match for an almond tart, apple crumble, or even paired with a blue cheese, foie gras, scallop gratin or prawn tempura,” Alves added.
Founded in 1638 by Nicolau Kopke, Kopke was established long before the Douro was recognised as a demarcated wine region. Today, Kopke is known for its old Colheitas and unique collection of old white Ports made in São Luiz in the Douro Valley.
The house owns 125 hectares of land, 90 hectares of which are planted with vines, including many very old vines. Portuguese restaurant Bar Douro in London Bridge has helped to champion the white Port and tonic serve during the summer months in London.
Though given the price of Kopke’s new release, it may be deemed sacrilegious to mix it with tonic.

Andrew Clarke, owner of Jinks Creek winery, fled the Bunyip State Park Fire in Australian state of Victoria, which is currently burning an area of 11,524 hectares, according to the latest statement. 
Speaking on Nine Network’s Today programme, the winemaker said that he believed he’d seen his property, which includes a wine bar, gallery and accommodation, go up in flames in footage broadcast on Sunday 3 March.
He said: “I don’t want to see the devastation, but I am going to have to face up to it, we lost our entire … it is my life’s work and we have lost our cellar door which we built over many years.
“I suppose everyone can imagine seeing your house go up in flames, I mean with all your clothes in it – you don’t realise what possessions you have got until they are gone. It is all gone.
“My insurance won’t cover it, there is no way, my livelihood’s in tatters. I don’t have any way of earning any money, I don’t know what to do, I have got to support my family, so I’m stuffed pretty much.”
Clarke told the programme that he’d just purchased brewing equipment from Germany. He estimated that all of the gear destroyed in the blaze was worth around half a million (Australian) dollars.
He laid blame for the ferocity of the fires with Parks Victoria, which he claims were not following the rules “of the Royal Commission” and had not been doing any “burning off”.
Clarke has worked for the likes of Brown Brothers and Rick Kinzbrunner of Giaconda as well as Dry Creek in Sonoma and Château Giscours in Bordeaux. In 1979, he was the second recipient of a winemaking scholarship from the Victorian Wine Industry Association and in 1984, he set up his own viticultural consultancy business.
The first acre of vines at Jinks Creek, consisting of equal parts Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, was planted in 1979. It has since expanded to over eight acres with Sauvignon Blanc planted in the 1990s. Clarke now oversees 10 vineyards, ranging in size from 1 acre to 50 acres.
A Go Fund Me page has been set up in support of the Clarke family. To visit, please click here.
According to a statement from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, persistent periods of significant heat in December and January have resulted in the country’s warmest summer on record.
Bureau climatologist Dr Lynette Bettio, said: “The heat we saw this summer was unprecedented. While the final numbers are yet to be analysed, we know it will be the warmest on record for Australia as a whole, and many individual locations will have broken summer heat records as well.
“There was a noticeable absence of strong cold fronts that would normally bring relief during summer. Rainfall was also well below average for many places, apart from areas in northern Queensland.”
With severe weather events, including bushfires, to contend with, the AU$6 billion Australian wine industry is starting to feel the effects of the hot weather.
Speaking to CBS News, Andrew Margan, winemaker at Hunter Valley’s Margan Wines, said: “The difference this year is that the grapes are ripening quicker, so we’re harvesting earlier.
“There’s a compression of vintage so that historically, the white varieties would ripen at different times and now they’re all ripening together.
“So we’re looking at picking reds two weeks earlier than we normally would as well, and Shiraz in particular.”
With all the grapes coming in at once rather than in more manageable stages, wineries are faced with storage pressures and a struggle to find tank space.

Familia Torres and Jackson Family Wines have joined together to create a working group of wineries to help further efforts to decarbonise the wine industry and mitigate the impact of climate change.

Called International Wineries for Climate Action, the organisation’s key aim is to bring together the most environmentally committed wineries in the world in order to achieve an 80% reduction of total carbon emissions across the industry by 2045, which it says will help to mitigate and reverse the impacts of climate change.
Both family-owned wineries are looking to create a space for collaboration that encourages the sharing of best practices that reduce the impact of a changing climate in the vineyard and in winery operations.
Membership will focus on wineries who recognise that climate change is the most significant threat facing the wine industry and who are guided by the “urgency for strategic action that accelerates the implementation of innovative solutions to tackle climate change”, a release states.
Miguel A. Torres, president at of Bodegas Torres and fourth generation family member
Spanish winery Bodegas Torres is among the most active wineries in the world when it comes to tackling climate change, having already invested more than €12 million in green initiatives since 2008.
In 2008, Torres launched its Torres & Earth project with the aim of reducing its carbon emissions per bottle by 30% by 2020, with the ultimate aim of becoming carbon neutral. As of 2017, it had invested around €12m in renewable energy and green initiatives, with Miguel Torres allocating 11% of the company’s profits each year to the development of the programme to ensure its continuation.
Speaking to the drinks business in 2017, Miguel A. Torres, president at of Bodegas Torres and fourth generation family member, said: “The wine sector has in its own hands the capacity to lead the adoption of CO2 capture and reuse technologies to considerably reduce emissions.
“This certainly involves a change of paradigm and is a long, necessary and viable road towards achieving a zero-emissions winery within 10 to 15 years.”
US-based Jackson Family Wines meanwhile has long championed green initiatives, winning this year’s Water Management Award at the 2018 Drinks Business Green Awards.
It has already reduced its water consumption by around 34%, saving around 31 million gallons of water a year since 2008, while simultaneously boosting production.
Investing in vineyard water conservation, it also captures rainwater for the cooling towers and reuses winery water for irrigation, measures that have enabled the company to use only 3.9 gallons of water to produce a gallon of water – around half the amount of the US industry average.
Both Jackson and Torres have reduced their carbon emissions by more than 25% per bottle since they started auditing their respective carbon footprints.
Chairman and owner of Jackson Family Wines, Barbara Banke
This new collaboration between the two wineries will start with establishing a framework to understand and measure progress towards the defined goal, involving three key points: to establish a baseline of current carbon emissions by conducting third-party verified annual greenhouse gas emissions inventories; to adopt the guidance established in 2015 through COP21 and the Paris Agreement to take a science-based approach to reducing emissions; and finally to use at least 20% renewable energy generated by on-site systems to offset winery energy consumption.
Katie Jackson, second-generation proprietor and senior vice president of corporate responsibility at Jackson Family Wines, said: “Our common goal is to move beyond conversations around the urgency of climate change by collaborating on scalable solutions to reduce our global industry’s carbon footprint.”
Miguel A. Torres added: “We are just at the beginning with our initiative, but we hope it will be a trigger, a boost for other wineries to join and accelerate or to start the implementation of carbon-emissions-reduction-programs.”

The 2016 vintage of Napa Valley super star, Screaming Eagle, has been released to soaring praise and at over £2,000 a bottle, but the 2017 may not be produced due to smoke taint.
The wine was released at US$3,000 (£2,325) a bottle and Liv-ex reported it was quickly being offered for £7,200 per three (so £28,800 per dozen).
Price and demand, as so often, is being driven by a number of factors. To begin with it’s a famous ‘cult’ Californian label made in small quantities which helps drive interest.
In this instance the 2016 has also received some very good scores. Lisa Perrotti-Brown MW gave it a 98-100 range last October and suggested her final score would be at the “upper most end of the range”.
Antonio Galloni thrilled to it too. “Positively stunning,” he said and gave it 100 points.
It’s price is of course expensive but set against the context of its back vintages looks relatively reasonable, being less expensive than the 2007, 2010, 2012 and 2015 vintages which all have 100 points from The Wine Advocate (and which the 2016 may yet get as well) and also cheaper than several other vintages which don’t have as high a critical score.
Furthermore, it was revealed by Perrotti-Brown in her report that smoke taint from the California wildfires of 2017 has prompted the estate to consider not producing either Screaming Eagle or second wine ‘Second Flight’.
Winemaker Nick Gislason told Perrotti-Brown that only a “tiny pre-fire” harvest had been brought in when the smoke descended and once it had passed the estate dropped all the remaining fruit.
He said that any wine the estate might produce from that small harvest, “may not be released at all if it does not meet our quality standards”.
With positive scores and the prospect of no to extremely little stock being released next year, the estate is the one in position to call the shots in the here and now.

"db‘s Phoebe French heads to Bottles & Battles in Italian food market Mercato Metropolitano for a quirky, skin-contact white from Hungary, a wonderfully aromatic Amarone, and fresh pappardelle with sausage ragu."," 1st March, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/03/db-drinks-bottles-battles/,"1st March, 2019

db‘s Phoebe French heads to Bottles & Battles in Italian food market Mercato Metropolitano for a quirky, skin-contact white from Hungary, a wonderfully aromatic Amarone, and fresh pappardelle with sausage ragu.
The concept: Bottles & Battles, based in London food market Mercato Metropolitano, was established in 2016 by Italian food and wine aficionados Franco Mancini and Daniele Marano. With its heart firmly in Italy, the drinking den offers an array of bottles from different regions, as well as smattering of options from France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, South Africa, Hungary, Argentina, Chile and New Zealand.
Housed in a side room off one of the main eating halls, Bottles & Battles boasts an impressive by-the-glass list starting, with prices starting from £5.50, including some from the Coravin. The list is then divided into sections by region (northern, central and southern Italy) with other Old World and New World expressions thrown in for good measure. The focus here is on creating a relaxed, informal environment in which to enjoy and learn more about the inexhaustible range of native Italian grapes.
The wine sits alongside a well-priced range of Italian bites, from nibbles right the way through to a hearty beef stew. Bottles & Battles is a place you can pop into for a small plate and a glass of white, or somewhere to while away the hours in the evening with a bottle of wine and a good meal.
Celebrating its third year in business, Mercato Metropolitano occupies a large 45,000sqft site in what was a disused paper factory. In between Borough and Elephant & Castle, it was intended to evoke the vast food halls in Milan and Turin – indeed its founder, Andrea Rasca, was involved in Italian marketplace concept Eataly, which has sites in Chicago, New York, Bologna, Stockholm and and Munich.
The décor: While the interior of Bottles & Battles is calm and collected, the exterior is anything but. Housed in side room off one of the large market halls, approaching the venue is a sensory assault, the eye drawn to large charcuterie displays, wood-fired, pleasantly-charred pizzas and a counter bursting with different flavours of gelato. 
Confusingly, each outlet has identical black billboard-style signs, listing the type of food or drink being served, rather than the name of the business operating the stand. There’s no ‘Bottles & Battles’ logo on the outside, but rather two white neon signs, one reading ‘wine bar’, the other ‘enoteca’.
Once you’ve found the place, everything is far more straightforward. On one side, the bar is lined with a bottle display, the shelves built using wooden wine boxes. In the centre stands a long central table with swivel stools adorned with faux-fur throws, with a couple of sofas surrounding a lower table at the back. On the other side is a tiny hatch through to the kitchen with industrial-chic caged lights hanging from the ceiling, emitting a cozy winter glow.
The drinks: With 11 whites, 13 reds, 2 rosés and 2 sparkling wines available on the glass, there’s plenty to choose from if you’re unwilling to splash out on a bottle. Not that the bottles are pricey – ranging from £25 to £120, this list very reasonably priced. Highlights included Huba Szeremley’s Badacsony Kéknyelű – Kéknyelű being the grape variety – a quirky skin-contact white, and at 13 years old, a snip at £10 a glass.
For something slightly more mainstream, try the Tenuta Terre Nobili’s Greco di Calabria ‘Santa Chiara’ 2016, a crisp, fresh white with flavours of grapefruit and orange blossom for £8 a glass. In the red department, Antolini’s Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso 2016, a blend of Corvina, Corvionone and Rondinella, hit the spot, providing notes of black cherry, plum jam and cloves.
Signature sips: At the top of the by-the-glass list, there’s a ‘sommelier’s choice’ sip, currently Eugenio Rosi’s Marzemino ‘Poiema’, a biodynamic wine made with 100% Marzemino using 30% raisined grapes, with flavours of “ripe cherry, raspberry, almond and cigar smoke”.
Stand-outs from my trip included Zampaglione Fiano Campania ‘Don Chisciotte’ available for £11 a glass from the Coravin selection. Another skin-contact white, this had more stone fruit flavours than the Hungarian Kéknyelű (which more resembled Riesling) with flavours of white peach and hay. Also worth a try is Terre di Gnirega’s Amarone della Valpolicella, £17 a glass via Coravin. While slightly on the steep side, it’s worth it for the aroma alone, a complex mix of fruitcake, tobacco, dried rose petals and figs.
The food: While to some wine bars, food is an after-thought, at Bottles & Battles it’s definitely worth ordering a plate. From bowls of sweet and briney Nocellara olives to more substantial plates of fresh pasta, the food is simple and well-flavoured, with nibbles starting at £3.50, pasta at £9.50 and the most expensive hot dish, Robata BBQ onglet steak with vegetables coming in at £12.50. An impressive array of cheese and charcuterie is also available, priced at £15 for a sharing platter for two people, to £65 for six to 10 people.
Highlights from my visit included the pappardelle with sausage ragu with a liberal crumbling of pungent Parmesan over the top, and the burrata with caramelised pears and bread, the cream from the cheese combining with the sweet pear juices to form a moreish puddle in which to dip crusty slices of bread.
Don’t leave without: trying the liqueurs. We were served two sips from producers Rossa and Pure Sardinia, served up in elegant, tall-stemmed tulip glasses. Choose from Rossa’s blood orange and wild herb or Pure Sardinia’s wild myrtle liqueur. 
Last word: If you can negotiate the vast cavern that is Mercato Metropolitano, Bottles & Battles is a real find. A 10-15 minute walk from London Bridge, it’s a handy place to know if you’re searching for something off the beaten track. Staff are friendly and knowledgable, providing a welcome guide through a wine list brimming with unusual grape varieties.
The concept is clearly a success as founders Mancini and Marano opened a second site in Spitalfields Market last year, called Bottles. For those in search of laid-back surroundings, interesting wines, and who don’t mind sharing a table, Bottle & Battles is a safe bet.

Chef Tom Kerridge of two Michelin-starred pub Hand and Flowers and London steak restaurant Hawksmoor will join forces for the return of restaurant charity initiative A Good Dinner.
Huw Gott and Will Beckett, owners of Hawksmoor
The initiative raises money for three charities dedicated to reducing food and water poverty around the globe. Sponsored by Access Hospitality, A Good Dinner will return for a second time.
Established in 2017 by industry leaders including Will Beckett, co-founder of Hawksmoor and chairman of Rockfish Restaurants, and CMS Cameron McKenna Nabarro Chairman, David Roberts, A Good Dinner has raised crucial funds for Action Against Hunger, Magic Breakfast and The One Foundation.
Beckett said: “My colleagues and I have been so fortunate to have made our success in the world of food and drink, but the reality is that so many people are without access to food and safe water.”
The three-course dinner will be paired with a wine list curated by Bibendum, with cocktails from London cocktail bar Mr Foggs.
The event will also feature a silent auction, where guests will have the opportunity to win unique prizes gifted by businesses across the industry.
A Good Dinner will take place at Wild by Tart in Belgravia on 7 March. Further details regarding the event and how to purchase tickets can be found by contacting katy@agooddinner.org.uk

Hundreds of jobs are at risk following an announcement by the Boparan Restaurant Group that Giraffe and Ed’s Easy Diner will shut 27 of their combined 87 sites as part of a strategy to reduce company debts.
The “world kitchen” Giraffe and retro-style Ed’s Easy Diner will shut 27 of their 87 combined sites as part of a Company Voluntary Arrangement, a strategy businesses implement to reduce debts by paying creditors over a fixed period.
The Boparan Restaurant Group acquired Giraffe from Tesco in 2016, in two deals valued at around £23 million.
BRG later combined Giraffe with Ed’s Easy Diner, the two brands generating a combined annual turnover of £67.1 million.  In the same period, underlying losses came to £1.6 million.
Chief executive of BRG, Tom Crowley, said: “We have been examining options for the two brands for some time and the CVA is the only option to protect the company.  The combination of increasing costs and oversupply of restaurants in the sector, and a softening of consumer demand, have all contributed to the challenges both these brands face.”
The process will be handled by KPMG, an audit, tax and advisory services, with the proposal to be put to a creditor vote in March.
The company’s other brands, which include restaurant chains Slim Chickens and Harry Ramsden, and grocery brands Goodfella’s pizza and Fox’s biscuits, are believed to be unaffected by the decision.
BRG will join a number of well-known companies in the restaurant industry, including chains Byron Burger, Carluccio’s and Prezzo, who entered into CVAs last year.

With an elating playlist and flavour-packed dishes, Peckham’s Levan, the sister site of Salon in Brixton, offers a window onto France’s increasingly en vogue Jura region.
“The word, ‘Sommelier’ makes my skin crawl – it’s not the setting I’m in. I’m more like a ‘wine investigator’ trying to figure out what the hell people want!” says Mark Gurney, co-creator with Nicholas Balfe and Matt Bushnell of Levan in Peckham (formerly the trailblazing Peckham Refreshment Rooms) which is the sister site to Brixton’s Salon.
“We nearly called it Jura but thought people might confuse us with that lovely island off the coast of Scotland known for whisky,” says Gurney. “We also thought about calling it Trousseau, but Google revealed that as well as being a grape in the Jura along with Savagnin and Poulsard, a trousseau is the apparel a bride collects in anticipation of marriage…”
Using the same chunky typeface which appears on Jura wine bottles as their logo, Levan is a play on the words, “Le Vin” while paying homage to the late American DJ, Larry Levan, famous for his decade-long residency at New York City nightclub, Paradise Garage. Gurney pulls out a record of that name from a unit which also features a vinous line-up by Bénédicte et Stéphane Tissot – part of a three-page selection from the often steep Jura département between Burgundy and Switzerland. These are enthusiastically supplemented with “Jura varietals from around the world” including Patagonian Trousseau (Bodgea Miras).
Inspired by what Gurney refers to as the “bistronomy” movement and the team’s favourite haunts in Paris, Copenhagen, Barcelona, Stockholm and Berlin, punchy dishes may include silken house-cured sardines, monkfish crudo with ponzu and pickled chilli, particularly sumptuous truffled roast cauliflower with crisped kale and Parmesan, and impeccably raised Alpine cheeses such as Beaufort from Savoie with optional glass of Vin Jaune. Be sure to secure the blocks of Comte fries with saffron aioli, too.
Gurney, who recently sold a bottle of Flaccianello to Coldplay’s drummer at Levan, has never been a fan of the term, Fine Wine. “I feel it’s quite an exclusive term, but still love to offer interesting producers with older vintages who are, broadly, more ‘classic’ in style and approach. For example, we have a stunning super Tuscan 2004 Ornellaia on for the bargain price of £240. That would be £600-700 in most central London restaurants!”
Gurney’s tastes are ever evolving, “changing with my experience and exposure to new things. Those things can be people, places or culture and that’s the exciting part. I’m just as excited about discovering new young winemakers as I am about drinking old vintages of dusty Burgundy. I’m also really interested in regions undergoing a quiet renaissance. Bordeaux, Champagne, Cahors – with bags of history or a reputation for a certain old-school style. But who have a new-wave of winemakers breaking away from ‘traditional’ approaches. Super exciting!”
When not at Levan or Salon, you may well encounter Gurney winding down at The Winemakers Club, Westerns Laundry, or Nest, “a tiny place run by a young hungry team focusing on every part of an animal.” His girlfriend, Aimee Hartley is founding editor of the wine-led magazine, Above Sea Level, meanwhile.

The California Wine Institute is hosting the first of its two major London tastings in Shoreditch this month.

Called “Essential California”, the tasting will shine a light on wines priced at up to £50. Some 500 wines from 50 AVAs, including lesser known AVAs such as Potter Valley, Yolo County and Dunnigan Hills, will be on show at The Yard in Shoreditch on Wednesday 12 March.
Essential California will aim to dispel the myth that great Californian wines are always expensive. “In the past people may have spoken of Californian wine carrying a high price tag, however, these days we hear more and more about how high-quality California Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are actually excellent value compared to the rising prices of many Burgundies” said, Damien Jackman, trade director of the California Wine Institute.
“The deep interest in the UK market is demonstrated by the record number of Californian wineries looking for new import partners in the UK at this tasting, as well as the well-established icons of California like Jim Clendenen of Au Bon Climat also making the trip to be with us,” Jackman said.
In addition, the institute has partnered with Roth Bar & Grill to bring the produce from their Somerset farm to Shoreditch for a California style barbecue menu. Roth will be slow-cooking and grilling over wood all day and will be offering grilled salads, oak-plank salmon, chicken, lamb and beef tasting bites throughout the day – the perfect partner to those Essential California Wines.
Justine McGovern, Brand Director for California Wine Institute added: “The Yard in Shoreditch will be transformed from a blank canvas to a hub of all things California, we have a commissioned a California style mural, Californian cuisine, and of course the ultimate Eagles cover band to create the laid-back California mood.”
The second major tasting, Collectible California, will focus on wines retailing over £50 and will be hosted at the US Embassy in London, along with a private client dinner on 26 September.

As the founder of luxury drinks wholesaler Vanquish and co-founder of online drinks retailer 31Dover.com, Jimmy Metta knows a thing or two about the changing face of the UK drinks industry. Now he is bringing a new concept to market, with the launch of Spiritrade – a global drinks trading platform for spirits, beer, Champagne and non-alcoholic beverages, with the aim of creating an online trading community for drinks professionals.
Jimmy Metta
What’s Spiritrade all about, and how did you come up with the concept?

I have been in the industry for over 15 years and have always aimed to be at the forefront of drinks trading on a global scale. Throughout my experiences, I have come across many hurdles and found the industry to be very antiquated and open to many inefficiencies. My mission at Spiritrade is to create a unique marketplace, where buyers and sellers can trade in an environment which is efficient and secure.
Traders are often faced with the dilemma of whether or not to engage with new suppliers and markets. Spiritrade aims to alleviate many concerns faced by the trade daily. Our goal is to allow businesses greater opportunities and access to a new customer base from the around the world, thereby increasing their revenues streams and opportunities. Spiritrade is a trading platform for professionals in the drinks industry. Our technology designed by industry leaders, has been tailored to drinks industry needs and facilitates trades in an anonymous, safe and efficient environment.
What is your background in drinks?
My background comes from founding a luxury drinks wholesaler called Vanquish in 2004 and co-founding an online drinks retailer called 31Dover.com, both multiple award winning businesses. Vanquish was sold in 2017. These experiences have allowed me to gain the great acumen and experience needed to create a trading platform in the eyes of a trader.
What does Spiritrade offer that other drinks trading platforms do not?
There is simply no comparable trading platform to ours, we are the first drinks trading platform of its kind We have invested a great amount of time and capital in the development of the technology behind the platform. We partnered with a leading software development company, behind blue chip companies such as the London Stock Exchange and Eurostar, in order to create a state of the art trading platform which is user friendly, accessible and efficient. The benefits include safety and integrity throughout, we have introduced numerous security features which will ensure that our members are protected. All trades are anonymous, which allows our users full direction and greater freedom to trade. Spiritrade features a dedicated negotiation area and quick trading through the click of a button. Spiritrade is a safe community of industry professionals from around the world.
Who is the platform aimed at?
Spiritrade is aimed at all drinks professionals. Our members include wholesalers, cash and carries, brand owners and traders. We have had an excellent, global response from the trade since launching early February. It is evident that there is a great demand and need for our trading platform. The industry prior to Spiritrade’s launch, has been antiquated and open to counterfeit stock and rouge traders, as well as human error. Spiritrade has been designed to modernise and revolutionise the way that drinks are traded. Safety and integrity are at the forefront of our platform, as well as an automated system, in order to alleviate the mentioned concerns. We have received very strong feedback from our users, who find this tool useful to sell stock more efficiently and improve buying capabilities. Since our launch, multiple trades have been facilitated through our exchange.
How do you plan to monitor the authenticity of trades and the credibility of those selling wines and spirits on your platform?
All members are carefully selected and vetted, prior to being allowed access to Spiritrade. All members must pass a due diligence process, as safety is at the core of this business. Once members are allowed access on to the exchange, they can upload listings. Each listing is submitted for approval. The listing needs to meet our terms and conditions, and only then will it go live on to the exchange. Once a deal is agreed, funds are held in a trusted escrow facility. Stock is then shipped to the warehouse, where it is verified by a third party. Once approved, funds are then released from escrow. We believe that these numerous factors will ensure security and integrity throughout the trading process.
How has the drinks industry changed in the past five years?
The truth is our industry has struggled in terms of evolving and adapting with our times. The industry is still the same as it was when I started 15 years ago except suppliers are now trading more freely. With the rest of the world being so efficient, be it Uber for Transport, Alibaba for e-commerce, Deliveroo for food, I truly believe drinks industry must catch up with the times and modernise. There is an opportunity to make the industry run in a far more efficient and safe manner and traders should have access to opportunities and more revenue streams.
What do you hope to achieve in the first year, and what are your aims for the platform going forward?
I hope that Spiritrade becomes an indispensable tool for the trade and I truly hope that our members prosper and evolve through this process. Spiritrade was designed with the trader in mind, and naturally I want to see all members profit and grow through using our platform. Going forward, we aim to become a safe, global community of drinks industry professionals. Spiritrade aims to modernise the way that drinks are traded and ensure a more secure and efficient trading environment. Going forward we look to explore new markets around the world in our efforts to bring the drinks industry together.

"Net profits of Campari dropped by 16.8% in 2018, according to its full year 2018 results, but were buoyed by growing sales of Aperol, which in the UK alone grew by 56%."," 5th March, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/03/campari-net-profits-drop-17-as-uk-sales-of-aperol-rise-56/,"5th March, 2019

Net profits of Campari dropped by 16.8% in 2018, according to its full year 2018 results, but were buoyed by growing sales of Aperol, which in the UK alone grew by 56%.
Bob Kunze-Concewitz, chief executive officer of Campari
Announcing its full year results this morning, Campari reported total sales of €1.71 billion, representing organic growth of +5.3%, but a reported decline of -2.4%.
Gross profits increased to €1.02 billion, representing organic growth of 7.4% and reported growth of 1.6%.
EBIT was adjusted to €378.8 million, representing organic growth of 7.6% and reported drop of 0.4%, while group net profits fell 16.8% to €296.3 million on a reported basis, below analysts’ expectations.
“We achieved a solid performance across all key indicators in terms of organic growth and margin expansion in full year 2018, consistently delivering on long term strategy,” said Bob Kunze-Concewitz, chief executive officer of Campari.
“In particular, over the past four years Campari Group has achieved +680bps of gross margin expansion on sales on a cumulative basis, as the combined result of very healthy organic expansion of +390bps, driven by favourable sales mix, and accretive M&A initiatives, including strategic divestments, and FX contributing the remainder.
“This remarkable achievement has enabled strengthened investments in brand building and commercial initiatives for long-term, sustainable growth.”
The year saw Campari benefit from the selling-off of the Italian Lemonsoda business, generating €80.2m, and also acquire Cognac producer Bisquit for €52.7m.
The Americas
By region, the Americas, which accounts for 43.5% of the group’s sales, showed positive organic growth of 6.7%, driven by the double-digit growth of Espolòn, Aperol and Campari, as well as the positive trends of Wild Turkey, Grand Marnier and the Jamaican rums.
This result helped offset the decline in SKYY vodka, which continued to be affected by de-stocking.
“SKYY sales registered an organic change of -8.1%, due to weakness in the US market, as the brand continues to be impacted by de-stocking activity, with the gap between the brand’s sales and more positive consumption data progressively reducing, as well as continued strong competitive pressure and reduced innovation in infusions,” the producer said.
“In the international markets, the positive results achieved in Argentina, Australia, China, Mexico, Italy and the UK offset the declines in Brazil, Global Travel Retail and Germany.”
Sales of Aperol grew by 56% in the UK alone in 2018
Europe, Africa and the Middle East
Sales in Southern Europe, Middle East and Africa (accounting for 28% of total sales) reported organic growth of 4.9%. Italy in particular registered a “very solid organic growth” of 3.6%, driven by the double-digit growth in Aperol (+15.3%) and Campari (+7.4%), as well as positive trends in Braulio, Espolòn and SKYY, which offset weaker sales of Crodino, Campari Soda and Cinzano sparkling wines, the producer said.
Sales in North, Central and Eastern Europe (21% of group sales) increased by 3.4%.
Sales in the UK (1.9% of total group sales) registered an organic growth of +19.1%, driven by Aperol (+56.0%), Campari (+39.3%), Bulldog (+24.8%), Appleton Estate (+25.4%) and Wray&Nephew Overproof (+12.6%).
Sales in Germany reported organic growth of 6.5%, mainly driven by Aperol (+22.6%) and Campari (+13.9%), as well as the positive trends from Bulldog and Grand Marnier.
Asia Pacific
Asia Pacific (which accounts for just 7.5% of Campari’s sales) reported the biggest growth of 12.9%, driven by Wild Turkey bourbon, Espolòn, GlenGrant, SKYY, Campari and Frangelico.
“Looking ahead into 2019, our outlook remains fairly balanced in terms of risks and opportunities as uncertainty around macroeconomic instability and currency volatility, particularly in emerging markets, remain,” added Kunze-Concewitz.
“We expect the current underlying business performance to keep its momentum, while we continue facing headwinds from agave purchase price hike. Nevertheless, we remain confident in achieving a positive performance across the key underlying business indicators in 2019, driven by the continued outperformance of the high-margin Global & Regional priority brands in key developed markets.”
Overall, net financial debt stood at €846.3 million as of December 31 2018, down from €981.5 million on 31 December 2017. The Italian spirits maker proposed a dividend of €0.05 per share for 2018, leaving it unchanged with the year before.

"A new phylloxera outbreak has been detected within a commercial vineyard in Australia’s Yarra Valley, within a currently designated Phylloxera Risk Zone."," 5th March, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/03/new-phylloxera-outbreak-detected-in-victoria/,"5th March, 2019

A new phylloxera outbreak has been detected within a commercial vineyard in Australia’s Yarra Valley, within a currently designated Phylloxera Risk Zone.
The phylloxera pest can be devastating to vineyards
This most recent outbreak was detected by Vinehealth Australia and Australian Grape and Wine Inc (Australian Grape & Wine) at a vineyard located in St Andrews in the Yarra Valley.
The strain of phylloxera detected has been confirmed as G1; the same as that found in the Maroondah PIZ (Phylloxera Infested Zone), also located in the Yarra Valley.
A 5km quarantine area is now in place around the infested vineyard, which abuts the north west boundary of the existing Maroondah PIZ.
Work is currently underway by Agriculture Victoria to establish a new PIZ in light of this latest outbreak (see map below), in accordance with the National Phylloxera Management Protocol.
“This latest phylloxera outbreak in Victoria is a concerning development,” said Vinehealth Australia CEO, Inca Pearce.
“It highlights the critical role that industry must play in preventing further spread. The outbreak is also clear evidence of the need for a new national management strategy for phylloxera, on which work has recently commenced. We need to do everything in our power to protect our vines and manage the risk.”
Phylloxera is an insect pest that can have a devastating impact on grapevines, affecting Vitis species. There are currently 83 endemic strains in Australia that are confined to a number of wine regions in parts of Victoria and New South Wales, representing a “major threat” to the vast majority of Australia’s vineyards that are planted on own roots, which are highly susceptible to attack by the pest.
Australian Grape & Wine CE, Tony Battaglene adds: “Pests and diseases are a major risk to the Australian wine sector. Managing this risk should remain a high priority for all grape and wine producers and Australian Grape & Wine is committed to raising biosecurity awareness across the sector.”
The newly detected outbreak. Credit: Agriculture Victoria
The organisation is urging winemakers in the region to be vigilant and to ensure preventative measures are in place to prevent the movement of pests, diseases and weeds, including phylloxera, as part of their shared responsibility for biosecurity.
This includes implementing strict farm gate hygiene practices to prevent the entry of phylloxera or other pests, diseases and weeds into your vineyard, as well as recording the wine regions where all visitors to your site (including their machinery/equipment) have been in the past three weeks, so that you can assess the risk they pose to your vines by determining whether they have been in a PIZ or PRZ.
Australian grapegrowing regions are delineated by phylloxera status into three management zones:

Phylloxera Exclusion Zones (PEZ) have been surveyed and found free or are declared free historically.
Phylloxera Risk Zones (PRZ) are of unknown status.
Phylloxera Infested Zones (PIZ) contain vineyards known to be or have been infested.

Six new Masters of Wine named
The Institute of Masters of Wine announced six new Masters of Wine, from six different countries last month, taking the total number of people to hold the title worldwide to 384.
The new Masters of Wine are Edouard Baijot MW (France), Nicholas Jackson MW (USA), Brendan Jansen MW (Australia), Jonas Röjerman MW (Sweden), Harriet Tindal MW (Ireland – above) and Jonas Tofterup MW (Spain).
The MW examination consists of three stages and culminates in the submission of a final research paper, an in-depth study on a wine-related topic from any area of the sciences, arts, humanities, or social sciences.
In addition to passing the examination, all MWs are required to sign the MW code of conduct before they are entitled to use the initials MW. The code of conduct requires MWs to act with honesty and integrity and to use every opportunity to share their understanding of wine with others.
There are now 384 MWs in the world, based in 30 countries. The new MWs will be formally welcomed to the IMW at a ceremony in London later this year.

John Shafer, the owner of Shafer Vineyards in Stags Leap and a veteran of Napa’s wine industry, has died at the age of 94.
John Shafer of Shafer Vineyards in Napa
John Shafer died on 2 March, Shafer Vineyards confirmed with a statement, in which it paid tribute to a father, longtime vintner, philanthropist and winery founder.
“The world of wine always inspired Dad and he loved nothing more than to work with the Shafer team to improve quality, enhance everything we do, and to discuss future projects,” said Doug Shafer, president, Shafer Vineyards, who worked with his father since 1983.
“He also loved Napa Valley, worked to make it a better place for everyone, and we’re receiving amazing messages from a huge number of people whose lives he touched with his generous spirit.”
Shafer was born in 1924 and spent most of his childhood in Glencoe, Illinois, a small suburb of Chicago. At age 17 he volunteered for service in World War II, joined the Army Air Corps, and piloted a B-24 bomber over Germany. After the war he earned an engineering degree from Cornell University and later moved into publishing, starting as a salesman and eventually rising to the position of vice president of long range planning at educational publishing house Scott, Foresman & Co. in Chicago.
In 1973, at the age of 48, he moved to Napa Valley, purchasing a vineyard at the base of Stags Leap palisades, and became part of a groundbreaking generation of Napa vintners.
Shafer replanted the original 30 acres of vineyards and then began establishing new Cabernet Sauvignon vines on the hillsides. In 1978 he produced the first Shafer Vineyards wine, a Cabernet Sauvignon sourced from the first newly planted block of hillside vines. That wine was released in 1981, setting a benchmark for future Shafer hillside Cabernets, and was the forerunner of the winery’s signature wine, Hillside Select.
In 1985 Shafer organised a cohort of his his  his neighbouring vintners and grape growers, including Nathan Fay, Warren Winiarski, Dick Steltner, and Joseph Phelps, to petition the government to designate their region as an official American Viticultural Area (AVA). Four years later approval was granted, making Stags Leap District Napa Valley’s third AVA. Today it is considered one of the world’s top regions for cultivating Cabernet Sauvignon.
John Shafer is predeceased by son Bill Shafer, who died in 2000, his first wife Betty Shafer Wells in 2007, and his second wife Barbara Shafer, who died in 2016.
He is survived by daughter Libby Shafer of St. Helena, sons Doug Shafer of St. Helena, and Brad Shafer of San Francisco, 13 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

English drinks producer Chapel Down is to launch a pink gin made with Pinot Noir grape distillate this month, which it claims is the first gin to be made using the grape variety.
Housed in a dusty rose bottle, the Pinot Noir Gin follows the same formula as the producer’s previous releases – Bacchus Gin and Chardonnay Vodka – that were unveiled back in November 2017. Billed as the world’s first Pinot Noir gin, the grape distillate is then blended with English wheat spirit.
Produced using grape skins leftover from wine production, the gin joins the limited-edition spirit range called ‘The Spirit of Chapel Down’. It is now available for an exclusive launch period in Selfridges, and direct from the Chapel Down website, and will soon be available more widely in both the on- and off-trade.
The spirit range is packaged in 70cl, custom-made glass bottles designed to represent both distilling and winemaking, for which last year, Chapel Down picked up the award for best design and packaging at The Drinks Business Awards. The bottom half of the bottle is finished in clear cut-glass while the top half is frosted and “denotes the classic shape of a wine bottle”.
The Chapel Down Pinot Noir Gin is bottled at 41.2% ABV and is available for an RRP of £35.
Chapel Down head winemaker, Josh Donaghay-Spire, who created the new gin, said: “Not only have we made use of the skins, we’ve added additional complexity by matching the botanicals with the characteristics of the Pinot Noir grape.
“This means the gin is infused with juniper, coriander, dried red berries, rose buds, citrus fruits, rosehip, angelica and grains of paradise, all of which brilliantly reflect Pinot Noir.
“The result is an aromatic pink gin with delicate aromas of red berries which perfectly balance the juniper led palate and refreshing citrus finish.”
Mark Harvey, managing director of Chapel Down Wine & Spirits says, “Chapel Down Pinot Noir Gin has all the attributes to become a superstar product within our range. There is a subtlety of flavour which has surprised and delighted all that have tasted this gin so far. Unique and delicious, a fantastic new addition to the family!”
Chapel Down has recently unveiled its gin bar and distillery called Gin Works in London’s King’s Cross. It also is scheduled to open its brewery under its Curious Drinks brand in Ashford next month. Housing its beer and cider operation, the new brewery will include a restaurant and shop and will form part of multi-million regeneration project in the area.

Pesticides and other artificial chemicals used in conventional winemaking should be listed as ingredients on the end product, according to a French MW leading the charge for a low intervention revolution.

The debate on certifications for natural, organic and biodynamic wines has been rumbling in France for some time. Last summer, a member of one of the country’s far-right political parties attempted to launch a consultation to create a blueprint for a legal definition of natural wine. Sales of organic wines have risen in UK supermarkets within the past two years, and in the on-trade, companies like Bibendum are making more of an effort to educate their customers on eco-friendly alternatives. But as it stands, many are put off by the lack of official standards in eco-friendly vinification and viticulture, with critics such as US-born Robert Parker calling the movement an “undefined scam“.
There are discrepancies, too, in the requirements for some wineries to label their products as organic. In the US, wines labelled ‘organic’ cannot contain added sulphites. Wines that have added sulphites but are otherwise organic, are labelled ‘wine made from organic grapes’. In the UK, however, the wine only needs to come from organic fruit to receive accreditation.
The EU has strict guidelines on organic and biodynamic farming, but separate countries within the union have rules of their own, which leaves room for interpretation. A radical solution would be to do away with traditional guidelines and make all producers list whatever they use.
“It is important that ‘natural wine’ be protected by law,” Isabelle Legeron, France’s first female Master of Wine, tells the drinks business, “but it is actually just as important, and probably more so, that non-natural producers be clearly identifiable as well. In fact, if this were the case then there would be no need to categorise natural wines per se as labelling would speak for itself.”
Legeron is the founder of London’s RAW Wine Fair, an annual trade and consumer-focused event for producers in the industry who prioritise eco-friendly practices. It welcomes a wide range of industry folk with varying approaches to viticulture, whether its swapping out chemicals for copper in the vineyard, sowing local wildflowers between the vines, or cutting down on sulphates in the winery. The only strict rule is that they must be making the effort to change conventional practices.
Conventional wines, made with pesticide-sprayed grapes, are damaging to the health of those that grow them as well as to those that drink them, she said. Legeron is working closely with Olivier Paul-Morandini, founder of the Transparency for Organic Wine Association (TOWA), to campaign for more transparency on the winemaking process at an EU-wide level. Both Legeron Morandini’s team of researchers agree that pesticides are damaging to everyone from the consumer to the insects they repel.
Not everyone agrees that farming with chemical repellents is harmful. A recent scientific study in the US found traces of a herbicide commonly used in weed killer in several leading wine and beer brands. While the scale of their reach may be alarming, an adult would need to consume “140 glasses of wine a day containing the highest glyphosate level measured just to reach the level that California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has identified as ‘No Significant Risk Level’”, acording to a spokesperson for the Wine Institute.

That said, the TOWA research team claim that quantity is not the issue. In France in particular, neurological disease, inflammatory diseases, and chronic illnesses such as asthma face a steady increase. “To blame, mainly, are pesticides,” a spokesperson said.
“Modern toxicology teaches us that it’s not the amount one consumes that makes it harmful.” TOWA claims that there are many factors besides the sheer volume of wine consumption that can affect the average drinker, such as the period of exposure to toxins over the course of one’s life, the duration of each exposure, or “the fusion of different potent molecules.”
Even weaker dosages can still create a “cocktail effect”, according to the lobbying body. Pesticides, it said, can be detected in human DNA for as many as three generations “even in situations where the descendants have never come into direct contact with the pollutant.”
“We need better labelling laws for alcohol,” Legeron told db, “and mentions of pesticides and herbicides used in the growing of the plants should also be mandatory as well. Only then will consumers have real, informed choice.”
It is a policy that Legeron takes seriously at her own event. All producers exhibiting at the fair fair, which will run from Sunday to Monday to coincide with #rawwineweek (6-13 March), have to submit sulphite analyses, and growers have to list any additives and/or aids used in their making.
More than 150 natural wine producers from around the world will be converging on London in March for the next Raw Wine Fair, including Gut Oggau, Château Le Puy and Domaine Tawse.

Our recent explorations into the wider reaches of the market, with particular reference to Burgundy, have given rise to a lot of enquiries about whether there is any secondary market light at the end of the tunnel for a vast range of esoteric wines that unsuspecting people have been sold as “investments” in the past.

We talk a lot about risk in our discussions about the fine wine market for the profoundly important reason that the concept of risk, and its management, is fundamental to the investment process. At Amphora we offer an investment proposition, not a blind foray into wine ownership. As a result when we go off piste we make it very clear both that we are doing so, and why, and that any resultant risk is under control.
Yet we constantly see collections of wines whose secondary market has never seen the light of day, and which often dominate those portfolios to an alarming degree. Well of course its not alarming at all if the objective is to drink them one day, but it is absolutely catastrophic if you are hoping to make a nice investment return.
Many of the victims of situations like this have no idea what the lack of a secondary market means. The fact of the matter is that the fine wine market is sufficiently illiquid even at the most tradeable end that most merchants will bid a double-digit discount to their offer price for any seller in need of a cash transaction. That is not in any way unfair, by the way, it simply reflects the fact that the merchants are going “on risk”, meaning that they may not be able to find a buyer at the price at which they would hope to sell.
We used to have a client whose main business was second hand car dealing, and there was no-one more vociferous about pricing, yet the two situations are very much analogous. We would ask him if he might ever buy a car and put it out on the forecourt at the same price. It simply does not happen, and the reason is that he is providing a service for which he justifiably expects to get paid. That payment comes in the spread between what he buys a car for, and the price at which he sells it.
Merchants operate in the same way, so let me make as clear as possible the fact of life that unless you are paying someone a fee for conducting a transaction for you in a physical good of any kind, they are taking a spread. Even in a world as liquid as foreign exchange anyone offering you a “commission free” transaction is taking your eyes out on the spread. People like M&S and the Post Office even advertise the fact through their “we buy at… we sell at” rate notices.
Some wines, of course, are more tradeable than others, so the spread is reduced even to single figures on occasion, but if you are trying to offload a magnum of something perfectly desirable like Le Pin, you are exposed as to whether your counterparty (usually a merchant) really wants it (lower spread), or not (higher spread).
How we at Amphora address this is to try and operate more of a willing buyer willing seller arrangement in an attempt to trade within the spread, and while this is not always possible we do often manage a preferential deal for both parties than if they were exposed to a spread. The problem arises when you can’t find hide or hair of a buyer.
“But isn’t it your job to find a buyer?”
The answer to that question reflects our position as an investment house rather than a retailer. An investment house by definition can only deal in investment grade wines, and this is where we still find a degree of confusion. “Investment grade” is not synonymous with “fine wine”, by which we mean that it is perfectly possible to have a wine which improves over time as it ages in the bottle (the customary definition of a “fine wine”), but for which there is simply no ready secondary market.
To be clear: investment grade = fine wine + secondary market. 
We apologise to all readers who may already know this, but our experience is that “investors” are constantly hoodwinked into parting with money in exchange for something which there is absolutely no guarantee of their being able to sell. As a result from time to time we feel it important to reinforce the message.
As the fine wine market expands more and more wines are becoming tradable, so it is perfectly possible for people to get lucky and end up with a wine which has suddenly found a secondary market, and thereby make a profit which would have been denied a buyer of the same wine in the past. The market is evolving and as it grows and more people become interested in it the number of new wines making the grade increases, which is all to the good.
The fact remains, however, that at this point there are more fine wines failing the investment grade test than passing it, and an investor in this market place needs to be aware of this. There is even a very coherent way of playing the potential for wines to make the grade, and that is by allowing them to be absorbed within a portfolio of “safer harbour” wines which you know you can easily sell. We call this mitigating your risk.
The bottom line is that we would prefer investors only be exposed to market risk. “Known unknowns” tend to be a lot less damaging than “unknown unknowns”, yet it is the latter which confound most portfolios that are sent to us for audit or review, and by far the biggest torpedo results from the absence of a secondary market for many of the wines.

Nigel Greening, the owner of Felton Road, has told db that he hopes a secondary market doesn’t emerge for Central Otago Pinots and that he’s “disgusted” by the prices certain wines command today.
Autumnal vines at Felton Road
Speaking to the drinks business during the Central Otago Pinot Celebration in Queenstown, Greening revealed his aversion to the idea that his prized Pinots may one day be regularly traded on the secondary market.
“I honestly hope a secondary market doesn’t emerge for our wines. When it comes to Felton Road, there are customers with allocations that aren’t prepared to sell them. There is a significant buying market for the wines but not a selling market. We sell our Block 3 and Block 5 Pinots for £50, which is not high enough to make them worth selling on.
“I’m disgusted by the prices some wines can command today, it’s shameful. And it has nothing to do with wine. I won’t put my prices up as it’s not a competition – wine is not a competitive sport. It’s ludicrous some of the prices people are charging for their wines. There will always be rock star wines like DRC and Coche-Dury, but a middle of the road premier cru Burgundy can now command £1,000 a dozen, which they won’t get away with it in the long term.
Nigel Greening with Felton Road winemaker Blair Walter
“Central Otago wines are respected all over the world but I don’t want it to become the next Napa Valley,” Greening said.
Just yesterday db reported that the 2016 vintage of Screaming Eagle had gone on sale at US$3,000 (£2,325) a bottle and was being sold on Liv-ex for £7,200 per three.
Greening told db that he believes there is no longer a signature Central Otago Pinot style, as sub-regional character and nuance is starting to show in the wines.
“I don’t think there is a signature Central Otago Pinot Noir style today. There was in the past when producers were making big, indulgently fruity, higher alcohol wines. They had a lot of puppy fat on them but the wines are finding their own style now, which is much harder to nail down.
“Distinctive styles from the sub-regions are starting to emerge. The Pinots from Bendigo are like the wines from Corton – broad shouldered and muscular, as it’s on a big hill that catches the wind.
“The Pinots from Alexandra are bright and vivid, with a dried herb character. It’s not too early to talk about sub-regional differences because they’re happening. We’re unweaving the rainbow in Central Otago at the moment and winemaker influences are falling back,” Greening said.
He views the recent high profile acquisitions in the region as a good thing.
“There has been a lot of change in Central Otago over the last few years with some of the smaller estates being sold to larger players, local or otherwise, which I view as a positive thing as it’s good to have smaller domaines with greater professionalism.
“There are huge changes taking place in viticulture too – people are pulling back on fruit and picking earlier. Increasing vine age means the quality of the wine is getting better, and we’re working with better plant material,” Greening told db.
He did however warn that grape growers and vineyard owners need to take better care of their vines.
“A lot of really good land isn’t getting the care and attention a grand cru site needs. Our vineyards will come to be devalued if we don’t give more care and attention to them. We’ve yet to get to the point of distinguishing between really good sites and great sites. A lot of vines in Central Otago are on their own roots, which is risky due to the threat of phylloxera,” he said.
“Two thirds of our Block 3 vines are on their own roots, but we’re steadily replanting it, which is a gradual process,” he added.

The deal, which will see Didsbury’s raspberry and Elderflower pink gin offered in 775 Wetherspoon’s pubs across the UK, will give the distiller exposure to the pub chain’s two million weekly patrons.
Didsbury’s pink gin will be stocked in all of JD Wetherspoon’s Pubs from 6 March.
“It’s great to see Wetherspoon’s championing new young British businesses and showing the same belief and passion for our products as we do, this will be a great partnership,” Manton said. “They have been very supportive throughout the procurement process and we are thrilled to be working with them on such a large scale.”
The team at Didsbury Gin were originally approached by Wetherspoons to take part in their gin festival, which is currently running at selected sites across Britain.
The deal comes soon after Didsbury Gin’s appearance on hit BBC Two show Dragons’ Den, where founders Liam Manton and Mark Smallwood formed a partnership with Jenny Campbell in a £75,000 deal.
Co-founder Smallwood added that the pair “have been working hard behind the scenes since the show was recorded last April to put some great deals into place.”
The boss of UK pub chain JD Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, an outspoken supporter of Brexit, recently removed all European wines and beers from its 900 pubs in favour of bottles from the UK, US, Australia and Chile.

The average spend per bottle has increased at a level significantly above inflation, rising 9% per year between 2015 and 2018 in the UK premium on-trade, a new report by Liberty Wines has found.

Liberty Wines’ Premium On-Trade Report 2019 has revealed that while on-trade alcohol volumes are continuing to fall, value remains resistant.
The report also found that the average bottle is 60% higher in restaurants in the premium on-trade than outside, and this is growing at a rate of 3% year-on-year.
Compiled in partnership with data expert CGA, the report looks at the reasons behind wines sales in premium on-trade outlets across the country. Analysing restaurants, hotels, gastropubs and wine bars the report refers to market data compiled between July 2017 and June 2018, unless otherwise stated.
CGA has looked at data from 119,616 on-trade outlets in the UK and matched it with sales data from Liberty Wines. The top 5,900 outlets (5%) constitute the premium segment. The report also includes consumer research compiled with responses from over 1,000 premium wine drinkers.
Liberty’s report noted that restaurants have a higher market share by value (28%) than their share of physical outlets (21%). It noted that alcohol volume sales were falling at a greater rate than value (-5% compared to -2%).
It attributed this to the “highly-trained” staff at restaurants being able to “convey the stories and personalities behind complex and unusual wines more effectively than in other on-trade outlets.” Wine lists at premium restaurants boast the highest number of wines from different countries, which the wine distributer says, “reflects their focus on hand-selling and staff education.”
Among the higher-priced wines sold in restaurants that are reporting growth are Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand and Cabernet Sauvignon from France, while there’s also demand for varieties including Viognier and Montepulciano. Lower-priced wines, including entry-level Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay from Chile, as well as lower value Merlot from France and blends from Spain and South Africa have all lost volume and value share.
At premium restaurants in the UK, nine Old World countries account for 66% of both volume and value sales, the report finds, with seven countries from the New World providing the rest. This compares to gastro pubs who source 40% by volume and 37% by value from the New World. Liberty Wines suggests this might be because less hand-selling and explanation is need for these wines.
The report also highlighted the difficult climate for restaurants in the UK, with 2018 being marred by a series of high profile closures. According to statistics from UHY Hacker Young, the combined profits of the top 100 restaurant groups across the total on-trade were down 64% in 2018, with 35 of these businesses reporting a loss. With a special focus on London, the report states that food delivery services are becoming increasingly popular, up by 8% in the 2017/18 period in London compared to 4% across the UK, according to the ONS. This, it states, puts pressure on the on-trade, together with the revaluation of business rates which has seen reported rises of as much as 300% for some central London businesses, according to Colliers International.
Despite the challenging times, the premium share of the total UK on-trade still wine market increased, up from 10% by volume and 14% by value in 2017 to 11% and 15% respectively in 2018.
The on-trade report also included a breakdown of the different preferences according to sex and age. Liberty noted a third of women list Sauvignon Blanc in their top three wines and that they also said that they’re more likely to choose more expensive wines if different serving sizes are available. Meanwhile, men list wine critic scores and a frequently changing wine list as important when choosing more expensive wine (less important than more knowledgable staff) and 83% noted that they want good glassware.
The 18 to 44 age group are twice as likely to drink Prosecco more frequently than Champagne than those over 45, while only 21% rely on wine list tasting notes and recommendations to choose their wine. 49% of those under 45 drink weekly or more often in the premium on-trade, making them the most frequent visitors to such establishments, Liberty Wines notes.
Conversely, 17% of those aged 45 and over find wine confusing (compared to 50% in the younger age bracket), while only 9% look out for biodynamic or organic wine (compared to 41% in the lower age bracket.) 57% of those aged 45 and over believe staff knowledge is not good enough while one in four are looking to try something new or unfamiliar when dining out.
David Gleave MW, managing director of Liberty Wines, commented: “It is clear that consumers are still responding positively to help from informed staff, are looking for more, not less information on the wines and regions, and are actively seeking encouragement to try different wines. They are calling for good glassware and well-designed wine lists to help make their choices easier.
“These characteristics of the premium on-trade set this sector apart from the rest of the industry. They are relatively straightforward for on-trade operators to put into practice and, when combined with a good range of well-chosen wines, will lead to happier consumers who we believe will reward outlets that respond to their needs.”

#RawWineWeek, the annual celebration of low intervention and sustainable wines that promotes biodiversity, kicks off today, culminating in wine show Raw Wine London on Sunday.
The week-long celebration of organic, biodynamic and natural wines features an array of tutored tasting, glass offers, raw wine takeovers, winemaker dinners and talks, and runs from 6-13th March, with businesses taking part across London and Edinburgh.
Highlights include a pop-up of Austria’s two Michelin-starred Taubenkobel restaurant – dubbed one of the ‘coolest places to eat’ by Forbes – in Bermondsey’s Dynamic Vines Cellar, a vinyl Dj and Italian wine takeover at Enoteca Rabazzena, by four Italian wine producers, the Grape Escape, an evening with three natural winemakers hosted by the Riding Wine Company, and #RawWineWeek at Timberyard in the heart of Edinburgh’s Old Town.
The week culminates in Raw Wine London, which opens its doors on Sunday 10 march at The Store at 180 The Strand, for two days.
This year, over 160 producers from around the world will gather in London to showcase more than 800 top organic and biodynamic rose, red, white, orange and sparkling wines, some of which are not yet available in the UK.
As well as offering tastings, the show will feature curated talks on natural wines, including a talk and taste with The Drinks Business’s editor-in-chief, Patrick Schmitt MW on Understanding Bubbles, and an afternoon dedicated to US winemakers including Californian producers Hiyu Wine Farms.
The show’s line up includes Austrian producer Gut Oggau, Château Le Puy and Domaine Tawse, orange wine trailblazers Gravner and Radikon and Mount Etna wine producer Frank Cornelissen. The show’s tempting food offer is provided by Sager + Wilde (comprising a ‘fancy cheese on toast selection’), The Marksman (whose iconic Savoury British buns were described as “the best lunch to be eaten in Britain right now” by Jay Rayner), Walnut & Spice and Provisions.
The lively after-party will see The Laughing Heart take over Raw Wine, offering Cantonese food, a cellar poured by guest sommeliers and music from DJ Al Doyle, while London’s first natural wine bar, Terroirs, is also holding its own after party.
“By buying low-intervention, organic, biodynamic and natural wine, we’re helping to protect the planet and ourselves,” the organisers said.

The 2019 Climate Change Leadership conference began today (6 March) with the opening speakers tackling the immediate impact of climate change and how to face up to it.
Taking place in the northern Portuguese city of Porto, the opening two sessions included speakers from leading wine companies such as LVMH, Torres, Concha y Toro and Sogrape.
Across the two, hour-long, sessions, the message boiled down to reiterating the real challenges, disruption and threat radical climate change poses to global viticulture, with the choice being either a ‘living world’ or a ‘slime world’ where viticulture won’t matter anyway.
But there was also much positive talk on what can be done to fight it.
All six of the speakers shared insights into what their wineries were doing to be more efficient, greener and combat emissions.
They also outlined research and development efforts to help in this regard and the importance of the sharing and wider transmission of that knowledge to help others.
They stressed the need for the whole organisation, top to bottom, to believe in the way the winery and vineyard was being run.
Most of all, more implied than implicit, was the need for the big companies within the wine industry but also the industry as a whole to ‘be leaders’ and set an example in the fight against climate change.
Opening the conference, Adrian Bridge, CEO of the Fladgate Partnership, noted that “many companies were already doing much to tackle the problem” but also that he believed very strongly that, “the wine industry can take a leadership position,” in this fight.
Following him to the podium, Pau Roca, director general of the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV), echoed this sentiment.
‘The wine industry can’t save the world on it’s own,” he said, but continued, “it can be a doorway to change. We are small but we can be an example.”
In the first session, Miguel Torres of Familia Torres, Christina Mariani-May of Banfi and Margareth Henriquez of LVMH looked chiefly to how changes can be effected in the winery to fight emissions, while in session two, Kimberley Nicholas of the University of Lund, Antonio Graça of Sogrape and Gerard Casaubon of Concha y Toro looked at how vineyards can be adapted.
Many of the same themes came up at various points across the six presentations. The impact of climate change on vineyards, on grapes and therefore on wine and with it the threat to the very fabric of the industry itself was constantly reinforced.
But Graça stressed that it was important to be “resilient” and “face up to the challenges and disruption” being caused.
He and the others laid out a plethora of actions:

Changes to viticultural practices. Higher planting densities, training the vines to go high, returning to gobelet training (Torres even suggested “we may have to forget about mechanisation), avoid de-leafing, promote smaller canopies, zero herbicide use, natural fertilisers and so on.
Better clonal selection and use of native varieties: Torres has rediscovered some 50 pre-phylloxera grapes from Catalonia and 12 are being put back into production. Many ‘native’ varieties have properties such as high acidity and heat resistance that can make them extremely useful to winemakers in warming areas and help them in turn reduce their reliance on irrigation and so on. Meanwhile, Mariani-May pointed out how the clonal diversity of Sangiovese made it enormously adaptable to different sites and soils while Graça said that, “changing clones gives the potential to adapt to conditions without changing the variety”.
CO2 capture, water management and clean energy: From the use of photovoltaic panels to proper water management, biomass boilers, electric and hybrid tractors and company cars and so on, wineries can harness all manner of technology to make their businesses more self sufficient, efficient and keep emissions to a minimum if not nullify them almost entirely. Torres said that even if every winery were able to capture just 10% of their CO2 emissions it would make a significant difference.
Improvements to the supply chain: although there is much that wineries can control themselves more immediately, Torres pointed out that’s it not much good doing all the work if it is then offset negatively by an inefficient supply chain. He stressed the need for companies to do a complete audit that included the supply chain and challenge suppliers to do more to reduce emissions and provide sustainable packaging.
Conservation efforts: not everything has to be directed at viticulture. Both Concha y Toro and Torres are replanting thousands of hectares of native trees in southern Chile for example, Banfi has planted over 50 miles worth of cypress trees in Tuscany and only one third of its estate is planted with vines, with many ore hectares given over to olive groves and orchards too which all helps increase biodiversity. “It’s not just about protecting vines but the land,” said Mariani-May.

Movement to cooler areas is of course one option but Kimberley Nicholas was very forthright in her appraisal that this was not a sustainable strategy in the long-term.
“We need to figure out how to continue winemaking in places it’s already happening,” she said.
It was a point reinforced by Casaubon who said that, “climate change wants us to move south [in Chile] but we can’t move 25,000 tanks there.”
The only option, therefore, as Graça said, is to be resilient, invest in research where possible and then, as several of the others had said as well; share it.
As Mariani-May said: “If you don’t share it’s not going to help the whole movement.”
There’s no doubt that becoming carbon neutral and reorganising vineyards is expensive. Torres revealed that his company has invested over €15 million in R&D in this regard while Mariani-May also said how the whole effort was a “discipline, expensive and takes years. You have to work with a team that believes what you’re doing,” she added because, as Torres, said, doing all the work won’t necessarily help you sell more wine.
“No one is going to buy more jut because you’re mitigating climate change,” he said. Now, of course, many people do favour wines and other products made with the planet’s health in mind but his point was that a degree of selflessness beyond purely commercial goals was required for there to be truly beneficial results.
Above all, it was demonstrated how some of the bigger companies were taking the lead in creating more viable and sustainable viticulture.
Henriquez stressed how the entire move to sustainable practices needed to be, “a collective move, a culture of change”, and that had to come from the top.
Both she, Torres and Casaubon talked about how their respective companies try to work with their growers and entire supply chain to effect real change and become more sustainable – and importantly this has to cover both economically as well as environmentally.
Henriquez said it was vitally important now, “to be a good leader you have to have a social conscience.”
In conclusion, Torres said he hoped that, “one day you can drink a glass of wine and say you are helping CO2 reduction.”

Garima Arora, executive chef at one Michelin-starred Gaa in Bangkok, has won the title of Asia’s Best Female Chef 2019. Arora will be presented with her award at the ceremony for Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants on Tuesday 26th March 2019 in Macau.

William Drew, group editor of Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, said: “This award recognises female chefs whose passion, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit serve to inspire the next generation of cooks. Garima Arora has had a huge impact on the dining scene in Asia in a short period with her brilliant blend of Indian traditions and Thai ingredients.”
Arora worked briefly as a journalist before pursuing her interest in the culinary arts. After graduating from Le Cordon Bleu Paris in 2010, she worked at Noma in Copenhagen, learning alongside legendary chef René Redzepi. Recalling her two-year stint with world-renowned chef René Redzepi at Noma, she says the experience forever changed her approach to cooking.
“I learnt how to think about food more intelligently. I started looking at cooking more as a cerebral exercise, thinking about what you do, why you do it and understanding your place in a community,” she said.
Returning to Asia in 2016, Arora was appointed sous chef at Gaggan, the award-winning Bangkok restaurant that has held the number one position on the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list for four consecutive years. In April 2017, the chef opened Gaa, a three-storey restaurant located opposite Gaggan that celebrates a modern tasting menu using traditional Indian techniques. Showcasing her creativity and culinary inspirations, each dish is made from locally sourced ingredients and explores the connections between Thai and Indian food, from fruits and curries to sauces and spices.
The menu is a reflection of Arora’s cultural heritage as well as the community that surrounds her. Diners choose between a 10- or 14-course tasting menu, which changes quarterly to reflect seasonal specialties. In November 2018, Gaa earned its first Michelin star, making Arora the first Indian woman to win such an accolade.
Accepting the prestigious Best Female Chef title, Arora said: “This award is a validation of our team’s hard work and commitment to excellence. I am honoured that chefs and respected industry peers voting on this award recognise and appreciate our efforts.”
Frances Gaillard, international marketing director for the Stoli Group, added: “Garima has accomplished so much in such a short time – a true testament to her diligence and to her distinctive fusion of cuisines learned in some of the finest kitchens in Europe and Asia. We are pleased to be the latest to recognise this rising star in the gastronomy world.”

Carlsberg has acquired a minority stake in a Chinese craft brewer Jing-A, set up in 2012 with “a couple of 20-litre buckets, a handful of ingredients and a dream to brew the best possible beer in China”, say its founders.
Jing-A Brewery co-founders Alex Acker and Kris Li
Jing-A Brewery, founded by Alex Acker and Kris Li, is based in Beijing and is known for its use of Chinese ingredients such as red rice koji, ginger, and Sichuan peppercorn, and its interpretations of traditional beer styles such as IPA, witbier, and stout.
This week, the pair announced on their website that the brewery had received a minority investment from the Danish brewer Carlsberg “to fuel Jing-A’s next chapter”.
“With this new partnership, we continue to retain full control of Jing-A while receiving support where we most want it – state of the art brewing/lab facilities and a solid distribution network,” the statement read.
“We’ll be able to take the quality of our beers to the next level – including popular seasonal and small-batch beers from our brewpub – and make them more widely available to beer lovers in Beijing and throughout China.
“It will be the same people doing it, driven by the same passion and creativity – now with more support for quality, innovation, and distribution.”
The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it marks Carlsberg’s growing interest in the small but increasingly dynamic Chinese craft beer market.
China is already the world’s biggest beer market. According to Euromonitor International, the country drank 25 billion litres of beer in 2015, almost twice that of the US.
Other global brewers to have already made a play for the Chinese beer market include Dutch brewer Heineken, which in August 2018 acquired a 40% stake in China Resources Enterprise, the parent company of China’s largest brewer, for HK$24.4 billion (US$3.1 billion).
The agreement saw Heineken’s current operations in China combined with those of China Resources Beer with the latter gaining the licence for the Heineken brand in China.
Elsewhere, AB InBev opened mega brewery in China’s southern Fujian province capable of producing 160,000 cans an hour in 2017.

Taylor’s 1969 Tawny Port
Taylor’s has announced the release of the 1969 Single Harvest 50-year-old tawny Port, the latest in its range of limited-edition Ports. The 1969 is the sixth release so far in the Single Harvest series. The 1969 vintage had one of the highest winter rainfalls on record, followed by a hot July and August but the cool start to the summer meant harvesting did not start until early October.
Aged for 50 years in oak casks at Taylor’s lodge in Gaia, the wine is described as having a “deep mahogany” colour, “wild honey” and “cigar box aromas” on the nose, with “molasses, dried figs, sultanas and apricot confit” on the palate.

The owner of Total Wines, who was elected to Congress in last November’s mid-terms, has thrown his weight behind a US bill to more than double the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 – although a local newsite claims some of Total Wine employees are currently paid below the proposed new level.
David Trone (Photo: Total Wine & More)
The new Democratic Congressman, who founded Total Wines with his brother in 1985, said he would vote the pass the Raise the Wage Act, which he helped co-sponsor, that aims to raise the federal minimum wage from around $7.25 an hour to $15.
Posting an image on his Facebook page on Monday the Congressman and member of the Education and Labor Committee said there was “No place in America where a full-time worker [on] $7.25 an hour can afford the basic essentials”.
Trone added, “It’s time we stand up for the American worker and #FightforFifteen.”
He previously said it “made sense for business and was the right thing to do” and his website describes it as a “false choice” to choose between paying fair wages and remaining competitive.
“Paying our employees more is an investment in our people. And when you invest in people, you get great returns on that investment. It’s time that Congress took the same approach by investing in the American people.
“During his campaign, Trone was endorsed by the largest federal employee union, AFGE, as a lifelong supporter of workers. “He supports providing federal workers with the pay raises and benefits they deserve and opposes cutting funding for federal programs and services that all Americans rely on,” it said.
In a Facebook post last month, he said he “learned very early on that paying a fair wage is a win-win. It’s not just the right thing to do – it’s the key to success.”
“Higher wages lead to lower employee turnover and reduced recruiting and training costs. And at the end of the day, it leads to happier customers.”
However, according to Maryland news and politics site A Miner Detail, Total Wines’ current average salary currently falls slightly shy of the proposed new minimum wage, paying its employees around the $12 mark (a sum that was proposed as the federal minimum wage in 2015 that failed to make it into law) – although this is still well above the current national minimum.
The site quotes employment search engine Indeed.com listing the average retail sales associate at Total Wines as approximately $11.69 – although noting that the salary figures are approximate and based on third-party submissions.
The bill was introduced in January. As well as raising the minimum wage for the first time in ten years, the changes would sweep away a federal law that allows employers to pay workers who receive a tip, such as those working in the hospitality industry, less than this figure, or around $2.13 an hour.
Some US states have already adopted the higher figure, but if passed the bill would be applicable across all 50 states. However the issue has been divisive, with many Republicans arguing that the move would destroy small businesses. Previous attempts to raise the wage floor have failed, with some business groups lobbying aggressively against it. The last time changes were proposed calling for a $12 federal minimum wage in 2015, it was blocked.

The restaurateur behind London’s Pied à Terre, David Moore, has bought a London pub, The Deveraux off The Strand, with plans to turn it into a “proper pub” without “any pretence”.
Restaurateur David Moore
As first reported by Big Hospitality, Moore has teamed up with business partner and publican Tony Bennett for the project, having secured a 20-year lease on the former Greene King pub.  
The Grade II listed building dates back to 1676 as the Grecian Coffee House, and was remodelled as a pub in 1843.
The pub has been closed since 2017, with Moore and Bennett planning to revamp the 3,000 sq ft site, while retaining its historic features.
”I have always loved the idea of owning a traditional pub with a proper publican at the wheel”, said Moore. “Having been an iconic London pub since the 17th century, Tony and I feel obliged to honour the history and tradition of The Devereux.”
Moore opened the Michelin-starred Pied à Terre in Fitzrovia in 1991, and was also the founder of French restaurant L’Autre Pied in Marylebone, which closed in 2017.
An outspoken voice in London’s restaurant scene, last year, Moore accused the UK government of “sitting on its hands” while dozens of businesses collapsed or faced closure in the past year.

Oh, how stock markets love a rumour: a spate of speculation leads to share price oscillation and the chance to make a killing.

Just look at what happened to Diageo’s shares four years ago. A single, never confirmed, article in one Brazilian publication sent the shares jumping by almost 10% in a day.
The hope – and it was never more concrete than that – was that Jorge Paulo Lemann, Brazil’s richest man and head of AB InBev, and legendary US value investor Warren Buffett, were about to launch a break-up bid for the world’s biggest premium alcohol beverage group.
Lemann, so the article speculated, would fold Guinness into AB InBev while Buffett and his team would work their cost-cutting magic on the spirits portfolio.
It never happened, even if Lemann and Buffett had made initial calculations – which they almost certainly had. All groups periodically “run the numbers” on their rivals.
Diageo, under the then relatively new chief executive Ivan Menezes, had just put in place several strategies which have since paid off and its share price has added about 50%. So those investors who leapt on the rumour bandwagon and hung on have enjoyed the ride, especially as Diageo has since steadily increased its dividend and undertaken a hefty share buyback programme.
Is something similar about to happen at Pernod Ricard?
U.S. activist fund Elliott revealed in December it had spent around €930 million (£809 million) to build a stake of just over 2.5% in the world’s second-biggest spirits maker.
Elliott wants Pernod Ricard to raise profit margins to bring them more in line with larger rival Diageo’s and improve its corporate governance. The Ricard family hold about 14% of the shares but control 20% of the votes.
That has put chief executive Alexandre Ricard under some pressure because despite a raft of cost savings and a series of solid and improving results over the past couple of years, the French group gives the impression of having to run ever faster just to keep pace with Diageo.
One analyst, Berenberg, published calculations suggesting that Pernod Ricard could boost shareholder returns by 20% over time. This included selling off its wine division and further disposals of under-performing lines.
In February Ricard met the Elliott team and pledged to lift the French group’s margins and shareholder returns in a three-year strategic plan that Elliott described as a “first small step”.
Ricard also said was a “consolidator”, despite quietly disposing of his Argentine wines.
But the rumour machine was rumbling. Now that Pernod Ricard was in the spotlight, would LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury goods group, be about to lead a break-up bid. And might Diageo be an interested party?
In late January, Bernard Arnault, France’s richest man, said he did not want to destabilise Pernod Ricard and that he had nothing to do with Elliott buying a stake in the French spirits group. Diageo has never commented.
But despite the denials, the speculation will not go away and Pernod Ricard’s shares sit at a record high.
True that has much to do with its continuing performance, Ricard’s confidence in increasing his guidance on this year’s results and the appearance of Elliott on the shareholders’ register.
Even so, still some believe Arnault might be lurking. LVMH encompasses the Moet champagne empire, Hennessy cognac and Glenmorange scotch whisky among other luxury drinks. In fashion, luggage and hotels it espouses the very highest of luxury. Would many of Pernod Ricard’s brands complement that image?
The Glenlivet and Chivas Regal scotches would be a reasonable fit, but what about Absolut vodka, the Irish whiskies and pastis? Fine brands but not as aspirational as M. Arnault. Jacob’s Creek and Campo Viejo hardly sit well with Cheval Blanc and d’Yquem.
Many of the Pernod Ricard brands that might come under the hammer, according to the break-up theorists, are unlikely to interest Diageo.
It has exited wines and around the world competition authorities would raise their eyebrows about more of the scotch industry falling into is lap. In Smirnoff it has the best selling vodka so Absolut (and its problems) are of little interest. However, despite setting up its own Irish whiskey production, the Jameson range would be an obvious attraction.
In addition, a deal with Diageo, the optimists speculate, would allow LVMH to take back the 34% Diageo owns of Moet Hennessy. But there is no commercial reason why Menezes would want to sell his stake in the champagnes and cognacs. They pay a good dividend (so he is already earning a good return on the capital invested) and he will never be able to buy a stake in either sector with sufficient volume to give him global reach – unless Arnault would be willing to sell Moet and Hennessy to him!
According to Berenberg, LVMH’s drinks arm has an operating margin of 31.7% while Pernod Ricard’s is about 26%. That’s the room for improvement that Elliott has identified. But Arnault had his image tarnished a few years back when he waged a public battle for Hermes and he is unlikely to wish to descend from his pedestal when luxury assets such as Chanel and Patek Philippe might be charmed into his luxury group.
And beneath the surface lurks the French government. Pernod Ricard is a constituent of the elite CAC30, the index of the biggest companies quoted on the Paris stock market. Would the Elysee demur quietly as a flagship company disappeared?
So those buying into Pernod Ricard shares should be prepared to rely on pressure from Elliott and his own ambition to one day eclipse Diageo to see Alexandre Ricard produce results similar to those enjoyed by Diageo in the wake of a single speculative comment four years ago.

Two members of the UK drinks trade were honoured last night for their “outstanding contribution to Spanish wine” at an annual dinner for the Gran Orden de Caballeros del Vino.

Pierre Mansour, of The Wine Society, and Paul Shinnie, of Alliance Wine, have been named the newest Caballeros, after they were formally invested into the Order by His Excellency D. Carlos Bastarreche, the ambassador of Spain, and Sra. Dña. María Peña Mateos, chief executive officer of ICEX, at a dinner held at The Dorchester on 5 March.
Established in 1984, the Gran Orden recognises those who have “acted over and above the call of duty” and made an outstanding contribution to the promotion of Spanish wines, be that in the bodega, the restaurant, through sales or the written word.
Mansour has worked in the wine industry for his entire career, in management and buying positions, and is currently head of buying at The Wine Society. He has direct responsibility for sourcing The Society’s Spanish range, sales of which have increased significantly since he has been buying this region.
Over the course of his 40-year career in the wine industry, Paul Shinnie has worked in both retail and as an importer, running his own specialist importer of Spanish wines, Vinites UK (which went on to be called From Rhone to Rioja).
In 2015 Paul sold his business to Alliance Wine and joined them as buyer for Spain, where he remains. In his own words this was a decision that “has allowed him to continue his commitment to Spanish growers and realise for them more than he could on his own”.
With the two new recruits, the Gran Orden comprises 66 members from both Spain and the UK.

The US’ largest drinks distributor, Southern Glazer’s, has launched a new wine division for its Canadian subsidiary business in a bid to grow its wine distribution across Canada.
The new wine division of Southern Glazer’s Wine & Spirits of Canada comprises a dedicated sales team targeting both the on-trade and off-trade in Canada, the company said.
Doug Wieland, Southern Glazer’s executive vice president and general manager of Canada said there was an “enormous opportunity” to grow the wine business on the back of its “extensive” Canadian customer base.
“Wine is an important part of our overall growth strategy in the market and we’ll continue to leverage our strength in this segment and make investments that bring even more focused attention to wine in Canada,” he said.
Scott Oppenheimer, president of control states and Canada said it was just one of several new initiatives to drive growth and long-term profitability in Canada.
The company operates in 44 states in the US, as well as Canada and the Caribbean, employing around 20,000 people, it said.
Last year the Canadian branch of the distributor created an off-shoot of its business dedicated to cannabis products ahead of the country legalising the drug for recreational use.

Almost a year on from being “hours away from collapse” after the fall of former owner and UK wholesaler Conviviality, managing director of Matthew Clark, David Philips, and director of wine buying, Simon Jerrome, reveal the changes the company has made to turn its fortunes around.
David Philips and Simon Jerrome.
Speaking to the drinks business at the first of Matthew Clark’s Uncovered events in London yesterday, Philips and Jerrome revealed how the company had worked to get things back on track following the collapse of its former owner, Conviviality, in April last year. 
In April, Matthew Clark, along with Bibendum and subsidiary businesses Catalyst, Peppermint, Elastic and Walker & Wodehouse were purchased by the C&C group, the owner of brands including Magners and Bulmers cider.
In May, the C&C Group announced that it would would be repaying the debts racked up by Conviviality and had agreed a repayment schedule with both HMRC and three banks which lent money to former UK drinks wholesaler, with the money owed totalling c. £138 million.
Since then Matthew Clark has done some restructuring of the business, but has largely remained quiet as it re-grouped following the acquisition. It is now changing changing tack, unveiling a re-vamped event series called Uncovered.
Uncovered, which returns this year after a hiatus in 2018, will also see portfolio tastings scheduled in Edinburgh, Manchester and Bristol. Asked why it was returning this year, Philips said: “It’s important for us to make a statement to the trade and to especially promote one of the key themes of the event, that of ‘discovery’.
“Investing in our customers is vital and we’re expecting upwards of 5,000 visitors to our Uncovered tastings, making this the biggest event series in the country.”
Commenting on the progress made since April 2018, Philips said that the company had been quietly working to get back on track as well as safeguard the business for the future.
“The business was hours away from collapse in April, but since then we’re spent a lot of time, energy and effort getting it back on track,” he said.
“It took us five months to get our wine stocks back to normal levels. We also paid off all debts owed, both to our customers and also the crown – this was particularly important for us going forward.
“Our biggest focus has been on the service we provide to our customers. Last year we concentrated on getting our operations in order so that we could support our customers through their busiest trading period. This we did and over Christmas we recorded the highest service levels we’ve had in two years.
“Our job now is to get people out from behind their TVs, watching Netflix and eating Deliveroo meals into the on-trade. To do that, we must provide choice and an experience.”
Delivery and IT
One of the areas in which the company is investing is their logistics and delivery services. Philips recalled how under Conviviality, the business had become more centralised, a measure Matthew Clark has now reversed.
The business now has five separate business units covering different regions in Britain with dedicated sales, marketing and operations teams. Now boasting 11 depots across Britain, meaning it “can provide localised delivery across the country,” Philips added that the company had opened a new 65,000 sqft depot in Southampton just last week
“We’re doing these regional events for a reason,” he continued. “We supply over 17,000 outlets, so for us, it’s about spreading our message and taking our story on the road.
“We want consistency across all our uncovered events with the theme of discovery, or indeed re-discovery for many. We’ve got 7,500 product lines, over 120 sales people and have 200 vehicles on the road everyday.
“We’re a national distributor and we’re really proud of that. But we’re also a regional business with goods delivered by people that have a real local knowledge of the area.”
Asked whether they were trying to emulate the Amazon model, Philips added: “It’s more of a defence against Amazon, if we’re honest. We can offer next-day delivery, but are don’t have the technology and scope that Amazon does. That said, part of our efforts now is to put our head above the water and keep an eye on progress in the same-day delivery service sector.
While the company has committed funds to developing its IT software and digital platforms, Philips stresses that “you can’t have a one size fits all approach.”
“Last week we had our first million pound day on our platforms, but it’s about having a blend of physical and digital and leaving our customers to choose how they want to conduct their business.”
In particular, Matthew Clark has invested in making its platforms easy to use from mobile devices, while still retaining a large telesales and customer service team for those who prefer to speak to someone over the phone.
“While we’re living in a world where people do their shopping on their phones, on the other hand, we’ve got customers that want to fax things into us,” said Philips.
“In Bristol, we’ve got a 120-strong telesales team, plus a 30-strong customer services steam. There’s still plenty of people that prefer talking over the phone.”
Brexit
Along with drinks companies including Pernod Ricard, Diageo, The Wine Society, Majestic Wines, Ellis Wines and MMD, Matthew Clark has confirmed that it is stockpiling ahead of the 29 March.
Philips told db how the company has committed to a multi-million investment in wine which will see it double its wine stocks held in the UK ahead of 29 March. Matthew Clark will be holding the stock in its bonded warehouse in Bristol before it is then transported around the country.
“Like many others, we’ve gone down the stockpiling route in order to protect supply to our customers for as long as we can do. Our beer and spirits partners are also doing likewise,” Philips said.
Trends and targets
Speaking about the trends in the industry, one element that Matthew Clark is particularly focusing on is the domestic wine, beer and spirits industry. Asked whether this was in response to the pressures of Brexit, Philips said that he believes it’s “wider” than that, and reflects a trend that has been gathering pace for many years.
“This is something the food industry has been doing for years,” he said. “We were discussing this earlier and came to the conclusion that the drinks industry is about 10 years behind the food sector in this field.”
As part of its efforts to “future-proof” the business, Matthew Clark is actively identifying and responding to trends, for example veganism and the rise of low- and no-alcohol products.
Commenting on the process, Jerrome said: “We’re really just responding to what our customers are telling us. 70% of the wines we carry – that’s 800 wines – are vegan-friendly. We’ve got producers coming to us and talking about exploring new options, experimenting with p-proteins for example. I really believe that it’s possible for our wines to be 100% vegan friendly in a few years. We’re adapting to what the consumer needs and we feed this back to our producers. 
“The key is providing choice and quality at all price levels. It’s no good just saying ‘here’s our no- and low- range’ and that’s it. We’ve got to have the best out there. If you’ve tasted the ranges at some supermarkets, there’s a real difference between the offerings.”
Asked about changes made to the portfolio following Matthew Clark’s acquisition by the C&C group, Jerrome said the focus had been on consolidation.
“We’ve re-looked at and re-tasted everything,” he said. “We’ve brought in new products, for example this is the first event where we’ve had wine in cans.
“Then we’ve got Hardys who have now developed an alcohol-free Chardonnay. The alcohol-free market is developing and there’s been a lot of improvement in production techniques and how you actually remove the alcohol.
“People like Torres are doing it really well, but many of the options in the supermarkets are very sweet. It’s about making sure you get it right and for me it should be no different to a normal glass of wine. This isn’t necessarily something everyone is going to drink, but we need alcohol-free drinks to become part of a range offered by an outlet.”
Jerrome also noted a change in the price that people are prepared to spend on wine in the on-trade.
“10 years ago if you mentioned selling a glass of wine for £9 people would think you’re joking, now they’re prepared to spend that,” he said. “In the venues where you’ve got the trained staff who can explain the different options to guests, people are more prepared to try different things. For us it’s often when people trust the house wine that they’re more willing to try another recommendation.”

Specialist wine retailer Majestic has seen a 49% surge in sales at its two stores in Calais in February, its “biggest ever month” outside of the Christmas period, as managing director Joshua Lincoln hails a “new generation of cruiser millennials.”
Majestic Wine has reported a rise in trips across the Channel ahead of the Brexit deadline of 29 March. Its two stores in the French port town of Calais have seen a 49% rise in sales last month, while pre-orders are up 78% for March.
According to a statement put out by the company, Majestic pays for the cost of a Channel crossing if customers pre-order wine worth over £250.
While exchange rates are not as favourable as they were in heydays of the booze cruise in the late 1990s, Majestic still estimates that customers save an average of £3 a bottle. It cited Codorníu’s Brut non-vintage Cava as an example, which retails for £9.99 in the UK but for £3.29 in Calais.
Commenting on the findings, Joshua Lincoln, managing director at Majestic Wine said: “This is a new generation of cruiser millennials. “It’s couples getting ready for their summer weddings now. It’s day trippers from the Scottish Highlands taking on a mammoth trek.
“It’s not necessarily people buying as much as they can, as cheaply as they can. Pre-orders are up 78% and the order value is up too –  these are wine lovers spending the same as they would in the UK, and getting considerably better bottles for it. And they’re doing it now.”
Fellow business Calais Wine Superstore is also experiencing record sales, up 51% since January with pre-orders for March up by 100%.
Speaking to the Guardian, Marco Attard, co-owner of the business, said the store had served two and a half times as many shoppers last week as the same period last year. It also sold the same volume of wine last Saturday than it sold in the whole week last year.
“Since March it has gone ballistic,” Attard said. “It’s all about Brexit. People don’t want to miss out. I’ve been in this business since 1993 and I have never seen anything like this.”
Majestic previously told the drinks business that it was stockpiling around £5 – £8m worth of alcohol in the run up to Brexit, with group chief financial officer James Crawford stating that the company was “in a position to be agile to whatever the market throws at us.”
Last month temporary insurance provider tempcover.com created a digital calculator to calculate how much money Brexit stockpilers could save on wine and beer by driving to France.

A replacement for Goudet, who is managing director of JAB Holdings, will be announced at the next shareholder meeting on 24 April, it has been announced.
The chairman confirmed he would step down to devote more time to his “growing responsibilities as managing partner and CEO of JAB”.
JAB, which owns Krispy Kreme and Pret a Manger, acquired coffee and soft drinks maker Keurig Dr Pepper in 2018, a move than sources close to the matter claim raised concerns with AB InBev’s board members that its interests are wedded closely to theirs, reports the Financial Times.
“We are extremely grateful for Mr. Goudet’s many contributions and commitment to our company over the eight years as member of the board and four years as chairperson,” AB InBev said in an emailed statement.
“The board’s succession plan has been developed since last year and we have been working with Mr. Goudet on a smooth transition.”
An increasing number of breweries are investing in alternative products such as soft drinks and non-alcoholic beer, to capitalise on the global decline in alcohol consumption and slowdown in mass-produced lager sales. AB InBev itself acquired US-based craft spirits company Cutwater Spirits in February.
In the US, Heineken-owned brewery Lagunitas has developed a non-alcoholic, IPA ‘inspired’ water, following the launch of a similar product by Japanese drinks giant Suntory in May 2018.

As part of a new series where top winemakers reveal their favourite dining spots in London, Pierre Emmanuel Taittinger praises Adam Handling’s lobster mac ‘n’ cheese and explains why he’s rather partial to a pint of beer.
1. What is your favourite restaurant in London?
I adore the Frog by Adam Handling in Covent Garden. We launched our new vintage of Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs 2007 there last summer. The food was stunning, such a talented young chef. His famous lobster mac ‘n’ cheese was sublime with our new vintage.
2. Where / what is your favourite wine offering in London and what would be your go-to first glass of wine when you get there?
Actually am I allowed to have a pint of beer, for me that is always a treat when I come to the UK!
3. How does London compare to other big global cities in terms of the wine lists you find there? 
London has the most amazing choice of wine – in France our lists tend to be very regional and this is the same in Italy and Spain. We do not get the diversity you have in London. I love the variety you have and if I want to try something from Slovakia, Uruguay or even China, I can find it in London.
Last year, Frog by Adam Handling was placed 50th in Wine List Confidential’s top 100 restaurants for wine.

At Emily Roux and Diego Ferrari’s debut venture in Notting Hill, sommelier Romeo Bisacchi sums up the wine list: “We’ve got no Pétrus or Romanée-Conti, but we do have stuff you couldn’t find elsewhere”.
Previously Bumpkin, the romantico Caractère with brick walls and maps including Paris with the Seine picked in gold, is a petite amble down a mews from The Ledbury. It was opened by partners in life and business, Emily Roux, daughter of Michel Roux Jr. of Le Gavroche, and Diego Ferrari, who was Head Chef there for three years. As with dishes, the clean list by Romeo Bisacchi, who was born in Monaco and raised in Genoa, equitably honours the French and Italian heritages of Roux and Ferrari.
Before moving to London, Bisacchi worked at Florence’s grand dame, Enoteca Pinchiorri. He recalls owner, Giorgio Pinchiorri opening titan wines over staff dinners, “narrating, grandad-like, how he discovered Masetto, buying the first vintages…”
Rather than Prosecco, Bisacchi is proud to be London’s only restaurant pouring traditional method Trento, Ferrari Perlé Bianco Riserva by-the-glass (in John Jenkins glassware).
“I’m starting to understand what guests like and just added 40 labels,” says Bisacchi, whose restrained cellar, racked left to right “because that’s how you read,” is evenly priced, including a dainty Bourgogne Blanc from reputable Etienne Sauzet, “made with younger vines”, a reasonable maturing Cantemerle and winsomely meek Dolcettos and Barberas, plus starry Barolos and a Bordeaux impersonating Tuscan Cabernet Franc (Duemani). When explaining his list, Bisacchi mentioned he always suggests floral Arneis over arguably anodyne Gavi di Gavi.
“Ingredients move the balance,” says Bisacchi of wine matching with the unusually categorised menu where “Subtle” headlines vegetable-focused small plates, “Delicate” refers to fish mains, and “Greedy” leads on to puddings. Dishes may include scallop with hazelnut, and bringing bitterness, radicchio tardivo matched with Greco di Tufo “for freshness and minerality”. Indeed, Bisacchi’s favourite region is Campania, home to “perfect Greco di Tufo, Fiano di Avelino and Falanghina by Quintodecimo whose maker, Luigi Moi, worked in Burgundy for 25 years.” Herdwick rack of lamb with rainbow chard and Ratte potatoes, “produced by the sea hence salinity”, is finished with lamb jus. On that note, “jus” is a Gallic aspect enriching dishes, “giving an explosion of flavour,” says Bisacchi, who prescribes the lamb structure and spicy red fruit via Côtes du Rhône (Moncoeur, Jean-Louis Chave). With sweet Gorgonzola, Bisacchi introduces tea coloured Curatolo Arini Marsala (Pellegrino). Be sure to leave room for digestif, Bloomsbury Pastis magnifying star anise, cucumber and Sussex hops.
“You live it seven days a week,” says Bisacchi of his vocation. When not in Notting Hill, you may see him admiring stock at Hedonism before checking prices online – “the internet is moving wine prices,” he says.
Incidentally, with jollity, Caractère’s entirely Italian front-of-house, including Maître d, Eugenio Simonelli from Fiuggi, a town near Rome famed for its “miraculous” waters, lay trattoria-esque red checkered tablecloths for their own meals…

An event at ProWein on Sunday 17 March will see the world’s biggest wine brands take part in a tasting that will be conducted ‘blind’.
Comprising the biggest names in the wine business from a range of countries, including China, the event plans to assess the quality and style of the world’s best-selling brands by showing them without giving the tasters any information on the producer behind the blends.
Because the tasting is blind, obviously we can’t reveal here the names of the brands that will feature, but panellists can expect to sample famous wines from France, Italy, the US, Australia, South Africa, Chile and China.
The event will be moderated by Patrick Schmitt MW, and plans to yield some interesting results, and hopefully change preconceptions among the trade about style, scale, source and quality in the wine business.
The event will take place from 3-4pm on Sunday at the fair. It is open to wine professionals only, and for more information, or to attend the blind tasting, please email Sophie Allan at sophie.allan@unionpress.co.uk

Sarah Jessica Parker x Invivo
American actress Sarah Jessica Parker, famous for playing Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City, has announced that she is launching a wine range in collaboration with New Zealand winery Invivo.
Due to launch this summer, SJP worked alongside Invivo’s founders, Tim Lightbourne and Rob Cameron, to develop the range, which includes a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and a rosé.
“I’m a true wine lover and love including wine in family dinners and occasions with friends, so this is a very exciting and fun project for me. I’m looking forward to every stage of the creation process,” Parker said. “I intend to be very hands-on throughout, as I am with all my endeavours, and could not be partnering with a better brand than Invivo.
“I’m looking forward to traveling to New Zealand to see where the grapes grow and the wine is made. The boys even brought me a pair of gumboots, which, they assure me, are the height of Kiwi vineyard fashion,” she added.

There has been much comment in recent days about the 2009 vintage which, would you know it, has reached its 10th anniversary. 

Most observations are a reminder of how fabulous the vintage is and how euphoric most critics were when it went into barrel, and how prices have fared in the intervening period. Interesting a rehash of events as this might be, it is hardly news, and seems to us to miss the point.
There is a great line from medieval sleuth Cadfael played by the incomparable Derek Jacobi as he tries to pacify a family whose recent fortunes have taken a turn for the worse: “you move ahead from where you stand”. Recent events need not fore-ordain what happens next. Many coherent stock market commentators argue that past price movements have no predictive value.
At Amphora we strongly suggest that fine wine investors don’t get too hung up on their entry price. It is always a mistake to hold on to a wine, or a stock for that matter, because you bought it at a higher price, and the reason for that is that market conditions change. A set of circumstances which suggested that such and such a wine might be good value at point A might change to the degree that it is no longer good value at point B. That is what happens in a varied market place of prices with dynamic movement.
In consequence you have to look at the 2009s in accordance with their relative value right now, irrespective of the price at which they came to market. It is true that a poor “listing price” can take some time to unwind, but we are well past that point by now. The only true measures of whether or not you buy, sell or hold a 2009 are as to how they stack up against other vintages from the same producer, or the same vintage from a producer of equivalent status.
So, as they are in the news right now we have run our algorithmic slide-rule over a bunch of 2009s to see where exactly the bargains lie, and if you go alphabetically you don’t have to wait long before you find something winking at you.
 Alongside the 2010, Angelus 2009 is the best relative value vintage from that producer at these levels. Both are 99+ scorers so only exceeded by the 2005 which was upgraded from 98 points in 2015 at the 10 year retrospective. In price terms they also lag the Millennium vintage, and the 2012 which has a commemorative bottle.
Customarily amongst the Grands Cru Classe A and the First Growths the on-vintages will trade at premiums over off-vintages at anywhere from 40% up to 100%, and this differential is far lower with Angelus, and with Pavie for that matter. 
This pair was elevated to Classe A only in 2012 so it may be that the market is taking a while to fully adjust, and if so Angelus 2009 would be a good selection as part of Right Bank exposure in a diversified portfolio, outperforming over time as the adjustment comes through.
Moving to the First Growth sector Lafite sticks out like a sore thumb. Here is the chart representation for the Lafite Rothschilds’ relative value:

As mentioned above there is usually a healthy on-vintage premium at this end of the market, but not for Lafite. Despite its reputation and standing it has only one 100 pointer over the last 50 years, in 2003, so at 99+ the 2009 is better than all the rest, as Tina Turner might say. Considerably better than the 94 point 2007 which trades at a discount of a mere 12%. Remember that Robert Parker scored the 1996 vintage 100 but Neal Martin downgraded to 98 in October 2016. 
Now it is possible that Lafite’s reputation is damaged beyond repair, ironically, by its earlier popularity, or by its ill-starred en primeur release price, but we think this highly unlikely. We believe, rather, that consumers will look back from some future date and reflect sadly that they had so long an opportunity to buy it at around the £7,500 mark, and recommend that current investors do not make that mistake.
If Lafite 2009 is too cheap the 2010 is not far behind, and we can see a similar effect in the Super Seconds with both Beychevelle and Duhart Milon. What is really interesting here is that these were also darlings of the pre 2011 Asia-inspired rally, Duhart ostensibly because of its Rothschild link and Beychevelle because its label resembles a Dragon boat.
Plausible as that explanation may be, it doesn’t square with the evidence:

It is quite possible that Duhart Milon 2009 doubled initially because in absolute price terms it was so inexpensive and you could argue cause and effect for its underperformance since then, but whilst it has certainly underperformed Beychevelle which experienced no significant hangover from the correction, it has actually outperformed both the Liv-ex 100 and Lafite 2009.
The point we would make is that the relative cheapness of both Beychevelle and Duhart Milon in the 2009 and 2010 vintages should be taken at face value. Do not avoid them because of any imaginary concerns, seductive or otherwise.
Elsewhere in the Super Second sector you can see large disparities between the 2009s and 2010s of both Ducru Beaucaillou and Leoville Poyferre, but the former vintages in both cases enjoy 100 point scores. A perfect score matters. So does the vintage quality. If you find cases where one or two of the cardinal price determinants is being ignored you are often on to something:
Buy the 2009 vintages of Lafite, Beychevelle, and Duhart Milon, not forgetting Angelus.

Wineries in Great Britain enjoyed a boom in both domestic and overseas sales last year, but a new report suggests that exports will play a crucial role in the fledgling industry’s future.

Producers from England and Wales sold an estimated 2.6 million bottles of wine throughout 2018, according to the survey, a rise of 186% since 2017. Around 8% of these were overseas exports.
This is a 3% boost on 2017. In fact, the proportion of wine sold within the UK has actually fallen compared to the previous period. Around 53% of bottles were sold through UK trade, down from 55% in 2017, while cellar door sales accounted for just under a third (32%), compared to 36% the previous year.
Acreage, too has risen since 2017 at a rate of 13%. Some 1.6 million vines were planted in 2018, with a further 2 million expected this year, it said. The majority of this is planted with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Bacchus, which between them account for 76% of all plantings.
The biggest export markets being USA and Scandinavia, which together receive 65% of total overseas sales, according to WineGB.
The industry body expects that exports may account for 30-40% of the total wine produced in Great Britain by 2040, yielding a potential value of some £350 million per year.
By 2040, Wines of Great Britain also expect wine tourism in the UK to generate an additional revenue of £658m per annum.
“Our figures detail the considerable pace of growth taking place here in the UK and what exciting predictions and opportunities lie in the future,” Simon Robinson, chairman of WineGB, said.
“As a sector we are bringing many developments in agriculture, tourism, education, investment and employment. This is now a thriving and confident British industry in which we can be justifiably proud. Watch this space!”
We’ve listed the biggest export markets for wineries in Great Britain, according to WineGB’s 2019 report.

Aldi has launched an English still wine into its aisles for the first time, as the trend for crisp, crunchy, acidic wines gathers momentum, fuelled by last year’s long hot summer.
Aldi’s Exquisite Collection Lyme Block English wine 2018
The discounter has added an exclusive signature white Bacchus-Pinot Blanc blend from Lyme Bay Winery into its Exquisite Collection, which will be available  in store and online from 18 March. The 48% Bacchus, 26% Pinot Blanc, 9% Solaris and 17% other varietal blend comes of the back of a new partnership with the innovative Axminster–based winery, and made in collaboration with Lyme Bay’s head winemaker Liam Idzikowski.
Speaking to the drinks business at yesterday’s Spring tasting, Aldi buyer Mike James said that last summer’s scorching summer made it the year “to make a go of it” with English still wine, adding that it tapped into the growing demand for crisp, crunchy white wines and rosés, which had gained momentum over the summer.
“It was almost a manifestation that the trend was there already, customers were already moving onto that style of wine, so the great summer was all about that impetus. To crack on with that, we’ve thrown caution to the wind but even if it’s a grey day (like today) for the rest of the summer, customer’s palate are now tuned that style of wine,” he said.
“Customers are having fewer preconceptions and less barriers to purchase, and thinking ‘I’ll give this a go, and if I like it, I’ll buy it again’,”
“Those seafood wines are really what people are after, so there are a lot on those types of styles.”
James said the team had therefore “bigged up” the range with that style, adding a number of Galician whites including an Albanta Albariño 2018 (rrp: £7.99) and some “exciting” whites from Portugal, including Animus Vinho Verge 2018 (rrp: £4.79) and a single variety Avesso from producer The Wine Foundry (rrp: £6.49) Picpoul de Pinet and Exquisite Collection Muscadet (rrp: £5.69)
“Hopefully what Aldi does well is bring the right wines to markets but not necessarily your go-to Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay, something a bit different,” James explained.
“What’s nice is that, like the Avesso and the English Bacchus blend, we’ve not just beating the Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc. Yes of course they are hugely important wines for all of us, but we like to think we’re a bit quirky and able to push new and innovative styles and varieties out to people.”

“We’ve got the loyalty from our customers so that when it goes on sale, they trust it’s going to be a good wine for the price.”
A good example of this trend was the Clare Valley Riesling, he said, which had been in the range for a number of years but became a “star performer” over the summer, and has continued to see strong sales well into January and February. James said this was indicative that the trend for these styles had gathered momentum and was here to stay.
“Customers are buying into it and maybe that’s because they were pushed towards it over the summer, but then realised that the style was appealing to them and they’re continuing to buy it now.”
It has also extended its range of rose – which James said was “massive last year”, particularly those in the popular Cote de Provence style, and a number of Portuguese reds.
“We’ve had massive success with Portuguese reds such as the Duoro, so now we’re expanding into Dão,” he explained. “We’re very much banging the Portuguese drum, it’s a great place to get great quality, good value wines in a style the customers love.
“It has been an exciting place for us, and continues to be – a recent article in the drinks business talked about the growth of Portuguese’s wine in the UK and we’re largely responsible for that, so it has been great to be there early on.”
Seeing that “huge, double-digit growth” in Portuguese wine pointed out an important lesson on getting the style right, he said.
“We got the style right into what was essentially a very small part of the market and people loved it, and it grew and grew and grew. It’s then just about understanding what people liked about it – easy-drinking well-made wines, that’s what you’ll get with Dão.”
“That’s an important lesson for wine buyers on what to sell.”
The retailer is also set to expand its selection of Eastern European wines in the near future.

Following the success of Catalan restaurant Rambla, chef Victor Garvey will open Barullo in the City of London, serving food from across Spain.
Garvey opened Rambla on Soho’s Dean Street, following restaurants Encant and Sibarita, both of which are now closed. Barullo will open in Aldgate, on the site formerly occupied by James Cochran EC3, with plans for a further Soho restaurant, Bar Jaleo, later this year.
Translating from Spanish as hubbub, Garvey intends the 64-cover restaurant to be a brightly coloured and bustling space.
He said: “I want a visit to Barullo, however long or short, to feel like taking a trip to Spain; an escape from the daily grind whether that means a leisurely dinner or grabbing some really great lunch to take back to the office.”
The menu will feature a KFC ‘Kiko Fried Chicken’ consisting of Sherry lees-brined chicken dusted in roasted corn nuts fried with Algeria pepper chutney, and a paella ‘La Masia’ of saffron Calasparra rice, giant prawns and confit pork belly, fire-roasted with piquillo peppers. Desserts on offer will include toasted coconut ice-cream with sour cherry marmalade and Pedro Ximenez reduction.
The dishes, wine and beer will also be available to take away, with the restaurant holding a license to retail alcohol.
Barullo will be open Monday to Saturday, serving lunch and dinner. The restaurant opens in March.

With two successful years now on the books, the organisers of Vinexpo New York say the event is well on its way to becoming a permanent fixture in the growing catalogue of wine fairs now spanning the globe.

“It’s the one place where producers from around the world can interact with the U.S. market in the U.S.,” says Mary Larkin, executive vice president of U.S. operations for Diversified Communications, which helped organise the two-day event which ended Tuesday evening at the Jacob Javits Center. Dates for the third annual conference are March 2-3, 2020.
Altogether, there were about 3,000 wine and spirits professional from more than 40 U.S. states and seven Canadian provinces attending the affair, with more than 400 exhibitors from 26 countries.  About 800 one-on-one meetings between mostly sellers and potential buyers were arranged by the organisers. This year, the booths were all located in one hall, and traffic in the aisles both days was brisk.
Vinexpo New York organisers also presented a stronger slate of informational and educational events to attract people in the American trade, and it appears this approach will be a strong drawing card in the future for American attendees.  Among the sessions were:

A talk by Dr. John P. Holdren of Harvard University addressing the current scientific understanding of global climate change and its impacts around the world for wine production. Dr. Holdren used a hockey analogy to illustrate that dealing with climate change for wine producers is a moving target, saying, “You have to skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it is.”
Heavy hitters came out for the panel presentation on trends in the U.S. wine market, including Chris Adams, CEO, Sherry-Lehmann Wine and Spirits; Steve Slater, EVP and general manager of the wine division for Southern Glazer’s Wine & Spirits;  Bill Terlato, CEO, Terlato Wine Group, and Rick Tigner, CEO, Jackson Family Wines. All concluding that the channels for wine sales and distribution are rapidly changing and not in favor of the traditional corner wine shop.
Another panel on emerging technologies featured presentations by newer, smaller companies emphasising digital marketing platforms and specialised apps.

Larkin would not say whether Vinexpo might be planning on expanding the event to other American cities, such as possibly one on the West Coast, but she did reiterate that Vinexpo New York will remain an annual event and would not revert to being held every other year.

Aldi has appointed two new wine buyers to its award-winning team.
Josh Heley, Aldi wine buyer
The discounter has appointed Andrew Clarke, who joins the team from Greene King, where he was purchasing manger. Clarke previously spend two years as wine buying manager at the Spirit Pub Company, before it was acquired by the pub giant, and prior to that he worked as a wine writer after starting his wine career at Majestic.
Josh Heley (left) has also joined the team, replacing David Elliot who has moved to another part of the business. Heley has been at Aldi for six years, including three as a buyer, latterly in pet food, completing his WSET qualifications in his spare time.
Heley said one of the biggest challenges of the year would be to further elevate the retailers sparkling wine offer after last year’s success.
“In December we sold over 17 million bottles of Champagne and Prosecco, which equates to an incredible 3.2 million glasses of fizz per day, so it will be a tough act to follow!” he said.
He said he would also be expanding the range of Eastern European wines.

Rioja producer Ramón Bilbao is tapping into the growing trend for ‘less-is-more’ mid-week drinking by rolling out a new Rioja Reserva in a 50cl bottle.
The new three-quarter size bottle, which is available at The Co-op (RRP: £7.00) is part of the producer’s ‘El Viaje de Ramón’ range that was launched for the off-trade last year to take consumers through the “progressive, innovative side of Rioja”, it said.
The range comprises the new Rioja reserve and a 75cl ‘clarete’ pale pink Rosado (RRP £8.99).
UK Manager Kirsty Loftus said Reserva was an important category for Rioja, accounting for 22.4% of all Rioja imports to the UK, almost double that of Crianza (according to stats from DOCa Rioja, November 2018). The brand is one of the fastest-growing Rioja bands in the off-trade, growing 29% (Nielsen), she added.
“[It] is a proven stepping stone towards the more premium wines from the region,” she said. “Our ‘El Viaje de Ramón’ range combines our passion for innovation and meeting consumer needs – be it for pale pink rosé or a mid-week drinking format – and is a key tool to recruit new consumers to explore everything Ramón Bilbao, and Rioja, has to offer.”
Loftus said the company was fortunate to own quality vineyards at altitude in Rioja Alta and older vines that were “perfect” for wines that need ageing.
“We want to make sure that the quality of the fruit is enhanced by time in barrel, not overwhelmed by it,” she said.
Ramón Bilbao is owned by one of Spain’s largest family-owned drinks companies, the Zamora Company, and is distributed in the UK by Enotria&Coe.

The Archivist – Carol Quinn, Archivist at Irish Distillers

Behind every household name in the world of drinks is a thoroughly thought-out marketing campaign, and often enough, behind those marketing campaigns are true stories. Distillers such as Jameson pour thousands into researching the history of their companies in the hope of finding past events, anecdotes or characters that bring their brands to life.
Carol Quinn has one of the newest jobs in Irish Distillers. Based in the Distillers Cottage in Midleton, Quinn cares for the distilling company’s historical archive, scouring the records created by the firms of John Jameson & Son, John Power & Son and the Cork Distilleries Company and, after they merged in 1966, Irish Distillers itself, dating back to the eighteenth century.
(Photo: Edith Hancock)
With university qualifications in History, Archaeology and Archival Studies and Administration, Carol worked for 16 years as an Archivist for University College Cork, before joining Irish Distillers in 2012.
Quinn manages the physical housing and maintenance of the archives. Once they are cleaned and assessed, the historical artefacts, which include everything from employee sign-in/sign-out books, marketing materials and legal documents, are transferred to one of 5 purpose-built strong rooms in the repository.
Carol’s job is then to alert colleagues to unusual or inetersting information in these records, and how it may be relevant to the current business workings of the company, whether that’s for product development or forming the basis of advertising campaigns that draw on ID’s history.

Drinks company C&C has confirmed it is on track to hit high turnover expectations for this financial year, following “significant” momentum of former Conviviality businesses Bibendum and Matthew Clark, which it acquired last year.
The company issued a trading update this morning saying it was expecting the group’s EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) to be at the upper end of market expectations, while net debt was now “well below” market estimates, within a range of €305m – €312m.
Earning per share – which reflects it ability to generate dividend for investors – was also expected to be around 20%, it said.
The statement said operational delivery, customer service and the cash contribution from Matthew Clark and Bibendum had continued to improve in the second half of the year.
“Matthew Clark and Bibendum have significant underlying momentum, across key financial and performance measures, with good progress made on the identification of synergy benefits,” it said.
There was also positive trading across the Scottish and Irish and branded businesses, which includes Irish cider brands Magners and Bulmers.
Speaking to the drinks business earlier this week, Matthew Clark’s managing director David Philips said the company had been quietly working to get back on track and safeguard the business for the future, following the collapse of its former owner, Conviviality, in April last year. This included rebuilding its wine stocks back to normal levels, consolidating the range, replaying debt and restructuring of the business. It has also reversed much of the centralisation that had occurred under its former owner, and investing in its IT platforms, he said.
Bibendum CEO Michael Saunders told the drinks business in December he was confident about the present and future health of the business, which was back in growth, boosted by the “rock solid” backing of its new owners.
It had “its mojo” back, he told db.

Vinexpo has confirmed dates for its 2020 edition in New York, following the success of its expanded 2019 show in the city last week.
Vinexpo New York 2020 will take place from 2-3 March
Vinexpo New York made its debut in 2018, with a second, larger edition hosted in New York, at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center from 4-5 March.
The show featured more than 400 exhibitors from 26 countries and 3,000 wine and spirits professionals – including a mix of importers, distributors, wholesalers, buyers and e-commerce specialists from over 40 US states and seven Canadian provinces.
Its conference programme included six sessions addressing issues such as global climate change and its impact on the wine industry, emerging technologies in the wine and spirits industry, and trends in the US wine market.
The 2019 edition also saw several new additions, including the WOW! World of Organic Wines pavilion, which hosted more than 20 organic wine producers from five countries; a Wine & Spirit Education Trust Pop-Up classroom; Uncork New York, sponsored by the New York Wine & Grape Foundation; and the Wine Spectator 90+ Showcase and Tasting Bar, highlighting wines to have earned 90 points or higher in its blind tasting reviews.
Cédric Duquenoy, sales director of France’s LGI Wines, said: “It was so wonderful to see the exhibition’s growth this year – there were even more customers and more large retailers. We were so pleased.
“This a big deal for us, and we want to continue to invest in the U.S. market. I believe in the Vinexpo concept because there isn’t another US wine market like it, and New York is a great choice, too.”
Organisers have confirmed that the trade fair will return to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in 2020 for a third edition from 2-3 March, with attendee registration set to open in September.
“Strong attendance figures—and the quality of those attendees—at this year’s show underscore that in just one year, Vinexpo New York has already established itself as an essential event among the most important buyers and decision-makers in the U.S. wine and spirits market,” said Mary Larkin, president of Diversified Communications USA, which produces the show.
“We’re thrilled with the results of this year’s Vinexpo New York, which validate the momentum we felt in the wake of last year’s inaugural show,” added Vinexpo commercial director Mathieu Vanhalst. “Its success reflects the combined efforts of the Vinexpo and Diversified teams and the ever-growing importance of the U.S. market on the global wine and spirits industry.”

Every year Forbes publishes its list of the world’s wealthiest individuals – not those that have made millions, but billions – highlighting the movers and shakers of the business world and where they have made their money.
Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, topped the list with a personal net worth of $131 billion. He was followed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates ($96.5bn), Warren Buffet ($82.5bn), Bernard Arnault ($76bn), the owner of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, and Carlos Slim Helu ($64bn), the richest man in Mexico with a controlling interest in America Movil, Latin America’s biggest mobile telecom firm.
For the first time, Kylie Jenner made the billionaire’s list, who at 21 becomes the youngest self-made billionaire in the world, owing to her Kylie Cosmetics line.
Currently, Forbes reports that there are 2,153 billionaires in the world, 55 fewer than a year ago. Of those, a record 994, or 46%, are poorer (relatively speaking) than they were last year. In total, the ultra-rich are worth $8.7 trillion, down $400 billion from 2018. 
But which drinks trade professionals are mixing with the best of the billionaires?
Here we round up the richest business men and women that have made their fortune in drinks, be it from the beer, wine or spirits industries…

Rare whisky has topped the Knight Frank Luxury Investment Index as the asset with the biggest potential return, having achieved 40% value growth in the past year and a 582% increase since 2009 – the highest of any investment.

The Wealth Report 2019, released yesterday, shows that whisky has topped the Knight Frank Luxury Investment Index (KFLII), rising in value by 40% over the 12 months to Q4 2018.
The Knight Frank Rare Whisky 100 Index, featured for the first time in the KFLII. Compiled by Rare Whisky 101, it contains 100 bottles of the world’s most desirable rare Scotch whisky, and tracks actual UK auction prices of these bottles, finding that over the past ten years values have increased by almost 600%.
The most significant sale of 2018 was a bottle of Macallan 1926, hand painted by Irish artist Michael Dillon, that sold for a record-breaking £1.2million in November. 
This growth was attributed in part of the rising interest in Scotch whisky by the Asian market, with sales of Scotch whisky to India, China and Singapore rising by 44%, 35% and 24% respectively in the first half of 2018, according to the Scotch Whisky Association, with single malts totalling almost 30% of total exports.
“The stunning price growth of rare single malt whiskies shows that the appetite for new ‘alternative’ asset classes remains strong among high-net-worth investors,” said Andrew Shirley, editor of The Wealth Report and the Knight Frank Luxury Investment Index.
“However, we are seeing growth soften for some of the other asset classes in KFLII like classic cars that had been performing exceptionally strongly. This is partly down to a slowdown in activity by speculative investors and a return to a genuine collector-driven market. Despite this, the best examples in each asset class are still setting records when they come up for sale (see below).”
Knight Frank Luxury Investment Index (to Q4 2018)
Whisky was followed by coins (12% annual growth) and wine, which was the third most investible asset have increased in value by 9% over the part 12 months and 147% over the past 10 years.
Andy Simpson, Co-founder Rare Whisky 101, added: “While rare whisky remains a somewhat fledgling asset class compared to some other passion investments, the market for rare and vintage bottles has witnessed extraordinary growth over the past ten years, both in terms of the volume of whisky being traded and the value of that whisky.
“The key to rare whisky’s sustained growth as an asset class, is the passion buyers worldwide share for investing, collecting, and occasionally drinking, some of the best and rarest Scotch whisky ever made.”

Sazerac-owned distillery Barton 1792 has reported its second major equipment failure in a year after around 120,000 gallons of mash spilled from tanks this week, injuring two people.
According to a statement released by the Nelson County Emergency Dipatch at 5pm local time on 5 March, emergency crews arrived on site to discover that a mash tank had failed. They also discovered that a second tank had been punctured while a pipe on a third tank had been damaged, causing the two tanks to leak. The tanks had a capacity of roughly 60,000 gallons.
Two employees received minor injuries during the incident, and were taken to Flaget Memorial Hospital for treatment. They have since been released.
The statement from Nelson County continued: “The leaking fluids flowed into a nearby holding basin. When that basin began to overflow, the liquid then started moving toward a nearby stream. Workers constructed berms [raised barriers] to protect the stream. A clean up crew contracted by Barton’s 1792 was on site and additional resources from the company were also responding.”
Spokesperson for Sazerac, Amy Preske, commented: “On 5 March 2019, we had an incident at Barton 1792 Distillery where the beer well failed. (The beer well is used in the production process to hold the fermented mash before it is distilled.) Currently we do not know the cause of the beer well failure and we are working to secure the area.”
Preske told the drinks business that there was no further update.
This not the first incident of this nature that Barton has dealt with in the past year. In June 2018, 9,000 Bourbon barrels came crashing down when half of one of its storage warehouses collapsed. While no-one was injured in this incident, workers struggled to contain the alcohol spilled and it was reported that Bourbon flowed into a nearby stream for around three hours, contributing to the death of around 800 fish, according to Courier Journal. 
The following month, disaster struck again when the second half of the warehouse collapsed. Due to the barriers in place, no further alcohol was spilled into the local waterways, Sazerac confirmed. A total of 18,000 barrels were involved in the incident.
In January this year, at another Sazerac-owned facility, operations were suspended after a worker was killed in a fall from a suspended walkway. Dennis Layman, 44, died as a result of a blunt force trauma after a fall at Glenmore Distillery in Owensboro, Kentucky.

“Wine is the canary in the coal mine of agriculture,” according to wine writer Jamie Goode when speaking at the Climate Change Leadership conference in Porto.
Introducing a session on ‘Wineries of the Future’ at the conference, Goode said that the wine industry was, “exquisitely sensitive to climate change,” and that if the industry was serious about tackling the issue, a vital step was, “wineries need to be carbon zero.”
As he explained, wineries are “energy hungry”, gobbling up power and water for all manner of uses yet are only used seriously once per year.
He was introducing Roger Boulton from the Department of Viticulture and Enology at the University of California, Davis, who was presenting a talk on ‘Design Solutions for a Self-Sustainable Zero-Carbon Winery’.
The day’s morning sessions included talks from Miguel Torres and others who had talked about ways for wineries to lower carbon emissions and make better use of water and so on.
Boulton explained how it was possible to make a winery entirely carbon neutral and completely off the water and power grid – and could be run on lithium batteries.
Furthermore, this ‘smart winery’ was not a concept that is yet to come to fruition, it has been realised, at UC Davis, in the shape of the ‘Jess S. Jackson Sustainable Winery’.
The 8,500 square-foot building was opened in 2013 and is entirely self supporting, capturing water, sunlight and carbon and recycling them multiple times and, in the case of carbon, creating waste by-products (in the form of calcium carbonate) that can actually be sold on to other industries that need it.
It is the world’s first platinum level LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified winery and was in fact “overdesigned” for LEED, said Boulton. It is so energy efficient, naturally regulating its own temperature for example, it gained three points by not actually doing anything.
Speaking to the drinks business later, Boulton explained this was a winery that could be placed almost anywhere in the world and still function exactly as it should.
The world needs, “carbon negative industries” said Boulton, highlighting the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide and corresponding shrinkage of the Arctic ice cap.
What’s more he said that wineries need to be more honest in “admitting” how much carbon dioxide they produced, active in combatting it and not just sell on credits for someone else to off-set.
In addition to making carbon negative wineries, Boulton suggested the wine industry supported international carbon trading schemes, established “comprehensive” calculators to determine CO2 emissions from fermentation, accept at least “partial ownership” of carbon emissions not just selling credits, fund research projects to look at further ways to sequester CO2 and join forces with the brewing and distilling industries who also are, can and should be looking at carbon capture, especially given their facilities are operating on a far more regular basis than most wineries.
In addition, Boulton raised the point that there is now, finally, a ready market for carbon. The price in California has risen threefold in the last three months.
By capturing carbon given off during fermentation, which is also, it is worth noting, the “richest concentration of CO2 anywhere in the world”, not only can wineries become one less problem to the problem of too much carbon in the atmosphere but can actually be financially recompensed for doing so.

The Institute of Masters of Wine (IMW) has confirmed that Rufus Olins will take over as its new executive director from May, following the departure of Penny Richards last year. 
Rufus Olins began his career as a journalist and editor at The Sunday Times
Richards left the IMW last year after more than five years to take up a new role as managing director of the Aspen Institute in the UK, a nonpartisan forum for values-based leadership and the exchange of ideas.
On finding a suitable replacement for Richards, Adrian Garforth MW, chairman of the IMW, said an “extensive global search” was carried out that resulted in a solid pool of candidates from both in and out of the wine world.
“Rufus was the stand-out candidate in that strong field,” he said. “He comes with vast expertise, especially with membership organisations, which is very exciting for the IMW. I’m delighted Rufus will be joining the team and I look forward to working with him as we move into the next phase of the IMW’s history.”
Olins began his career as a journalist and editor working for The Sunday Times. He went on to become managing director of Lord Heseltine’s Haymarket Brand Media in 2003, then CEO at the World Advertising Research Centre, an international data business for the marketers and academics.
After heading up Newsworks, the membership body for the UK’s national newspaper brands, he joined the Co-op Group as chief membership officer.
“I’m very excited to be joining the Institute of Masters of Wine and building on the excellent work of Penny Richards and the team,” Olins said of his new appointment. “I cannot think of a more important time to join such a multi-faceted industry encompassing geography, science, history, climate, fashion, economics and the sheer pleasure of drinking wine.”
“Nothing is a higher priority than maintaining the highest of standards of the MW award, but there are also exciting opportunities ahead for growth and development. I greatly look forward to working with members, students, supporters, the council and the team to develop the IMW’s activities and influence.’’
Rufus will join the IMW on 28 April 2019.

A wine bar owner in Cornwall has been forced to clarify that his establishment is in fact a wine bar and not a brothel, after his choice of purple drapery gave locals the mistaken impression that it was in fact a house of ill repute.
Purple drapery is apparently the international symbol for a brothel, according to locals in Cornwall
As reported by Cornwall Live, Alan Gilbert, the owner of Trewithen Bistro and Wine Bar in Lostwithiel, has caused quite a stir with his choice of drapery, which has sparked confusion, distrust and debate among locals.
The colour of his curtains, a regal purple, is apparently the international symbol for a brothel, according to some locals, several of whom contacted Gilbert to point out that his interior design choices may have been ill-advised.
Gilbert received an anonymous letter telling him that from the outside the wine bar “looks like a house of ill-repute” from a local who was either warning him of the confusion the drapery could cause, or perhaps seeking clarification of what he could expect from a visit?
Gilbert also received a text from a woman claiming the decor made the bar look “cheap”.
The confusion has since forced the Gilbert to reassure potential patrons that his venue really is a wine bar, and that no illegitimate ongoings were occurring behind its purple-draped doors.
Speaking to the newspaper, Gilbert said: “We opened on February 5 and the building is orange and purple coloured. We decided to have curtains in the window so put them in and opened.
“Then it was mentioned around the town that some people weren’t coming in because they didn’t like the curtains. Apparently it looked dingy and suggested illegitimate goings on, looking like a brothel or a funeral parlour.”
He added: “We take on board other people’s opinions but this has gone past a joke. We’re here creating jobs for local people and trying to improve the town.
“Fortunately the wine bar is doing really well and we’ve even had people coming from as far as Fowey who have joked about coming to look at our ghastly curtains.”
A cautionary tale for wine bar owners, perhaps, to pick the colour of your curtains carefully…

From sommeliers, marketeers, writers, retailers and brewery owners, the UK beer industry is home to a large group of passionate women. To celebrate International Women’s Day, we’ve rounded up some of the top female brewers, or brewsters, making their mark.

Women’s involvement with beer dates back millennia. Throughout the 9,000-year history of fermented drinks, archaeologists and historians have charted the role of women, both in the production and sale of beer.
In Medieval Britain, it was women that took charge of the production of beer, both for consumption within the home and for commercial sale. Referred to as alewives, brewesses or brewsters, brewing gave women a relatively lucrative financial means of supporting themselves in an age when they enjoyed neither the cultural nor legal standing of men. As brewing gradually became commercialised following the first major outbreak of the plague in 1347–50, the industry started to narrow and women were increasingly marginalised as the guilds took hold.
The presence of women in beer is evident in word etymology. The first written mention of the world ‘alewife’ is recorded in England in 1393, while historian Judith M. Bennett, author of Ale, Beer and Brewsters in England: Women’s Work in a Changing World, 1300–1600 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), notes how the term ‘brewster’ has disappeared from contemporary English when once it was a term that specifically referred to a female brewer.
Fast forward to 2019, with groups such as Women on Tap and Ladies that Beer, and initiatives such as International Women’s Collaboration Brew Day, today’s brewsters and female beer drinkers are celebrating women’s involvement in the industry.
Brewhouse and Kitchen marketing manager Gail Bunn said that she’s seen a rise in the number of women entering the industry and believes the changing attitudes in society are key reason for the change.
She said: “Women have greater ability to distinguish between high numbers of aromas and flavours, which is key to success in craft brewing. Along with this, beer companies are more aware of the importance of female beer drinkers and women now feel more comfortable to drink beer, attend pubs and contribute to the growth of the industry. We’re seeing this reflected in both our customers base and growth of women participating in our Brewing Academy, which fosters successful careers in brewing.”
“On International Women’s Day, we want to celebrate women’s contributions to the industry, encourage new ladies to consider the trade by introducing them to the brewing process, but most of all to just make the wonderful world of craft beer more approachable to women, and to encourage women to enjoy the wealth of styles and flavours available.”
Take a look at our round-up of female brewers paving the way in the UK.

Diageo has recruited its first female coopering apprentices, acknowledging that while the ancient craft of creating oak casks has been part of Scotch whisky for centuries, it’s an art that has traditionally been dominated by men.
First-year coopering apprentices Angela Cochrane and Kirsty Olychick
First-year coopering apprentices Angela Cochrane and Kirsty Olychick have been recruited by leading Scotch distiller Diageo at its Cambus Cooperage in Clackmannanshire.
The news marked the start of Scottish Apprenticeship Week and coincided with International Women’s Day (8 March), with Diageo celebrating having women employed in every part of its business in Scotland, from senior management roles, to distillery managers, master blenders, electrical and mechanical engineers, and in the traditional crafts of coppersmith and coopering.
Former psychiatric nurse, Angela Cochrane, 31, gained the coveted spot on the Cambus Cooperage apprenticeship programme after noticing the advert on Facebook.
She said: “I researched a bit about the trade online and thought it sounded like a really interesting career option, so I knew I had to go for it. It’s a lot more complex than I thought it would be and I’m knackered when I get in at night but everything from handling the barrels to swinging the hammer is already starting to feel a lot more natural.
“I’ve never been put off by gender stereotypes. I don’t think that should stop anyone from doing what they want to do. And knowing you’re contributing to the growing whisky industry is an amazing feeling.”
Kirsty Olychick, 38, meanwhile, left her home in Canada to pursue a career in the Scotch whisky industry.
“Coming into a male-dominated workplace didn’t put me off at all, in fact I found it really empowering to be one of the first women to take up the craft and make my mark in history,” she said. “It’s such an exciting prospect to think that I’ll be contributing to the next generation of Scotch. You shouldn’t let anything hold you back.”
Angela and Kirsty are part of team of 16 coopering apprentices in the Coopering School at Diageo Cambus, learning the skills of a cooper over the course of a four-year apprenticeship.
Coopering tutor, John Carberry, added: “There is incredible precision involved in the cooper’s craft. Our apprentices need to master a blend of strength, skill and patience, learning how to hand repair casks with no glue or nails, as well as calculate different oak depths, ratios and specific measurements.
“The craft of making and rejuvenating the casks is something that has to be cultivated and refined so it’s great to see our apprentices are so passionate about the craft. The traditional coopering skills take 10 years to master but once mastered, it’s a rewarding career which will last a lifetime.”
Diageo opened the £10 million state-of-the art Cambus Cooperage in 2011. It is now able to produce over 400,000 casks each year.

A new company has been set up to replace the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group, which Mario Batali co-founded in 1998 with restaurateurs Joe Bastianich and Lidia Bastianich.
As reported by Business Times, Batali’s interests in the company were officially dissolved on Wednesday, more than a year after several women accused Batali of sexual harassment and assault.
Tanya Bastianich Manuali and her brother, Joe Bastianich, have bought Batali’s shares in all the restaurants, but have not disclosed the financial terms.
Bastianich Manuali, who will lead an as-yet-unnamed company to replace the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group, said Batali will “no longer profit from the restaurants in any way, shape or form”.
The new company will operate the group’s remaining 16 restaurants under a new management and financial structure.
Batali is also selling his shares in New York’s Eataly, the Italian market concept founded by Italian businessman Oscar Farinetti in 2007, which has since grown from a converted Vermouth factory in Turin to include venues in New York, Chicago, Milan Copenhagan and Dubai.
A spokesman for Eataly confirmed that it was in the process of acquiring Batali’s “minority interest in Eataly USA”.
ALLEGATIONS
In 2017, Batali voluntarily stepped down from his restaurant empire and was been fired from ABC’s cooking-based talk show The Chew in light of the allegations, following a report first published by New York’s Eater. Four women made allegations against the chef over incidents spanning two decades, with more later coming forward.
Batali had already admitted that the claims “match up” with his behaviour, despite not knowing his accusers, and released a statement in which he not only apologised to fans, but took “full responsibility” for his actions.
The statement read: “I have made many mistakes and I am so very sorry that I have disappointed my friends, my family, my fans and my team. My behaviour was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility. Sharing the joys of Italian food, tradition and hospitality with all of you, each week, is an honour and privilege. Without the support of all of you – my fans – I would never have a forum in which to expound upon this. I will work every day to regain your respect and trust – mb.”

Here are the top 10 most influential women in mainland China’s wine trade that have helped shape today’s market either in domestic wine production, imported wine sector or the fast expanding e-commerce sector.

In the imported wine sector, Aline Bao from the country’s leading importer COFCO Wine and Wine, and Cynthia Yang, tasked with global wine procurement at China’s second largest E-commerce giant JD.com, are key decision-makers that affect the wines sold in China in physical retail and online stores.
Looking inward to China’s own wine production, we are pleased to see four key women in China’s Ningxia, Xinjiang and Shanxi are lifting the country’s reputation as a wine producer, with their well crafted wines, be it from Silver Heights, Grace Vineyard, Tiansai Vineyards or Kanaan Winery.
Education is another key factor in any wine market’s growth. Hence, we selected two leading educators that helped to spread wine knowledge on the mainland. Of course, there’s also another rising online influencer who is said to “have converted more people to wine drinkers than any other retailer, media, or platform in China”.
The ranking is in no particular order and focuses only on personalities in mainland China, hence excluding Hong Kong’s powerful trio, Jeannie Cho Lee MW, Debra Meiburg MW and Sarah Heller MW.

Chester Osborn, chief winemaker at d’Arenberg is to host a major exhibition of Surrealist Salvador Dalí’s bronze sculptures at his creative space, The Cube, in McLaren Vale.
Dalí was fascinated with the concept of time and the power it held over mankind
Taking place from 9 March to 31 May, the exhibition will include 23 bronze sculptures and graphic artworks created by the eccentric Spanish Surrealist artist, including sculptures of his famous melting watches.
Dalí, who died in 1989, believed that time was more powerful than man and a controlling force in our daily lives.
He described his iconic soft watches as, “nothing else than the tender, extravagant, solitary, paranoiac-critical Camembert of time and space”.
Dalí’s Space Elephant scuplture will be on display
Valued at over AU$6 million, the sculptures have been exhibited in major cities around the world, and are on loan from the Dalí Universe in Switzerland.
The bronzes were made using a process known as the ‘lost-wax technique’, which allows anything that can be modeled in wax to be accurately converted into metal.
Among the Dalí sculptures on display will be Dance of Time II, based on his melting clock motif, conceived in 1979 and first cast in 1984.
Another sculpture to feature in the show will be Dalí’s Space Elephant – a bronze elephant with giraffe legs carrying an obelisk, which appears in his 1946 work, The Temptation of St. Anthony.
The show will also include paintings by Australian artist Charles Billich, whose works hang in the Vatican, White House and the United Nations headquarters.
Born Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dalí i Domènech in Catalonia in 1904, Dalí is regarded as one of the most important artists of the 20th century alongside Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol.
Best known for his Surrealist paintings of melting watches, Dalí’s expansive artistic repertoire included film, sculpture, jewellery and photography.
The flamboyant polymath collaborated with film director Alfred Hitchcock on a dream sequence in his 1945 psychoanalytic thriller Spellbound, starring Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck.
One of the leaders of Surrealism, which leant heavily on the studies of Sigmund Freud, Dalí became inextricably linked with the artistic movement.
As will his Dance of Time II sculpture
His 1931 painting, Persistence of Memory, is considered one of the most important Surrealist images ever created.
“Dalí would have been inspired and enchanted by the d’Arenberg estate. He loved seeing his artistic creations displayed at unusual, surreal locations, and the d’Arenberg Cube is precisely that,” said James Sanders, international project manager of The Dalí Universe.
“This unique and inspiring space provides the perfect backdrop for an exhibition of important Dalí sculptures and graphic artworks
“In the wake of Salvador Dalí came a generation of fine Australian Surrealist artists such as Brett Whiteley, James Gleeson and Charles Billich.
“Dalí has had a strong and lasting legacy in this country. We hope that many Australian art lovers and members of the public will come and enjoy this exhibition,” he added.
In 2017, db reported that Dalí’s 1970s paean to wine, The Wines of Gala, had been rebound and refreshed by publisher Taschen into a glossy coffee table book.
d’Arenberg’s chief winemaker, Chester Osborn, is an avid art collector. Earlier this year he opened up to db about his own artistic endeavours.

The Sun reports that last year, the duo purchased Spanish restaurant Galicia on London’s Portobello Road for an alleged £1.5 million. Located at number 323 near the junction with Chesterton Road, Galicia was founded by José Nieto Alborés and Eduardo Lage Porto in 1999. It closed its doors in April 2018.
A source told The Sun that Sheeran and Camp are hoping that the site will be ready by the end of next month.
“Builders are hard at work making over the venue so it will be ready by the end of April.
“The name is up in the air, as locals liked Galicia, but Ed is keen to put his own stamp on it.”
Details about the food and drink due to be offered at the site have yet to be released, nor have the reports been officially confirmed by Sheeran. While he has not put his name to a public bar before, in 2017, the singer-songwriter did reveal that he has built a secret tunnel to a private pub underneath his home in North London.
In an interview with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, Sheeran said: “I’ve built a pub. Like, I had a bar before, a bar where you could pour beers but now this has like a selection of beers, which is cool”. He has also revealed that he bought an villa in Umbria purely because it had a vineyard.
Last year, after performing at Cardiff’s Principality Stadium as part of his Divide world tour, Sheeran was spotted at Park House Restaurant and Wine Bar alongside fellow performer Lionel Richie. The pair drank all night long, racking up a sizeable wine bill which included a £750 bottle of Penfolds Grange 1997.

Having announced the launch of her wine brand last month, American actress Sarah Jessica Parker will follow in Brangelina’s footsteps by making a Provence rosé.
Sarah Jessica Parker will be making a Provence rosé in collaboration with Tim Lightbourne (left) and Rob Cameron of New Zealand winery Invivo
Parker is collaborating with Tim Lightbourne and Rob Cameron of New Zealand winery Invivo on the project, which will launch with a Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc and Provence rosé.
Speaking exclusively to db during a trip to London last week, Cameron said: “The rosé category is also on fire, so we wanted to do a rosé, which will likely from Provence as SJP loves Provence rosé and that’s what’s popular. We’re talking to a few producers in the region at the moment.”
The Sex and the City star’s wine brand has yet to be named, though unlike Invivo’s other celebrity collaborator – Graham Norton – SJP won’t be calling the brand after herself.
“We haven’t finalised the brand name yet but it won’t be her name and there won’t be any shoes or pink on the label – SJP was adamant about that.
“She doesn’t want the brand to look too feminine or targeted at women – they will be wines for everyone. Sarah is going to be very hands on with the label design,” Cameron revealed.
As to how the project came about, Lightbourne told db that the original idea came from Invivo, born of a desire to capitalise on the growth of wine in the US market.
“The US is the fastest growing wine market in the world and we see huge opportunities there, which is why we wanted to collaborate with an American star on a wine.
“We sat down and wrote a list of all the people in the US we’d love to make wine with and Sarah Jessica Parker came out on top.
“We approached her through a mutual contact and asked if she’d like to work with us on creating a wine brand. She loved the idea and we knew she was the right fit for us straight away.
“We sent her some of our wines and talked about the different possibilities for wines within her range. New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is growing in the US, so it made sense to begin with that,” Lightbourne said.
“We met in New York in December to talk about the project in more detail in her shoe showroom. She’s keen on rich, full bodied, buttery whites, so we won’t be making a conventional Kiwi Sauvignon – there might be some malolactic fermentation and barrel ageing.
SJP announced the news of her wine brand with a pair of wellies on Instagram
“At Invivo we’re very focused on texture, and that will play an important role in SJP’s wine. It will still be a young, fresh wine but a portion of oak will feature in the blend,” he added.
Like Graham Norton’s wine range, which includes a Prosecco and an Aussie Shiraz, the plan with SJP’s range is to include popular styles from all over the world, with a California Chardonnay likely to be the third wine in her collection.
The first wines will go on sale in September and they’ve already attracted a lot of interest from buyers in the UK wanting to take them on before they have even been made.
“SJP announced the news by posting a pair of gum boots in her shoe showroom on Instagram. It got over 85,000 likes, which shows the kind of reach she has. It’s hard for most wineries to achieve that level of engagement,” Cameron said.
“It’s very hard to build a wine brand from scratch, so we want to create brands will well known figures that fit into people’s lifestyles.
“It’s a different way of doing things, which people seem to like. We don’t have a long family history, so we needed to create our own story and we recognise that most consumers want wine to be fun and interactive.
“The industry has made wine scary to consumers so we want to demystify wine and bring the fun back. Winemakers are viewed as mystical creatures with magical capabilities but putting a blend together is not as hard as it’s made out to be.
“We’re really picky about who we work with – it has to be the right fit for us. This isn’t ACDC putting their name on Bourbon and Coke; it’s much more granular,” he added.
Lightbourne is planning on moving to the US in order to be closer to the project. Once the base wines have been made he will bring samples over from Marlborough to New York and he and Cameron will do the blending with SJP there.
“We’ve always been a collaborative brand. Shortly after we launched we worked with local musicians and fashion brands in New Zealand. To mark this evolution we recently changed our name from Invivo Wines to Invivo & Co, partly to honour our 600 different shareholders,” Lightbourne said.

After storming to unprecedented heights over the past three years, 2019 continues to see the Liv-ex 1000 struggle to make any headway with Burgundy taking the biggest hit.
The broadest measure of the market Liv-ex has, the index dipped 0.9% in February after declining 0.3% in January, as did the Fine Wine 100 as previously reported.
All of the sub-indices declined last month with the exception of the Bordeaux Legends 500 which gained 0.9%.
Intriguingly, it was the Burgundy 150 index that has been the most successful which was hit hardest, down a frighteningly tangible 3%.
Liv-ex reported that demand in Asia during the New Year break had been poorer than usual.
It is of course possible that this is a blip and normal service will resume shortly. Many markets ‘pause for breath’ after prolonged periods of big growth and sometimes settle back a little before kicking up another gear.
But if the indices continue to fall over the course of several months with ‘Brexit’ uncertainty still casting a pall over many markets and an en primeur campaign that could stall and drive the market still lower without much UK input, the situation does not look too terribly settled for fine wine this quarter.

Château Haut-Bailly has revealed the new names of its second and third labels as well as some slight design tweaks.
The Pessac-Léognan-based estate’s second label, known as ‘La Parde de Haut-Bailly’ since 1967, is being renamed, ‘Haut Bailly · II’.
As well as a nod to the second generation of the Wilmer family that took over in the wake of Bob Wilmer’s death in 2017, it also re-introduces the ‘dot’ which was a feature of the château’s labels until 1985.
The third label, previously known simply as ‘Pessac-Léognan’ since 1987 has been rebranded as ‘HB’, in order to make it “more directly identifiable in the…range”.
The label of the grand vin remains the same. The 2018 vintage will be the first to bear these new labels.
Earlier this year, the estate announced it was investing in a major revamp of its cellars.

British heavy metal band Iron Maiden and Stockport brewery Robinsons Brewery have released new saké lager,  the first lager in the band’s best-selling Trooper beer range.
Iron maiden has released its first sake lager, Sun and Steel
The new Sun and Steel lager is a 4.8% ABV pilsner-style, double fermented lager using saké  yeast, which the brewery said was one of the most complex beers it had ever produced.
Iron Maiden’s lead singer Bruce Dickinson was inspired to come up with the unusual hybrid brew two years ago after meeting Maiden fan George Yusa, who owns a 300 year old family run saké brewery, Okunomatsu Saké Brewery in Fukushima, Japan.
The yeast, which was supplied by Yusa and cultivated by Robinson’s head brewer Martyn Weeks, after Weeks obtained permission from the Japanese government to use it in brewing, is added to the traditionally brewed lager, which then undergoes a second fermentation.
It produces what the brewery describes as a “delicate, subtle fruit flavour infused into a pilsner style lager”.
Dickinson said the “crazy idea” to make a saké infused lager had been an exciting project to work on.
“I know Martyn and the team at Robinsons have had to become mad scientists to make this work but the end result is a really unique hybrid beer that tastes fantastic. Trooper fans have been asking for a lager, and here it is. I bet you would never have guessed we would do it like this though!”
Robinsons and Iron Maiden released their first beer, ‘Trooper’, in 2013, and have since released five limited edition extensions to the range, including a porter, and a golden ale brewed to support Help for Heroes, called Light Brigade. 
Sun and Steel, which will be available in May, is named after the Iron Maiden song that inspired by the life of Japanese Samurai Miyamoto Musashi, that features in the 1983 Piece of Mind Album album.

Hosted by the drinks business and sister title The Spirits Business, the tasting will take place at 2pm on Monday 18 March at ProWein in Düsseldorf, Germany.
A panel of experts will taste a selection of the world’s most famous XO Cognacs, and compare these to high-end brandy made in China at the event.
The tasting will allow industry insiders to assess how the flavour profile of established Cognac brands compares with super-premium brandies made in China, principally Koya XO, which is aged for 15 years.
“As high-class brandy emerges from markets around the world, it will be interesting to see how disruptive players compare to the established names in Cognac,” said Amy Hopkins, editor of The Spirits Business, who will co-chair the tasting with Patrick Schmitt MW, editor-in-chief of the drinks business.
“Cognac producers are increasingly seeking to establish a point of difference and innovate, meaning cross-category competition will inevitably rise.
“This tasting will seek to discover how established XOs stand up to brandies that are less restricted when it comes to production regulations, and are growing in terms of both quality and popularity.”

An expedition is underway to salvage 50 bottles of wine and/or spirits from a British ship torpedoed off the coast of Cornwall in 1918.," 11th March, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/03/ww1-wine-to-be-salvaged-from-uk-shipwreck/,"11th March, 2019

An expedition is underway to salvage 50 bottles of wine and/or spirits from a British ship torpedoed off the coast of Cornwall in 1918.
Organised by Cookson Adventures with the aid of various maritime and archaeological entities, the expedition will survey the wreck further and then attempt to salvage around 50 bottles potentially worth several million pounds.
The ship in question was a British cargo ship sailing from Bordeaux to the UK with a cargo of wine when it was torpedoed by a German U-boat in 1918.
Today she lies in 100 metres of water off the Cornish coast and an initial dive by maritime exploration company 10994 Ltd to locate the wreck also revealed her cargo of “several hundred” bottles of wine and possibly Champagne and spirits, the majority of which seem to be intact.
Phase Two of the project will see several days of further mapping and surveying before the salvage work begins.
Several of the bottles will be ‘accessed’ with Coravin upon recovery to determine their potability and then it seems likely several will be sent to the University of Dijon for further testing and the National Maritime Museum of Cornwall in Falmouth has apparently expressed an interest in housing some in its collection.
Régis D. Gougeon Professor of Chemistry & Enology and Adjunct Director of the Institute de la Vigne et du Vin (IUVV) Jules Guyot at the University of Burgundy in Dijon, said: “This is an extremely exciting project, which definitely falls within our expertise and interest for the chemical messages brought by very old samples of wines, spirits and other beverages, as shown for instance in our recent joint research on Baltic Champagnes with Prof. Philippe Schmitt-Kopplin from Technical University of Munich, and Prof. Philippe Jeandet from University of Reims.
“There is no doubt that the samples extracted from the site will have great historical significance as we are not aware of such a wide and aged variety of wine, champagne and brandy being found before in UK waters. This will be hugely important for our ongoing research and for world history as we know it.”
Cookson Adventures is also offering one of its clients the chance to be there alongside a documentary team and various other experts from the worlds of wine and archaeology.
Adam Sebba, CEO of Cookson Adventures, said: “We don’t consider ourselves a luxury travel company or an adventure travel company – we like to do things differently. That’s why this is precisely the type of unique experience we like to build for our clients. It’s a one-of-a-kind opportunity to be a part of one of the most significant historical discoveries of the century.
“The rarity of such a cargo is unprecedented and we’re waiting with baited breath to dive and see if we can recover the wine. The dive will be challenging but, by working with a team of leading experts in a number of specialist fields, we are confident that we can extract the prized artefacts intact.”

One of the UK’s biggest fruit importers, Richard Hochfeld, and English distiller, Foxhole Spirits, have teamed up to tackle food waste, launching a gin made from some of the 1.4 million punnets of table grapes thrown out each year.
The gin, called, Hyke, is set to launch on Global Recycling Day on 18 March. Working with Richard Hochfeld, Sussex-based Foxhole is using surplus internationally-sourced table grapes, which can’t be sold as fresh, to make its gin.
It is estimated that 713 tonnes of table grapes per year, the equivalent of 1.4 million punnets, are not suitable to be consumed fresh. This represents 2.7% out of the total volume produced which is around 500,000 tonnes, according to figures supplied by Foxhole.
Foxhole already uses wine grapes (vitis vinifera) in the production of its flagship gin. While a separate company, it works closely with Bolney Wine Estate to create a gin using the by-products of the winemaking process. It presses the unused juice out of the grapes before it’s then fermented and distilled, a process it deems important in reducing wastage in the English wine industry.
Its new gin, however, will have more of an international flavour, with a blend of botanicals which include juniper, coriander, myrrh, South African rooibos, angelica root, angelica seed, orris root, liquorice, aniseed, cumin, lemon zest, bay leaf, nigella seed, green cardamom and black cardamom. The spirit is said to have a “rich, sweet citrus” character with “spice and complex aromatics”.
Hyke, which has an ABV of 40%, will be available in a 70cl bottle format to the on-trade though Highball Brands, Foxhole’s UK distribution partner. Director of drinks at sales and marketing consultancy Scotch + Limon, Jamie Jones, has also created three signature serves using the new spirit.
Hyke has also gone on sale exclusively in 300 Tesco stores nationwide, priced at £24 per 50cl bottle. The UK supermarket is attempting to halve its food waste by 2030.
James Oag-Cooper, managing director and co-founder of Foxhole Spirits commented: “We knew that there was something special that could and ‘should’ be done with this quality by-product, so we applied our expertise and craftsmanship to the challenge. The result is a totally unique product which tastes exceptionally delicious, is beautifully presented, sustainably conscious and yet still affordable.”
The gin bottle is made from recyclable material with each detail of the process and materials considered for their environmental impact where possible. Richard Hochfeld sources grapes from 13 countries around the world and as part of its quality control measures, has a surplus of around 166 million table grapes.
Other gins made using grapes or grape distillate include Chapel Down’s spirit range, Chilgrove gin, Four Pillars’ Bloody Shiraz Gin and France’s G’Vine and Osmoz gins.

UK wine retailer Majestic saw its website crash on Saturday following high demand for one of its wines, after the bottle was mentioned on ITV’s  James Martin’s Saturday Morning.

On Saturday, the retailer tweeted that its Nero Oro Appassimento 2017/18 was “flying off its shelves” after the “stellar mention” by chef James Martin on the popular TV cookery programme. 
Martin described the wine as  “absolutely fantastic – and the cheapest of the lot!”
The wine retails for £9.99 for a single bottle or £7.99 in a mixed case.

Majestic told db the wine sold out in a number of stores over the weekend although because it had buffer stock in its online warehouse, it was able to satisfy online demand. It said it also secure some extra stock at short notice to distribute to stores.
“The wine has been something of a cult classic among staff and in-the-know customers,” a spokesman said. “As far as we are aware it’s the first ever Appassimento Nero d’Avala from Sicily, so it’s great to see it having its moment in the sun.”
However it admitted the sales spike was not as high as for the “Porta 6 wine effect”, which saw the busiest hour in its website trading history in 2015 after the wine was mentioned by Susie Barrie MW on BBC’s Saturday Kitchen.
Majestic reported that it took over 1,000 orders for the Tinta Roriz, Castelão and Touriga Nacional blend by midday and had completely sold out three hours after the show had finished. Over the course of the whole weekend, it took orders for more than 30,000 bottles of the wine, which comes from the Vidigal winery near Lisbon and caused Majestic to order all the remaining stock of the 2012 vintage and order a shipment six times larger than the previous consignment to meet demand.

Casa Fofó follows De Cecco’s tenure at Pidgin, which was opened by James Ramsden and Sam Herlihy in Hackney in 2015.
Named after De Cecco’s grandfather, Casa Fofó will serve a five to seven course tasting menu that changes daily, with dishes influenced by cuisines from across the globe.
Served on ceramics made by Sam Marks, a menu of small bites will offer diners dishes such as beef fat pommes darphin, and a tempura shiso leaf with retired dairy cow beef tartare and XO sabayon.
The main menu will feature dishes such as: almond tortello in cock crab; brown butter “tom yum” broth; a yeast and shoaxing wine glazed Middle White pork; tomato sambal-marinated lettuce and sweet-and-sour peanut jus; and a Mah Kwan pepper croqueline with shio koji mascarpone, lovage and berries.

Beginning his career as a kitchen porter at an Italian restaurant in Amsterdam, De Cecco has worked at two-Michelin-starred restaurant Perbellini in Verona, Tetsuya’s in Sydney and Galvin at Windows in London.
On opening Casa Fofó, De Cecco said it will be a “very challenging” but “exciting moment” in his career.
Casa Fofó will open in April.

db heads to Skylon on London’s Southbank to test-drive its new menu, devised by Finnish-born chef Helena Puolakka, gorging on cured salmon on rye, fresh pappardelle in a smoked tomato sauce with creamy goat’s cheese and a heavenly chocolate tart.
Steak tartare
The concept: Skylon is a riverside restaurant on London’s Southbank offering 180 degree views of the Thames from the first floor of the Royal Festival Hall and named after one of the original structures built for the 1951 Festival of Britain. With its tourist-friendly location, it attracts a mixed crowd of theatre-goers, tourists that pour in from nearby Waterloo and Londoners alike, but its fare is far from focused on entertaining the masses. Flying somewhat under the radar, a concise, clean and innovative menu, refreshed last month by incoming executive chef Helena Puolakka, awaits those in the know. A place to dine, no doubt, but one that also offers a spacious and buzzing bar, with excellent views to boot, for a liquid pitstop.
Chef Helena Puolakka
Chef Helena Puolakka (a regular on Masterchef, Ready Steady Cook (Finland) and BBC’s Saturday Kitchen) took over as its new executive chef in September of last year. Her experience includes time spent at the three Michelin-starred restaurant Pierre Gagnaire at the Hotel Balzac, in Paris, and a stint at Pierre Koffmann’s three Michelin-starred La Tante Claire in London.
She joined D&D London in 2007 as executive chef at Skylon, where she stayed for six years. This was followed by a move to Cirrus Inns, where she was culinary director, and the Royal Opera House, coming full circle by returning to D&D London, and Skylon, in 2017. Last month, a brand new menu was launched to herald her return, which also brought with it a revamp of its decor, and a doing away with the previous grill/restaurant split that had seen two menus offered across dining space. Now, the same menu is offered across the entire restaurant, taking its offer up a notch and making it an all together more formal, but not stuffy, affair. A brunch and pre-theatre menu is offered during the day and early evening.
As well as being executive chef at Skylon, Puolakka is also chef patron at D&D’s French-Nordic restaurant Aster in Victoria, where she also curated the Aster Chef Series, a series of dinners in collaboration with some of the world’s best chefs, including Angela Hartnett, Tom Kitchin and Niklas Ekstedt – a concept she hopes to bring to Skylon.
The decor: Coinciding with Puolakka’s return, Skylon’s decor has been given a much-needed refresh, bringing the high-ceilinged space up to date with a more contemporary, laid back feel. A central bar meanwhile is is an artfully-lit by a fluffy cloudscape that hovers high above, creating a comforting and creative centrepiece. However Skylon’s big draw is its spectacular views, with floor-to-ceiling windows offering a panoramic vista of London’s Southbank from which to take in the river front and bustling embankment.
Skylon’s view across the Thames
The food: Originally from the south-west coast of Finland, Puolakka spent her summers “foraging, fishing and living off the land”, which she says prompted her ambition to become a chef, and informed a philosophy in food that she follows to this day. That is, working with fresh, locally-sourced produce. Her latest menu, while concise in its composition, is filled with British ingredients that have been given a Scandi twist, while influence by her French culinary training, such as a starter of slow cooked Chichester wood pigeon with beetroot crème fraiche, chestnuts and kale (£11).
Highlights include the cured var salmon, dill pickles, sweet rye toast (£10), which presented as a generous slab of salmon accompanied by a thin finger of rye toast. A plate of North Atlantic halibut carpaccio meanwhile came piled high, strewn with Lilliput capers and a fennel and lemon dressing (£12). A new addition to the menu is the Cobble Lane cured charcuterie platter, featuring British meats cut, cured and smoked in Cobble Lane Cured shop in Islington, a nod to Puolakka’s preference for locally sourced produce.
On to mains, meat eaters are well catered for, but vegetarians and vegans are also given careful consideration, with four dishes offered (one vegan). Thick ribbons of silky smooth fresh pappardelle (£15) arrived strewn with miniature peppadew peppers and roasted tomatoes, topped with a quenelle of soft goats cheese. A warming Brixham fish pie with winter greens (£19) was a well executed classic; comforting on a drizzly Thursday evening. A side of tender stem broccoli in lemon oil (£4.50) and a green salad with mustard vinaigrette (£4.50) completed the line up.
Other options include the Pot au Feu of ox cheeks with slow cooked winter roots, horseradish tartar (£21) and free-range chicken breast with fingerling potatoes, lemon rosemary salt (£19). Grill options include 42-day aged rib eye steak (£34) and grilled native lobster with smoked potato salad and lobster bearnaise (£21/£42). New sharing dishes include Highland venison wellington with braised red cabbage (£54) and a Chateaubriand with slow cooked endive, Roscoff onions, sage with madeira sauce (£64).
If you make it as far as dessert, expect British classics such as sticky toffee pudding and apple pie. The bitter chocolate tart with raspberry and pistachio comes recommended (£9).
Cured var salmon, dill pickles, sweet rye toast
The drinks: Beverage manager Alfonso Cimmino is the man in the know when it comes to drinks. The smiley sommelier, a Napoli native, strives to offer not only the classics, but lesser-known wines from undiscovered regions and indigenous grapes, with a necessarily patriotic slant on his home country of Italy.
Formerly a sommelier at Gary Rhodes’ restaurant, and later Jason Atherton’s City Social, Cimmino joined Skylon two years ago, which he says requires a higher level of adaptability compared to his previous posts. His customers sway from casual theatre-goers and day-tripping tourists to high-spending business diners with a company credit card. His wine list reflects a need for balance, with a healthy by-the-glass offer, starting from £5 and rising to a lofty £24.50 for a Chassagne-Montrachet 1er Cru from Burgundy. By the bottle, highlights include big hitters including the Super Tuscans Ornallaia (1990, £395) and Tignanello (2011, £380), as well as gems from Spanish trailblazer Alvaro Palacios and Rolland Michel’s Argentine estate Clos de Los Siete.
“The list is always changing, but I always have a balance between well known producers and lesser-known regions and grapes,” said Cimmino. “My main target is to offer my customers something that they have never tasted before.”
Indeed, the more adventurous imbiber will find plenty to excite in the form of a Greek Kotsifali from Domaine Lyrarakis from Crete (£39), a 2017 Greco di Tufo from Campania (£55) and a 2011 from Domaine de Bargylus in Syria (a Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot blend), at the ambitious price of £99.
A broad selection of English sparkling wines and Champagne are also available, somewhat limited by the glass, but with bottles available from the likes of Krug and Drappier to Nyetimber, Hambledon and Gusbourne.
Don’t leave without: Gazing wistfully at the view, especially at sunset. There are few restaurants in London that offer such a setting, where you don’t have to book long in advance or take out a mortgage to afford a meal. What’s more, it’s perfectly located for a quick getaway via Waterloo, for when you’d rather not fight for a table in Soho or transverse the hell that is Oxford Street.
Last Word: It’s tempting to discount a restaurant that has such an unappealing frontage as the Royal Festival Hall, which, despite its rich cultural benefits, is an ugly building. Its saving grace is its prime location, overlooking the Thames, which makes you forget that you are sitting in a grey, drab, uninspiring box of a building with little charm or character. But one mustn’t judge a book by its cover. It’s what’s inside that counts. For Skylon, that means stunning views, a slick setting, innovative menu and an attentive team. It’s a little on the pricey side, admittedly, but not so much that you feel ripped off. And the quality, in my opinion, justifies the cost. Don’t expect any change from £100 for a three-course meal for two with wine, but for its location, presentation and panache, you could do worse than Skylon – an overlooked gem. We left with our bellies full and our eyes open.

Pubs in the UK saw a boost last month as like-for-like sales grew on the back of strong booze sales, but restaurant chains suffered a 1.7% fall from the same time last year.
Pubs
According to the monthly stats from Coffer Peach Business Tracker, managed pubs saw strong trading, with like-for-like sales up 1.4% in February, compared to the previous year. Drink-led pubs, particularly in London, performed most strongly, with booze sales up 3.5%.
Pubs in the capital saw like-for-like growth of 3%, compared to 1% of the overall on-premise, while those outside the M25, pub growth saw more muted growth of 0.9%.
However, restaurant groups had a less than positive month, with like-for-like sales down 1.7% across the board as food sales fell 0.9%. In London there was a 2.2% decline, compared to 1.2% outside the M25.
Overall like-for-like on-premise sales growth in London was 1.0% over the month, compared to just 0.1% outside the M25, where the difference in performance was less stark, with pubs’ like-for-likes up 0.9% and restaurants down 1.2%.
Karl Chessell, director of CGA, the business insight consultancy that produces the Tracker, in partnership with Coffer Group and RSM said the mini-heatwave at the end of the month helped sales across the board, but did not make up for the cold start to the month.
“The mini heatwave towards the end of the month certainly boosted pub trading, and also helped restaurant sales, as people enjoyed the unseasonal sunshine, but unfortunately it wasn’t enough to move the whole market much. The branded restaurant sector is still suffering from declining sales, and despite a better end to the month, early February was generally poor for restaurants,” he said.
“Even within the managed pub market food sales are under pressure. The trading uplift in February has essentially come from increased drink sales, which were up 3.5%, against a 0.9% fall in food.”
Mark Sheehan, managing director of Coffer Corporate Leisure argued that there was no “no quick fix” for the restaurant sector, with oversupply in some areas – particularly inside the M25 – unlikely to see a change.

“Ross is a highly knowledgeable and capable brewer, passionate about brewing with an exceptional technical ability and flair for innovation,” managing director Matt Starbuck said.
“He is a great advocate for brewing as a career opportunity, encouraging the development of others and driving forward our brewing apprentice scheme.
“We are delighted to make this appointment as we look ahead to an exciting next chapter for Greene King brewing.”

Albino Armani has been unanimously re-elected as the president of Italy’s Consorzio Delle Venezie DOC at a general meeting held last week.
Albino Armani, president of Italy’s Consorzio Delle Venezie DOC
The Consorzio DOC delle Venezie was founded in 2017 with the primary aim of raising the profile of Pinot Grigio, lifting it from an IGP classification to a DOC and ensuring quality production.
The Delle Venezie DOC covers the entire Northeastern part of Italy, including the administrative territories of Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Veneto regions and the autonomous province of Trento, an area that accounts for 85% of Italian Pinot Grigio.
Working alongside Armani will be vice presidents Valerio Cescon (Veneto) and Goffredo Pasolli (Trentino), as well as members of the newly elected board.
“I accept the challenge; along with the new Board, we will continue developing a project begun two years ago that has already brought extraordinary results”, said Armani, adding: “We are well aware of the responsibility before us; this appellation holds enormous potential just waiting to be developed. Already the conversation around this great variety has a new and different tone. It is an asset that we must defend and maximize, establishing it with a strong identity firmly grounded in Italy and in the Triveneto in particular.”
With the installation of its first elected board, the Consorzio Vini delle Venezie DOC becomes fully operational.
Among the priorities for the newly elected board – in addition to the development of promotional activities and maximising the potential of the appellation – is the completion of the DOC approval process at the European level, and improvement of the control and management tools for production potential.
“Our intention is that the ‘delle Venezie’ concept, with the wine, typical products and culture imbued with tradition, offer the idea of a region and an appellation able to deliver quality and, at the same time, strong, authentic and long-lasting emotions,” concludes Armani.

Butterfly lovers Edition #vintage2008 select by @susanne.hou 🎻we care how you drink champagne… 🍾🥂 Butterflies 🦋 and music notes 🎶 appear when the champagne reach the right tasting temperature ❄️
A post shared by  Champagne Infinite Eight (@champagne.infinite.eight) on Mar 5, 2019 at 7:07am PST



Made in Ville-Dommange, near Reims, the Champagne, called Cuvée Butterfly Lovers, is made from the 2008 vintage and will be launched in Japan this month and France in April
In order to achieve the visual effects, the Champagne brand has worked with French food packaging firm Distripac. The bottles are covered with a plastic film which is coated with a thermo-reactive varnish which responds to cold temperatures. Once the bottle reaches around 8 to 10 degrees celsius, the pink music note and butterfly pattern is revealed.
To celebrate the launch, the brand has teamed up with Chinese Canadian violinist Yi-Jia Susanne Hou, who has released some music to accompany the release. Hou, a fan of wine and gastronomy, has collaborated with a number of restaurants and wineries in an effort to further understand how taste and sensory experiences are enhanced by sound and music. She has worked with Relais Chateau grand chef Jonathan Gushue of Langdon Hall in Cambridge, executive chef Tyler Shedden of Café Boulud in Four Seasons Toronto, and winemaker Kathy Malone of Hillside Winery in the Okanagan Valley.
This is not the first time that the brand has used this technology. The infinity symbol on its labels changes from grey to red when bottles of its Champagne reach the correct service temperature. Cuvée Butterfly Lovers is the first time that they’ve used the technology across the entire bottle.
Champagne Infinite Eight is run by winemaker Nicolas Le Tixerant and designer Frank Leroux. Le Tixerant’s grandfather was the co-owner of Champagne Edmond Roussin, while his father Philippe was the director of communications for the CIVC (Comité Interprofessionnel du vin de Champagne). According to the company website, Nicolas Le Tixerant planted his first vines 20 years ago.
Speaking to The Local, Le Tixerant said: “It’s a first. We are the only ones to do it in the Champagne region.

“It’s a marketing device. It’s also a fun way of learning when a bottle of champagne is ready to be drunk,” he added.

The judging panel of the award, which included Jancis Robinson MW, Susan McCraith MW and Master of the Vintners’ Company Rupert Clevely, unanimously selected Barnes as the winner for the £8,000 prize last month.
Barnes will direct the prize money toward researching emerging and historic wine regions in Latin America to publish a comprehensive guide on the region later this year.
“There is so much diversity here in South America and this guide aims to scratch beneath the surface of South American wine to show wine lovers a different side to Latin American wine,” said Barnes.
“I’m working with more than 40 local researchers and experts in order to create the most comprehensive guide to South American wine and put some of these emerging wine regions on the map for the first time, as well as bringing consumers up-to-date on what’s happening in the most historical regions.”
The South America Wine Guide is already available online with regular features and a comprehensive winery guide to Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, Bolivia and Peru.
“The judging panel were highly complimentary in their support for Amanda’s application,” added Glenn Roberts of the Vintners’ Company. “This is a very ambitious project and the Vintners’ Company wish her every success.”
The print edition of The South America Wine Guide is set to be published at the end of 2019 and copies can be pre-ordered online now.

Diageo has re-entered the cider market with the launch of Rockshore Apple Cider, in an effort to claw back a slice of the market from competitor C&C Group, which owns Bulmers.
Rockshore Apple Cider will launch first in the Republic of Ireland
Diageo launched its Rockshore Apple Cider on Thursday, representing the group’s third attempt to gain a foothold in the Irish cider market.
Diageo previously tried to enter the cider category in the late 1990s and early 2000s with Cashel’s and Hudson Blue, but neither brand gained any traction.
Rockshore Apple Cider follows Diageo’s launch last year of Rockshore Lager.
“Since the launch of Rockshore lager 12 months ago we have been overwhelmed by the response from both trade and consumers,” said head of marketing for beer and cider at Diageo, Stuart Kinch.
“We have been experimenting and trialling cider recipes for several years and we believe that we have landed on something refreshingly different.”
The 4% cider is described as “light, crisp and refreshing” but with a “less sweet taste than other cider”.
“What became clear during the development process is that people often find cider overly sweet, so we wanted to create a cider that offers a refreshing taste with a balanced sweetness,” added brewer Aisling Ryan. “Rockshore Apple Cider is made from the juice of freshly pressed apples. The apples are harvested, milled and pressed to extract the fresh apple juice which is then fermented within five days, producing a crisp, refreshing taste with a distinctive natural green apple character.”
The cider is being rolled out first in the Republic of Ireland, in the on-trade, supermarkets and in off-licences, and will be available in bottles, cans and on draught.

The new group consists of five Surrey-based wine producers which include Greyfriars Vineyard, based on the Hogs Back just outside Guildford; Chilworth Manor Vineyard, located on the Chilworth Manor estate which is recorded in the Domesday Book; Albury Vineyard, an organic producer located just outside Guilford; boutique winery High Clandon; and English wine stalwart, Denbies, which is based in Dorking.
To celebrate its official launch on 8 and 9 June, the group has planned activities across all five member vineyards, giving guests the chance to sample the different wines and explore a “secret vineyard trail” at Denbies.
Other activities include live music in the vineyards, an art and sculpture exhibition among the vines at High Clandon, and ‘the battle of Waterloo tasting’ where visitors can sample Surrey wines alongside Champagne.
The wine group has also created a map of the region, which also provides details of how to travel to the area from London or the surrounding counties. All producers are within a 20-mile radius of the capital.
Commenting on formation, Nick Wenman, owner of Albury Vineyard and chair of WineGB South East, said: “England is now internationally recognised as a leading producer of top quality wines. We are proud to be putting Surrey on the map as a premium wine region, offering some of the very best wines and visitor experiences that England has to share.”
Sibylla Tindale, co-owner of High Clandon added: “This initiative not only celebrates our outstanding wines but also the beauty of the five vineyards set within the Surrey Hills AONB. Each vineyard, from boutique to big, has unique offerings in multi-award winning English wines and tours. We want our visitors to delight in wandering through the vineyards, tasting the wines, to learn something new and to really immerse themselves here.”
Most recently, seven wine producers from Kent banded together to form the Wine Garden of England, a play on usual epithet for the county. The Kentish wine group operates in collaboration with tourism body Visit Kent and  provides a website where you can book vineyard tours, accommodation and transport at the same time.

Growing interest in ‘good-for-you, good-for-the-environment’ wines including organic and vegan wines, is creating an exciting opportunity for wine retailers to open up the category, according to Aldi buyer Mike James.
Speaking to the drinks business at last week’s tasting, James told db that the growth of organic, vegan, no sulphur-added, low alcohol wines and wines in different formats, meant that the customer “norm and the go-tos” were no longer the same, creating a great opportunity for retailers to explore.
“Whether its organic or vegan wines, suddenly everything is up for grabs,” he told db. “It is really exciting for a supermarket to be able to realise – there are some pockets that are relatively important from a volume growth point-of- view, if you get it right, you can tap into that and kind of own it.”
“On their own are quite small areas, but collectively you’re talking about a significant, and in very, very strong growth,” he noted.
New formats
New formats are also an exciting area, James said, and although Aldi is not currently intending to bring back the innovative craft beer styles wine bottles it launched in 2016, it is looking at expanding its range of different formats.
“There is a customer who’s willing to buy into wine that is not in the normal 75cl glass bottle or the style of wine that you or I might get, so it’s trying to tap into that,” he told db.
He said the discounter would be putting in a lot of different formats to “almost test the market” and get customers to tell them what works and what doesn’t.
“It’s very difficult especially when you have such a small bit of the market, to see what the direction of the market is, what the trends might be, so let’s just go and put lots of formats and see what works!” he said.
As well as ramping up its choice of half bottles and minis, Aldi is also looking at new bag-in-box and pouched formats, which have seen good growth.
“We’re seeing pretty good growth with our mainstay bag-in-box, but I think the future is about growing acceptance, we [the UK] is not quite there yet in the acceptance of high quality wine [in the format]. There’s acceptance of entry-level and mid-tier, but not more premium wine, although we are edging up,” he said.
“Whereas before we wouldn’t have dreamed of putting a premium wine in bag-in-box – and I am still a bit nervous doing that to the extent that it’s probably not the right thing to do – maybe that will come,” he said.
“Now it’s about how we start going up the ladder to that sort of thing.”
Online ambition
Aldi is also set to “stretch” its online wine range with more higher priced wines, James said, on the back of strong growth.
“It’s been really strong and continues to beat our forecasts and expectations,” he noted, adding that three years after launching the e-commerce platform, it was becoming a more mature avenue of sale.
“We’re now more and more confident we can stretch the range online because of that maturity we’ve got and because we also have more data,” he said.  “There’s a lot we’re doing and more to come to push it even further, and the time is right to start stretching it a bit.”
The discounter has launched an English still wine  for the first time along with a range of ‘exciting’ white and red Portuguese wines , which it said demonstrated the wider trend for crisp, crunchy, more acidic wines.

Our second Wine & Spirits Show is just over a month away, and now US producer E&J Gallo has announced it will showcase a selection of wines from its premium portfolio at the two day event.

the drinks business and The Spirits Business are joining forces to host the Wine & Spirits Show on 12 and 13 April 2019.
Now, Californian wine giant E&J Gallo has announced it will bring core range wines from its premium brands based in California, Washington, and New Zealand.
Among the labels slated to appear at the show are Marlborough winery Whitehaven, Californian brands Frei Brothers Sonoma Reserve and Edna Valley Vineyard, and Columbia Winery based in Washington. All wines are available from UK retailers such as Waitrose, Majestic and Oddbins, priced between £14.75 and £17.99
The announcement comes after the Californian company said its premium portfolio drove much of its sales growth in 2018.
E&J Gallo channel director, Mark Stammers said the trend for premium wine had been growing for a while, and over 20% of its still wine sales came from wines priced at £7 and over last year.
Speaking to the drinks business last year, Scott Kozel, vice president of winemaking, said that the company is gradually moving beyond big volume sub $10 wines to more premium, boutique labels.
“Previously we have acquired [wineries or brands, or vineyards] and said it’s just part of Gallo,” he said. “Over the years we have learned that we want the brand and the winery to have a personality of its own, and for each team to make their own decisions.”
Some 1,500 visitors are expected to descend on Westminster this spring, sampling everything from German craft gin to Pol Roger Champagne.
We’re also bringing back the G&T bar this year, featuring spirits from Hamburg-based distillery Knut Hansen, Pocketful of Stones – headquartered in Long Rock, near Penzance, and Scotland’s Orkney Gin Company.
Members of the trade will be welcome from 2-5pm on Friday. To register for the trade session, follow this link. 
The event will open to consumers from 2pm until 9pm on Friday, and 1pm until 8pm on Saturday.

Bestway, the independent cash and carry and wholesaler that snapped up Conviviality’s retail businesses out of administration last year, has appointed an interim trading director to oversee product buying across its booze retail, in the latest in a series of internal moves.

Former Scotmid commercial director Mark Owen has joined the retail business as interim trading director at Bestway Retail to oversee the product ranges across the Bargain Booze and Wine Rack franchises, corporate stores and Select and Central Convenience corporate stores.
Owen, who spent 13 years at The Co-operative Group, most recently as head of commercial & sales development before joining Scotmid, will report to chief retail officer, Andy Cresswell.
Owen is taking over from Kenton Burchell, who has been promoted to trading director at Bestway Wholesale, following Dawood Pervez’s promotion to md of Bestway Wholesale and Retail last December.
Burchell joined Conviviality Retail in 2014 from Musgrave, taking charge of the drinks offer for Bargain Booze and Wine Rack as well as the convenience offer for Select Convenience. He moved to Bestway following the company’s acquisition of the Conviviality business in April 2018 for £7.25 million.
It is the latest in a series of management changes in the group.
In November, Bestway retail md David Robinson, who was Conviviality Retail’s managing director during its acquisition by Bestway, left the company and Cresswell, managing director of retail of MRH, the UK’s largest service station operator, was confirmed as the new head of retail in January. At the same time Tony Holmes was appointed to the new role of retail director at Bestway Wholesale, to oversee retail sales for the best-one Symbol Group, as well as taking responsibility for retail business development.
The Bestway Group was founded in 1976 and today comprises Bestway Wholesale, symbol group Best-one, which operates the franchises of over 1,113 convenience stores, Bestway Foodservice, and two businesses in Pakistan, United Bank Limited, the second largest private bank in Pakistan and the country’s largest cement producer Bestway Cement. It also operates Wells Pharmacy, the third largest pharmacy business in the UK.

Dr Laura Catena
Each episode has been produced in collaboration with New York-based Wine Enthusiast Media, and is available on Amazon Prime Video. 
Commenting on the release, Jay Spaleta, executive producer and Wine Enthusiast senior vice president, said: “We felt that the best way to convey these stories was in episodic fashion.

“It Starts With Wine is a docuseries that tells a personal story and shares deep insights in a way that is very approachable, engaging and revealing.”
The first episode of the series features chef Francis Mallmann, who recently released his own wine range made from grapes grown at his vineyard in Mendoza’s Uco Valley. He is joined by Italian winemaker and consultant Alberto Antonini as they talk about the culture, cuisine and terroir of Uruguay and the wines of Bodega Garzón, one of Antonini’s clients.
Episode two heads to Argentina to highlight the story of Catena Zapata itself, featuring and in-depth conversation with Harvard & Stanford educated physician, Dr. Laura Catena, who currently runs her family’s winery and is largely credited for the renaissance of Malbec in Mendoza.
She is joined by chef Deborah de Corral, a Latin Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter, TV personality and Miami restauranteur, and together they take a journey into the heart and soul of Argentine wine and food culture, opening up about their lives, unique experiences and what drives them to achieve greatness in their fields.

Singapore’s French fine dining restaurant Odette has usurped Bangkok-based restaurant Gaggan to become the best restaurant in Asia, named by Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, a title that Gaggan had held for four consecutive years.
Led by chef Julien Royer, Odette is the first Singapore restaurant to take the top spot in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants List.
Housed in the National Gallery Singapore, Odette serves Asian-inspired modern French cuisine. Taking its name from Royer’s maternal grandmother, Odette earned Asia’s Highest New Entry Award in 2017 before debuting on the World’s 50 Best Restaurants List at No. 28.
Gaggan, the progressive Indian restaurant, moved to No.2 while retaining the title of The Best Restaurant in Thailand.
The 2019 list features 10 new restaurants, including two first-time entries from Hong Kong: Vea (No.34) and Seventh Son (No.44). Hong Kong counts nine restaurants on the list, including The Chairman (rising from No.22 to No.11), 81⁄2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana (No.12), Amber (No.21), Neighborhood (No.37), Lung King Heen (No.38) and Ta Vie (No.50). Soaring 25 places to No.15, modern French bistro Belon is crowned with this year’s ‘Highest Climber Award’.
Host destination Macau counts two restaurants with Jade Dragon rising eight places to No.27 and Wing Lei Palace debuting at No.36. 
The 2019 list reflects the diversity and vitality of the ever-evolving Asian gastronomic scene, including a first-time entry from Malaysia (Dewakan, No.46) and a new restaurant in the Philippines (Toyo Eatery, No.43), a country last represented in the list in 2017. 
William Drew, group editor of Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, said: “Now in its seventh year, the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list continues to evolve, inspire and showcase emerging talent. The 2019 list welcomes 10 new restaurants, including a first-time entry from Malaysia, and celebrates the ongoing culinary innovation in the region.”
Japan leads the 2019 list with 12 entries. Fronting this group is Den (No.3). Its chef, Zaiyu Hasegawa, was also rewarded for his innovative approach and named the 2019 recipient of the Chefs’ Choice Award, the only award voted for by the chefs of the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants. 
The results were announced on 26 March at Wynn Palace in Macau.

Dutchweek | Zell Am See – Kaprun | 23-26 Januari 2019 | © MarcVerhees Fotografie
The vodka brand, co-founded by Maarten Witteveen, is made using 100% natural cannabis terpenes to flavour the vodka, and as such contains none of the psychoactive or medicinal properties of the marijuana plant.
“We started as most ideas flourish I guess, shooting the shit with some mates and coming up with the crazy idea of adding cannabis leaves to vodka, a bit like the botanical distillation of gins without the master distiller involved,” explains Witteveen.
“In the end we figured we would use 100% natural cannabis terpenes (flavour). Most cannabis terpenes are artificial as there is very little oil in the plant to extract. We considered the options and 100% natural is by far the best performer infused in top quality, quintuple distilled French grain vodka at 40% ABV.”
The cannabis oil used to flavour the spirit is sourced from California, where the team is able to work with cannabis legally, however tests are then carried out independently to ensure that there is no THC (the psychoactive substance in cannabis) present, making it legal in European markets.
As a result Weedka is 100% legal wherever alcohol is legal, adds Witteveen.
Weedka is produced in the Netherlands, with the first batch produced in December, and is now available in both the Netherlands and Germany, with plans to extend its reach to markets including the UK, Belgium, Austria, Spain, Georgia, Lebanon, Central/South America and the Caribbean in the near future.
Next month, the brand will be showcased at the Wine & Spirits Show in London, hosted by the drinks business and The Spirits Business, which will return to the Royal Horseguards Hotel at One Whitehall Place on 12 and 13 April 2019.
“There is a road to travel for Weedka as we are innovating within a pretty calm vodka category,” said Witteveen. “We are not another flavoured vodka, we are engaging deeply in infusing botanicals into an organic spirit experience. From a flavour perspective we have received various comments that we are closer to a botanical craft gin then we are to pure vodka. The fun part is that Weedka can most certainly be enjoyed neat, we would argue more so than gin can be. In a way we transcend both categories, the purity and clarity of great vodka married to the botanical flavour profile of gin.”
The Wine & Spirits Show
Alongside individual exhibitors, visitors will also be able to enjoy New Products Zone, a masterclass series and a G&T bar, as well as the launch of a new zone dedicated to the most-awarded wines from our annual Global Masters competitions.

A new phylloxera outbreak has been detected in Victoria, following a prior outbreak earlier this month, prompting Agriculture Victoria to extend its Maroondah Phylloxera Infested Zone (PIZ) further.
The second outbreak of phylloxera this month has been detected at Coldstream, inside the existing Maroondah Phylloxera Infested Zone (PIZ) in the Yarra Valley, Victoria.
On 1 March, an outbreak was detected within a commercial vineyard in St Andrews in the Yarra Valley, Victoria, within a then designated Phylloxera Risk Zone (PRZ).
At the time Vinehealth Australia CEO, Inca Pearce called this latest phylloxera outbreak in Victoria a “concerning development”, which highlights the “critical role that industry must play in preventing further spread”.
A further industry notice was posted on 25 March, less than a month later, advising of a second outbreak detected at Coldstream, inside the existing Maroondah Phylloxera Infested Zone (PIZ) in the Yarra Valley, Victoria.
The strain of phylloxera detected has been confirmed as G1; the same as that found in the Maroondah PIZ and at St Andrews.
In response to the recent detections at both St Andrews and Coldstream, two extensions to the current Maroondah PIZ boundary have resulted.
The process of formally declaring the new Maroondah PIZ is underway. In the interim, these two new extension areas to the Maroondah PIZ are considered phylloxera infested zones for the movement of regulated products.
Phylloxera is an insect pest that can have a devastating impact on grapevines, affecting Vitis species. There are currently 83 endemic strains in Australia that are confined to a number of wine regions in parts of Victoria and New South Wales, representing a “major threat” to the vast majority of Australia’s vineyards that are planted on own roots, which are highly susceptible to attack by the pest.
Agriculture Victoria is urging winemakers in the region to remain vigilant and to ensure preventative measures are in place to prevent the movement of pests, diseases and weeds, including phylloxera, as part of their shared responsibility for biosecurity.
This includes implementing strict farm gate hygiene practices to prevent the entry of phylloxera or other pests, diseases and weeds into your vineyard, as well as recording the wine regions where all visitors to your site (including their machinery/equipment) have been in the past three weeks, so that you can assess the risk they pose to your vines by determining whether they have been in a PIZ or PRZ.

Australian grapegrowing regions are delineated by phylloxera status into three management zones:

Phylloxera Exclusion Zones (PEZ) have been surveyed and found free or are declared free historically.
Phylloxera Risk Zones (PRZ) are of unknown status.
Phylloxera Infested Zones (PIZ) contain vineyards known to be or have been infested.

English sparkling wine Coates & Seely has announced it is the new sponsor of The Jockey Club, which will see its wines poured at 14 of the club’s 15 racecourses.
The three year partnership was announced on 28 March and gives the home-grown fizz the pouring rights at 14 major British racecourses such as Aintree, Epsom and Newmarket which hold some of the biggest events in the British racing calendar.
As well as the punters themselves, Coates & Seely will also be offered to all winning owners and trainers after the races too.
At each race meet Coates & Seely will have an official presence as well in the shape of a classic 1952 British Leyland coach, liveried in green and off-white, and from which its wines can be sold to racegoers.
The bus, named ‘Albion’, was discovered by Nicholas Coates a mere three weeks ago in a barn near Brussels looking, “terribly forlorn”.
He recounted though that he had instantly “fallen in love” and all of his family had quickly become aware that there was “another woman in my life”.
He described Albion as looking like, “an aged diva or dowager,” that just needed some “Care and attention and her hair done”, which was accomplished in record time to allow a maiden cruise around Belgravia and Saint James’s in London on 28 March. Her first race appointment will be at Newmarket in April.

Commenting on the new partnership, Coates and Christian Seely, co-founders of Coates & Seely said: “We are delighted to have been appointed an official partner by the Jockey Club, which is a major accolade for our young brand. There are many qualities that connect fine wine with racing – not least the endless pursuit of form and quality and a love of celebration – and we greatly look forward to developing our activities across this wonderful portfolio of racecourses.”
Paul Fisher, chief executive of Jockey Club Racecourses, said: “It’s great to be working with Coates & Seely and we’re really looking forward to a prosperous partnership over the next three years. We look to support British producers on our menus and wine lists wherever we can and I’m sure our racegoers will be impressed with this sparkling wine. I know I am!”

The Langham Hotel in London, which comprises restaurants Roux at the Landau and the Wigmore pub, is to launch a new cookery school that will be fronted by top chefs including Michel Roux Jr and Chris King, and which promises to reveal “trade secrets” to its students.
(L-R) Chris King, Millie Simpson, Quentin Plateaux and Michel Roux Jr
Called Sauce by The Langham, the school will offer a range of classes from core skills such as knife skills, baking and sauce making to more complex techniques and masterclasses.
The school and its facilities will be located at the Portland Place hotel, and will teach groups of up to 12 at a time with standard sessions starting at £150, and premium classes from £250.
“We’re going to have a perfect environment to share our passion for good food with like-minded home cooks at whatever their skill level,” said Roux. “Cooking should be first and foremost enjoyable, and we’re looking forward to providing a real confidence boost so that everyone can be proud of what they achieve.”
The hotel’s executive pastry chef Andrew Gravett will lead pâtisserie courses, while students will also be offered the chance to explore the Roux archive through masterclasses with Michel Roux and hotel classics with Chris King.
The majority of classes will be overseen by kitchen manager Millie Simpson, who’ll be helped by the hotel’s senior sous chef, Quentin Plateaux.
“We have some of the most innovative and dynamic minds here within The Langham’s restaurants and bars, which makes our jobs engaging and exciting,” said The Langham managing director Bob van den Oord.
“We wanted to find a way to celebrate the talent of the team and Sauce by The Langham is a natural evolution of this idea – a place where we can share our trade secrets.”
Chris King added: “Sauce is a great opportunity for our brigade to share their passion for good food and show their love for our industry. I’m fortunate at The Langham, London to work with some very talented and energetic chefs who have so much to teach; every class will be packed full of learning, with a pinch fun.”
Sauce by The Langham will launch in May 2019. For more information, visit saucebylangham.com

Oxfordshire brewery Hook Norton and the Cotswolds Distillery have teamed up with The Open University on a new online course focusing on the science of alcohol.

The online course is free and available to everyone, and consists of 24 hours of study time spread across eight weeks. Participants can sign up for free downloadable badges for proof of course completion.
The course starts by discussing how alcohol is produced and how different drinks are manufactured and analysed. It will also look into the history for alcohol production and will allow participants the chance to make their own drinks with an optional home-brew experiment.
It will then go on to introduce the brewing process before discussing brewing on an industrial scale. It will also discuss taste and aroma perception, the short-term and long-term effects of alcohol, the distillation process and spirits. Finally it will explore product protection and maintaining product provenance, highlighting the technology used to stop counterfeiting and contamination.
The course will also involve weekly interactive quizzes which in week four and week eight, will allow students to earn a badge to demonstrate their achievement.
The university filmed a series of short films for the course at Hook Norton Brewery in June last year with the aid of Chaos Films.
Dr Louise MacBrayne, staff tutor in life, health and chemical sciences and author of the course, said: “Hook Norton made a really valuable contribution, without their input, the course would not have turned out the way it did. They have made it really engaging and allowed us to show the practical application of science. It means course learners can see the perspective of the actual brewery and gain expert opinions and a level of expertise we simply would not have had without them.”

Alongside Dr MacBrayne, two other academics feature in the course: Dr Daniel Allwood, an organic chemist and keen homebrewer, from Sheffield Hallam University, and Dr Paul Kosmetatos, lecturer in economic history at the University of Edinburgh.
As well as Hook Norton, the videos were also filmed at the Cotswolds Distillery, while the course was also supported by The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA). The course was developed with assistance from Dr Nick Turner, senior lecturer in bioanalytical chemistry in The School of Pharmacy at De Montfort University and visiting fellow at The Open University.

William Grant and Sons-owned gin brand Hendrick’s is installing phone boxes full of flowers, gin and mirrors to celebrate the launch of its Midsummer Solstice Gin.
The brand is erecting the pop-up phone boxes in five locations around the UK, offering free samples to passers by.
The phone boxes which will be “obliterated by flowers” are promoting the launch of the brand’s new gin, created by master distiller Lesley Gracie.
The limited-edition, 43.4% ABV gin is the first expression to launch from Gracie’s “Cabinet of Curiosities”, which is said to be “a place of experimental botanic alchemy” at the Hendrick’s Gin Palace in Scotland. 
Said to be made in the brand’s house-style, the gin is then infused with floral essences and flavours that capture the “aromatic intensity of a midsummer day”.
Guests will be rewarded with a sample of the gin, plus a further drink made with the new expression and a flower to take away with them.
The phone boxes will be installed today in London’s Soho Square between 12pm and 9pm, Brighton Palace Pier between 12pm and 7pm and Edinburgh’s Castle Street between 12pm and 7pm.
They’ll also be on show on Saturday in Edinburgh and Liverpool Salthouse Dock between 12pm and 7pm.
On Sunday, the phone boxes will be in Liverpool again and in Manchester’s King Street between 12pm and 7pm, also occupying the street on Monday 1 April.
Commenting on the launch last month, Gracie said: “I have always been enamoured by the power of nature’s flavours and aromas at the peak of summer and for this new expression I’ve hand-selected each floral essence to capture this intensity.
“Midsummer Solstice joins a long line of innovations from Hendrick’s and I’m excited to not only create new expressions at the Gin Palace, but also share them with curious tasters and gin explorers all over the world.”

Health officials in France have told the nation that it should be drinking no more than two glasses of wine a day, and not everyday, to reduce the risk of alcohol-related diseases.

According to Santé Publique France, almost a quarter of French adults are regularly drinking too much alcohol, and this level of drinking is killing 41,000 people a year, making it the second biggest cause of avoidable deaths in the country after smoking.
“It’s about 10.5 million adults who drink too much. In any case they drink in proportions that increase the risks to their health, including cancers, high blood pressure, cerebral haemorrhage and cardiovascular diseases,” said Viet Nguyen-Thanh, head of Santé Publique France.
In its official guidance, Santé Publique France is advising people to drink no more than 10 glasses of wine each week, with that being the equivalent of 100ml a glass, totalling 1,000ml of wine a week. 
This is slightly less than the recommended amount advised in the UK, which currently stands at 14 units per week, or seven 175ml glasses of wine – 1,225ml.
“For your health, alcohol should be limited to a maximum of two glasses per day, and not every day either,” a new campaign from the national public health agency, Santé Publique France, states.
However World Health Organization (WHO) figures show that the French are far from being the heaviest drinkers in Europe. They have an average annual consumption per person of 12.6 litres of pure alcohol, behind Lithuania’s 15 litres, Germany’s 13.4 litres, Ireland and Luxembourg’s 13 litres each and Latvia’s 12.9 litres. In the UK 11.5 litres are drunk per person annually.
Generally, consumption of wine in France has been dropping, along with the rest of the world. According to a 2017 report by the IWSR, the rate of decline in global alcohol consumption is accelerating, with the global market for alcoholic drinks shrinking by 1.3% in 2016, compared with an average rate of 0.3% in the previous five years.
By category, consumption of still wine dropped by 0.5% in 2016, according to the IWSR, while the sparkling wine market grew 1.8%, driven by Prosecco.
Despite overall decline of global alcohol consumption, the IWSR predicted that this trend will reverse in the next five years, forecasting consumption to rise by 0.8% until 2021, largely driven by whisky, which the IWSR predicted will grow in volume to 650m litres by 2021.
As reported by The Guardian, Jérôme Villaret, general delegate of Languedoc AC winemakers, said: “This kind of publicity campaign upsets the moderate consumer,” he told La Depeche newspaper. “To us, these kinds of studies just make consumers feel guilty.”
The announcement is part of a new nationwide information campaign about the dangers of alcohol, which will run until April 12.

London cocktail bar Callooh Callay is launching a new cocktail menu in April that will take its aesthetic inspiration from the famous Haynes car manuals of the 1980s.
Following on from its 10th anniversary celebrations last year, the new menu “reimagines” the much-loved manuals for a cocktail bar with 26 creations nine sections including ‘The Plan’, ‘The Location’, ‘The Team’ and ‘Keeping a Clear Head’ (an alcohol-free selection).
Each section then features cocktails relevant to each along with how the drink is put together and the story behind it and there is an index of ingredients to help drinkers go straight to a cocktail that matches their tastes.
Callooh Callay Founder Richard Wynne said: “We’ve created some really fun and interactive menus over the years, and I’m hugely grateful to all the work the team who have put in a massive effort to make the Haynes manual-inspired creative a reality. They were huge when I was a kid, and I love anything with a bit of nostalgic retro value.
“We’ve really dug deep into our experiences over the last 10 years to bring it together, starting with the seed money my grandma generously gave me to start the venture, so the finished menu is one of the most personal to me.
“I strongly believe that the most important aspect of any bar is the team, and I’m proud to say that our new menu includes at least one drink from every one of our current bar team. The result is a wonderfully varied offering reflecting their individual backgrounds and tastes – from kombucha to sherbert – and a top-notch selection of non-alcoholic cocktails too. We’re now excited to see what our customers think about the Haynes-inspired menu, and introducing an awesome line-up of new drinks at Callooh Callay.”
The new menu will be launched on 10 April.

Rothschild Waddesdon Limited (RWL) has revamped the wine shop at Waddesdon Manor to hold the largest collection of wines from the Domaines Barons de Rothschild portfolio, and will offer customers samples of its rare and fine wines, including First Growths, via Coravin.
Waddesdon will display its full range of Rothschild Grand Crus in the new wine shop
The new wine shop at the Rothschild chateau in Buckinghamshire, which is now part of the National Trust, will stock 126 Rothschild wines with prices ranging from £7.50 to nearly £26,000, and replaces the previous shop that was tucked way in the Old Billiard Room in the house. The aim is to make the collection “more accessible” to customers by offering complementary daily wine tastings as well as 50ml pours of fine wines through the Coravin system, according to Sara Sweetland, managing director of Rothschild Waddesdon Limited (the trading company that is part of the Rothschild Foundation, and whose profits supports Waddesdon Manor).
‘We hope this interactive approach will help make our wines more accessible, so customers leave with a bottle that is suited to their palate,” she said. “We’re also excited to allow customers the chance to taste legendary wines without the pressure of committing to a bottle, by trying a 50ml pour during their visit.”
Rothschild wine expert Peter Tompkins told db it was a bold move to extend the shop in the current climate, but one that capitalise on the growth RWL had seen in wine sales, as well as underlining the history between the house, the Rothschild family and the wines.
“We’ve had consecutive growth in retail in wine for the last five years so we thought it was a good move to capitalise on that. Obviously it’s a bold move given the climate but we thought we’d go for it,” he told db.
“We’ve researched throughout last year shops that offer Enomatic or Coravin pours – many of which are in central London which is very different to rural Buckinghamshire with a venue that has a pay barrier. We’re starting with four wines that sum up the portfolio, explain its breadth geographically and also make the prices affordable, but we will be putting the first growths on by the glass as well.”
A flight of four wines, that will be changed on a regular basis will be available via Coravin, with the first wines including Aile d’Argent 2015, a rare blend of Semillon and Sauvignon from Chateau Mouton produced by Baron Phillipe de Rothschild (£11.50 per 50ml taster), Lafite’s Argentinian Malbec Cabernet blend Caro 2015, which is produced in tiny quantities (£5.95 for 50ml), a single vineyard Chilean blend from Lafite, Los Vascos Le Dix 2015 (£5.95 for 50ml), and a the “legendary” 1990 Bordeaux, Chateau Duhart Milon 1990 (£16.95 for 50ml).
A custom-built cooling unit in the shop will showcase the full range of Grand Cru wines – which range in price from £120 to £25,995 a bottle – so they are fully visible to the shop’s customers.
Highlights in the list include Château Mouton 1982, Château Lafite 1961, and Château L’Evangile 1982 but there will also be 50 ‘guest’ wines from classic regions such as Burgundy and the Loire, as well as “individual wines with character”, Tompkin said, including twenty that aren’t available elsewhere in the UK.
The shop will also stock a selection of more modestly priced bottles, starting at £7.50, with a total of 27 wines retailing under £12, as well as a range of gins, ales and beers made using botanicals and fruit gathered on the estate.
Tomkin said that working directly with the cellars of the respective Rothschild estates guaranteed ‘cellar-to-cellar’ provenance, ensuring the wines have been stored “immaculately” have not travelled unnecessarily, and have been looked after correctly in transit. This ability to account for the condition and provenance of each bottle was exceptionally rare, he said, as the prestige and global appeal of the Rothschild portfolio meant it was under constant threat of fraudulent reproduction.
“The 1961 Château Lafite remains among the most frequently replicated wines on the planet, yet Waddesdon stocks three bottles that have spent nearly all their life resting in a dark corner in the cellars of Château Lafite, slowly evolving in optimum conditions before being transported directly to Waddesdon’s own cellars,” he said.
“It’s mainly the condition of these wines that our clients are interested in – you could buy them for less on the open market but a lot of our clients want to ensure absolutely pristine provenance and authenticity of the wine, so if we can offer them a three-pack of ’78 Lafite that comes with Lafite strapping, that’s been re-corked and has QR codes, that in itself holds rarity.”
Rothschild Waddesdon Limited (RWL) is part of the Rothschild Foundation which looks after the trading at Waddesdon Manor, including the hotel, the dairy wedding venue, the Manor restaurant, the Wine Shop, Gift Shop, Stable Café and Courtyard and food to go outlets. It works closely with Waddesdon Wine, the main trade representative for the the three branches of the Rothschild  family in the UK, which looks after the wholesale and trade operation.

The beer, called “When There Are Nine,” is a Belgian Bruit IPA and is named after her famous response to the question “When will there be enough women on the Supreme Court?”
“We wanted to name it Brut Bader Ginsburg,” read a statement on Eventbrite, “but our legal team, uh, dissented.”
The new brew forms part of a fundraising initiative for the Pink Boots Society, which supports women in the US’ beer industry.
When There Are Nine was brewed by the Pink Boots Society in collaboration with US hop supplier Yamika Chief on International Women’s Day (8 March), and will be released at an event at Samuel Adams’ Boston tap-room at a special launch event.
The brewer will donate $5 from every ticket and $1 from every When There Are Nine sold to the Pink Boots Society.
Ginsburg is one of few politicians to get a beer named after her in good faith. In 2017 Six female brewers in Denver, Colorado, created a beer to protest Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 45th President of the United States.
In fact, Trump has often been the subject of beer-based protests. Later that year, Brewdog partnered with environmental charity 10:10 Climate Action to “raise awareness and spark debate” on global warming, principally Trump’s lukewarm attitude to climate change research, and launched a beer called Make Earth Great Again.
The saison — which is fermented at a higher temperature than other beer styles — contains ingredients sourced from areas most impacted by global warming, including water from the Arctic ice caps, and Arctic cloudberries.

We need to talk about Majestic.

On Monday, the retailer rannounced it will close stores and rebrand as Naked Wine as it concentrates on its online business, despite CEO Gormley insisting the recently transformed Majestic business had “the potential to be a long-term winner”.
Many analysts were surprised by the unforeseen change in tack in the company’s strategy. Equity Research Analyst at Liberum Wayne Brown said there was no doubt retail was challenging on the high street, but questioned why the group would completely reshape the business, when only three and a half years ago, it thought it was an excellent idea to put these two businesses together.
“Why was it a good idea then and why is it a bad idea today?” he asked.

UK specialist retailer Majestic Wine has announced it will close stores and rebrand as Naked Wine as it concentrates on its online business, despite CEO Gormley insisting the recently transformed Majestic business had “the potential to be a long-term winner”.
The new CEO of Majestic Wine, in their Mayfair store. London, UK 09 Apr 2015.
In a statement this morning, the company announced it would refocus the business on the “significant growth opportunities in Naked Wines”, by releasing capital from its Majestic Retail and Commercial operations through the sale of some of its 200 stores as well as unspecified assets.
Currently, the company is made up of four arms Majestic Retail, Naked Wines, Majestic Commercial and fine wine specialist Lay & Wheeler but the company confirmed that the new Naked Wines group will operate as one group with one management team and ‘one focus’ – accelerating the growth of Naked Wines.
More details of the number of store closures and job losses will be unveiled in June, along with the company’s full-year results.
The surprise announcement marks a major departure from its previous business plan, which invested heavily in revamping the Majestic store estate and enabling its store managers to spend more time with customers – although the announcement claims this is the “next phase in its evolution”.
Group chief executive Rowan Gormley today said the company’s plans to focus all its capital and energy into Naked Wines and releasing value from Majestic were “well-advanced”. 
“It is clear that Naked Wines has the potential for strong sustainable growth, and we will deliver the best results for our shareholders, customers, people and suppliers by focusing all our energies on delivering that potential.”
“We also believe that a transformed Majestic business does have the potential to be a long-term winner, but that we risk not maximising the potential of Naked if we try to do both.”
“Where we have no choice but to close stores we will aim to minimise job losses by migration into Naked.” 
Transformation
As part of the new business plan, stores that are retained will be renamed Naked Wine, with spend being ramped up on new customers, including the launch of a new ‘face-to-face recruitment channel”, while existing Majestic customers will be “migrated to the Naked brand”.
Half the group’s business (45%) is now online, it said, with international sales contributing around 20% of the total, with further significant growth potential, particularly in the US.  Meanwhile Naked Wine has more than doubled in size since it was acquired by Majestic in April 2015, with a portfolio of 200 winemakers, and sales expected to exceed £175m this year.
This brings total sales since acquisition to nearly £600m, it said, with repeat customers contributing around £40m a year, enabling it to invest around £20m in the growing the customer base further. This will rise to £26 million in the next financial year.
Sales for the group are expected to hit its £500m target in the 2019 financial year, it said, with restructuring charges of up to £10m, and potentially substantial cash restructuring charges from FY20 onwards.

Winemaker and owner of Domaine Jones in the south of France, Katie Jones, praises London’s St John restaurant for the Languedoc-Roussillon focus on its wine list an reveals how she likes to pop into Cut at 45 Park Lane for a glass of Champagne.
1. What is your favourite restaurant in London?  
It has to be St John’s – amazing food and convivial atmosphere. I love what Fergus and team have done there. They have a great French wine list with a real focus on the Languedoc-Roussillon.
2. Where is your favourite wine offering in London and what’s your typical go-to first glass when you get there?
I love places like The Sampler and Vagabond wines where you have the opportunity to try many different wines in one go – we just don’t have these places in my remote village of Tuchan high up in the mountains on the Languedoc-Roussillon borders.
The first glass of wine would definitely be a glass of sparkling! St John’s list has a wonderful sparkling Limoux by the glass, but if I have time and really want to treat myself, I’ll pop into Cut at 45 Park Lane for a glass of Champagne. Decadent but a special treat!
3. How does London compare to other big global cities in terms of the wine lists you find there?
Mark-ups are generally much larger in London and it’s easy to see why with huge rents and massive operating costs. But increasingly there are more places applying lower margins to encourage their customers to experiment more and trade up. London wine lists offer much variety…more than so many European countries.
That said they are increasingly offering smaller more focused wine lists that change frequently – keeping it fresh and interesting but less daunting for customers. I also note an increased choice of by-the-glass wines, although this is a trend in European countries too. Sommeliers in London are so well informed, knowledgeable and enthusiastic. There are lots of exciting wine developments happening in other European cities I visit – but I do think London is still ahead of the game.

Chef Alyn Williams has stepped down from his position as chef patron at gastro pub The Wild Rabbit in Kingham in Oxfordshire to focus on his restaurant in Mayfair.
Serving modern European cuisine, the chef opened Alyn Williams at The Westbury in 2011. His debut solo venture, the restaurant was awarded a Michelin star the following year, followed by four AA Rosettes.
Williams arrived at The Westbury following his five-year tenure as head chef at Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley, accepting his residency at The Wild Rabbit in 2018 with the intention of dividing his time between the Cotswold-based gastropub and The Westbury.
Williams grew up in east London, where his father grew vegetables in two allotments and his back garden. Meat-free dishes remain a feature of his London restaurant in the Westbury hotel. 
Williams said: “I’m delighted to be back at The Westbury in London full-time. I had a brilliant time with the team at The Wild Rabbit and we’ve ended on extremely amicable terms, but London is where my heart really lies.
“I’ve got an exceptionally talented kitchen brigade at The Westbury and I’m hugely excited for this new chapter.”

The life of Gerard Basset OBE, MS, MW, MBA, MSc (OIV) will be celebrated at a service of thanksgiving in Winchester in June, with all members of the wine trade invited to attend.
Basset passed away on 16 January following a brave battle against cancer of the oesophagus.
Gerard’s wife Nina and son Romané confirmed details of a memorial service yesterday, which will be held at Winchester Cathedral on Friday, 14 June, at 11am. 
Following the service, a reception will be held at The Guildhall, Winchester.
The family has close personal ties to the city of Winchester, not least because it is home to the original Hotel du Vin, which Basset co-founded in 1994.
Members of the wine and hospitality industries are invited to attend the service and reception.
However it would be appreciated if those wishing to attend email inmemoriam@culturalcomms.co.uk by 30 May to give an indication of numbers.
Born in 1957, Basset arrived in the UK from France in the 1980s, having originally trained as a chef, but quickly discovered a taste for wine and switched his focus to becoming a sommelier.
Basset’s career really took flight in 1988, when he became head sommelier at the Michelin-starred Chewton Glen in the New Forest, Hampshire.

He earned his Master Sommelier qualification in 1989 and became an MW in 1998.
In 2007, Basset opened the renowned wine-focused TerraVina, a boutique luxury hotel in the heart of the New Forest, in Hampshire, with his wife, Nina.
Last year the couple scaled the business back to a bed and breakfast (Spot in the Woods), as Basset’s health deteriorated.
In 2010, he won the World Sommelier Championship, which was followed by an OBE in the 2011 Queen’s Birthday Honours for services to hospitality.
While undergoing treatment, Basset wrote his memoirs, which will be published in due course.

Somerby Vineyard and Winery in Lincolnshire, set in around 12.5 acres, has gone on the market for £800,000, producing on average 26,000 bottles of wine per year with the potential to expand the site.

Somerby, which is planted with 9,000 vines and includes an established winery, capable of vinifying 20,000 litres, is being marketed by Savills.
The vineyard is currently planted with Pinot Noir, Solaris and Rondo vines and has the potential to be planted with a further 3,000 vines. It currently supplies bottles to local Waitrose stores and has picked up awards at both the UKVA and IWC competitions.
The site has also recently started production of a cider and has plans to produce sparkling wine. The vines are on average 10 years old and achieved two tonnes per acre in 2018.
The winery is contained within two modern, steel portal framed buildings with a lean-to store in between. It has the capacity to vinify 20,000 litres but has room to to expand to around 150,000 litres.
There is the potential to rent a further 2.5 acres (1 hectare) of additional land planted with 1,500 vines, subject to negotiations.
Bob Hobson, owner of Somerby, has decided to move on after taking on the site 12 years ago. Commenting on the move, he said: “Having enjoyed 12 years building an award winning vineyard I have decided that the time has come to retire and pass the baton to the next generation of English winemakers, who I hope will get as much enjoyment out of it as I have.”
Having been assessed in the Soil Survey of England and Wales, the site is made up of Grade 3 soils described as shallow and well-drained silty over chalk.
Sam Thomas, farm agent at Savills Lincoln, commented: “Located on the northern edge of the north Lincolnshire Wolds, Somerby is an award winning English winery thanks largely to its chalk terrain which is most prominent in Kent and certainly a rarity further north. Its position offers far reaching, unspoilt views across the Lincolnshire Wolds with the landmark Lincoln Cathedral visible on a clear day.
“There is further potential to adapt or extend for further storage or to create a facility that can host a wine tourism business with the addition of a kitchen and tasting facilities, subject to gaining the necessary planning consents.”
To view the full details, please click here, or to arrange a viewing, please call Sam Thomas at Savills Lincoln on 01522 507 315 or email sthomas@savills.com.
The area under vine in Great Britain has increased by 160% in the past 10 years to reach 7,000 acres (2,888ha). In 2018, 1.6 million vines were planted with a further 2 million expected in 2019. Last year was a record year for the industry, with a total of 15.6 million bottles produced, beating the previous record (6.3 million bottles in 2014) by 9.3 million bottles.

Living in close proximity to a craft brewery could help push up the asking price of your property, according to a study by researchers at the University of Toledo and North Carolina.
Condominiums in centre-city neighbourhoods recorded a near 3% increase on sales price after a brewery opened within a half mile, while single family homes in centre-city neighbourhoods saw a near 10% increase.
Using Charlotte, North Carolina, as a case study, researchers found that craft breweries have a positive impact on residential property values.
For the study, researchers focused on properties sold between 2002 and 2017 within a half mile buffer of a brewery, with 21 breweries opened in Charlotte between March 2009 and October 2016.
The team found that while many areas in close proximity to a craft brewery appear to have been associated with relatively higher price premiums even before the opening of the brewery, breweries tend to add to this premium.
“These results are informative to policymakers considering revising zoning laws and other regulations in efforts to promote the growth of craft breweries and spur economic development in their local economies,” said Dr Isabelle Nilsson, assistant professor in the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
Condominiums in centre-city neighbourhoods recorded a nearly 3% increase on sales price after a brewery opened within a half mile, while single family homes in centre-city neighbourhoods saw a near 10% increase.
However the team found the presence of a brewery had no impact on the price of commercial properties.
“Being able to walk to a craft brewery in the evening or late afternoon on the weekend is considered a positive amenity that would – for some people – be attractive when looking at a house,” said Dr. Neil Reid, professor of geography and planning at The University of Toledo.
“There is a different attitude toward a craft brewery. It’s perceived differently than a liquor store or bar.”
According to the Brewers Association, craft breweries contributed US$76.2 billion to the US economy in 2017, providing more than 500,000 total jobs with more than 135,000 jobs directly at breweries or brewpubs.
“This new research shows that craft breweries contribute to increased property tax revenues for local governments, in addition to job creation and aiding neighbourhood revitalisation efforts,” Reid added.
“However, the effects to residential property values may not be as significant in places with higher rates of vacancies and lower population growth, as well as in more established cities such as Chicago or New York.”
The study was published in Growth and Change: A Journal of Urban and Regional Policy.

30 years ago, Ben Jones and Alf Allington founded London City Bond. Since then, it has grown, including its purchase of British & Foreign Wharf dating back to 1870, and developed into today’s LCB.
LCB’s “Olympus” warehouse
From one small warehouse on the north bank of the Thames at the Barrier, the estate has expanded to 10 sites throughout the whole of the UK , and executives say there is more to come.
As the demand for quality warehousing grows, so does the importance of providing a high level of customer service along with the back up systems support. “Put this into a mixture of demands from potential new customers of all shapes and sizes, the continued growth of our existing customer base and add in the hike in storage deemed by some customers as a necessary post Brexit precaution, and you arrive at the conclusion that even more capacity is needed,”  a spokesperson for LCB said.
Hence the latest acquisition to LCB’s portfolio – a new site at Melksham in Wiltshire. This consists of four former aircraft hangars each of which have been renovated with “particular emphasis on thermal resistance and industry led climate control systems.” A fifth hangar will become LCB’s transport hub for the South West region.
LCB have said that the first customer to occupy space at the Melksham site is Farr Vintners – “the world’s leading fine wine wholesaler”- who “perceived the advantages of dealing with LCB at this purposely designed site.”
An extension to LCB’s Global warehouse in Burton upon Trent is also under way, and agreements have been reached to acquire two further sites. The addition of a third site in Burton upon Trent, together with a new site in Leeds, will bring the total warehousing capacity to over 2 million square feet.
Over the years, LCB said it has “been fortunate in building the finest team of people for all aspects of the business.”
Managing director Alf Allington said: “our present market leadership places us in prime position for the next 30 years and beyond!”

The Bordeaux 2018 vintage faces a “benign” market where a combination of factors means buyers will not “chase at any price”, Liv-ex predicts.
In its annual pre-primeurs report, Liv-ex has examined the current state of the fine wine market, the possible effects of previous campaigns and current geopolitical factors to give an idea of what sort of environment the 2018 clarets will face when primeurs begin this spring/summer.
As is now well known, there is a real sense that the 2018 vintage in the Gironde has produced a good to extremely good vintage.
Volumes have bounced back strongly in most areas after severe losses to frost in 2017 but, as previously noted, isolated pockets of hail and larger outbreaks of “aggressive” mildew mean that certain châteaux suffered considerably and won’t have large amounts to offer.
So what’s the overall view? As Liv-ex noted, despite this apparently “desirable vintage in barrel”, the market is currently a complex place.
To begin with, as the Power 100 list made clear at the end of last year, the fine wine market is now a much more rounded place and while Bordeaux is still dominant within it, it is nowhere near as dominant as it was in the past.
Liv-ex said: “2018 saw Bordeaux prices hold steady, while its share of trade continued to decline, reaching  a new annual low of 59%.”
There’s also the problem that after the extremely good 2015 and 2016 vintages (the ‘new’ 2009/2010 duo) and a patchy 2017 campaign, “both collectors’ cellars and négociant warehouses are well stocked with young Bordeaux.”
And these factors alone make it, “improbable that buyers will chase Bordeaux 2018 at any price.”
Then there are other compounding factors. A big one has been the very clear policy from the campaign of the 2016s in particular (though several estates began doing so as early as 2010) for the Bordelais to hold back larger and larger amounts of stock in their own cellars.
This has been done with the hope of releasing at a later date, to help beef up years when stocks are small (such as 2017s) but also to try and achieve higher prices.
The problem, said Liv-ex, is: “The medium- to long-term impact of this strategy is difficult to compute but the rather lukewarm reaction to stellar in-bottle scores for the 2016 vintage hints at a possible supply-side cap on prices.”
Then there’s the problem of Brexit and the ‘will it? When will it? Won’t it? When won’t it? What’s going on?’ palaver of the whole thing.
A graph showing pricing from the châteaux from 2004 to 2017, compared to the annual progress of the Liv-ex Bordeaux 500 index and the vintages’ average score from The Wine Advocate
As Professor Colin Hay wrote recently for the drinks business, the effect it has on the value of the pound could very well be a determining and decisively so on the outcome of the campaign.
A stronger pound against the euro will have the obvious effect of making prices coming out of Bordeaux look more attractive than a weak pound and strong euro.
And it needs to be remembered that the UK remains the most single important foreign market for Bordeaux futures (a fact well-known since 2010 and made abundantly clear when the 2016s were released).
The US is a little more active than before but China and the rest of Asia-Pacific has not been a key buyer of en primeur since the 2010s were released. It is a market that prefers vintages ready to drink – hence another reason for estates to hold back stock – and anyway is going through an economic rough patch where the RMB is losing value too. So the UK should remain the focus of the Bordelais when considering who is actually going to buy these wines.
Another issue therefore is the news that one of if not the most influential British critic when it comes to Bordeaux, Neal Martin, has said he is sitting out this year’s pre-campaign tastings due to a health matter (though he has said he will taste the wines albeit at a slightly later date).
So in a key market like the UK where Bordeaux is less of a ‘must-buy’ than it was previously, cellars are full, the pound may be fatally weak and one of its leading critics is out of action, Liv-ex stressed that: “It is therefore more important than ever that release prices reflect the reality of the vintage’s quality, current market conditions and the very real political and economic uncertainties.”
On the other hand, added Liv-ex giving a little plug for its ‘Fair Value methodology’: “The conditions do seem ripe for a sensibly priced campaign. Both buyers and sellers have never been better equipped to make informed decisions. The market is more transparent today than it has ever been.”

Mixer brand Fever-Tree has reported a 40% increase in revenue to reach £237.4 million, with profit after tax amounting to £61.8 million in the year ending 31 December 2018.
Total revenue surpassed the brand’s expectations by just over £1 million after it released an initial trading update in January. Revenue rose by 40% to reach £237.4m, up from £170.2m in 2017, and profit after tax was £61.8m compared to £45.5m in the previous year.
The company also reported rises in gross profit margin (+51.8%) and adjusted EBITDA which hit £78.6 million, up from £58.7 million in 2017.
The final dividend came to 10.28 pence per share, bringing the total dividend for 2018 to 14.50 pence per share, up from 10.65 pence in the previous year.
In a statement, the company added that it had consolidated its position as the number one mixer brand by value in the UK, based on IRI data covering the total UK retail mixer market in the 13 weeks to 13 December 2018.
In June 2018, it had moved its US operations under its direct ownership with dedicated teams now managing its marketing, sales and distribution in the country. It now has a team of 35 people in the US, with a regional headquarters in New York. It noted that its ginger range remained a central focus in the US with it continuing to lead the sales mix in the country.
In March last year, the brand extended its low calorie range with eight new expressions, stating that sales of its light tonic had more than doubled in the UK.
In September 2018, it teamed up with Tequila brand Patrón to release a citrus tonic water flavoured with Mexican limes, tangerines and bitter orange, which has been specifically designed to pair with Tequila.
The business also noted that it had made gains across continental Europe in both the on- and off-trade, reporting revenue growth of 24% in 2018 and an “encouraging performance” in the rest of the world, up 48% on 2017. It has increased the number of retail partners in continental Europe, gaining new national listings in Germany, Denmark, Italy, Ireland and the Nordics. The company has also doubled its workforce in the region with its senior regional management team being complemented by additional hires to work in-country.
In the UK, Fever-Tree delivered revenue growth of 53% to reach £134.2m, up from £87.8m in 2017. It referred to its performance over the summer as “exceptional” boosted by the continued growth of the gin category, with more gin being sold during the three months of the summer in 2018 than the summers of 2014 and 2015 combined.
Commenting on the results, Tim Warrillow, co-founder and CEO of Fever-Tree said: “2018 was a significant year for Fever-Tree. In the UK, we strengthened our position as the leading mixer brand in the off-trade. In the US, we successfully established our own operations and the business made real progress in deepening and widening its presence in multiple European regions.
“As the world’s leading premium mixer brand with a strengthening global distribution network we are well set to drive the international opportunity as the move towards the premium long mixed drink continues to gather momentum around the world. At this early stage in the year, the group is trading in line with Board expectations and we remain excited about the size of the opportunity that lies ahead.”

Chatting to dbHK, the young sommelier shares his sources of joy from the service floor and intensive wine competitions, his desire to visit more wine regions, and his greatest vice, like many of us – social media.
What vintage are you? 
My vintage is 1988, not an exceptional one overall. But you may find some good bottles from Côte du Rhône and Madeira.
What bottle sparked your love of wine? 
It should be Château Angelus 2009. There was a half bottle leftover from a wine dinner. The guest gave it to me. I put the cork back to the bottle and I tasted it again after two days. The tannins had softened. The aroma became so generous and complex. After that, I realised that wine was full of life and possibility.
What would you be as a wine? 
A young Bordeaux red wine. It has potential, and a lot of room for developing.
Where are you happiest? 
On the service floor or at a sommelier competition. I love serving guests in a restaurant, seeing their happy faces after a nice dining experience that I have provided. It makes me feel satisfied and happy.
On the other hand, I love competition. It pushes me to learn more and to keep studying. I also earn friendship from around the world and have the chance to meet all the great sommeliers during the competition. The most meaningful part is that it gives me a chance to prove to the world that we, Hong Kong – such a small city – have the ability to stand on the international stage.
What’s your greatest vice? 
Youtube, Facebook, Instagram
Best advice you ever received? 
“A sommelier has to be humble.” It’s by the 2016 winner of Best Sommelier in the World, Mr. Jon Arvid Rosengren.
Your cellar’s underwater, which bottle would you dive in and save? 
I laughed when I read this question, because I don’t even have a cellar or a bottle of wine at home…
What’s the best and worst thing about the wine business? 
The best part of the wine business is that it brings people closer. It provides the bridges for people of the same interest from all over the world to connect and learn about each other’s cultures. The worst is how part of it is overly turned into a speculative business.
What’s on your wine bucket list? 
It will be a long list. To be honest, in these eight years of learning wine, I only had the opportunity to visit wineries in Alsace and Austria. It would be great to keep exploring the world, like Champagne, Piedmont, Burgundy, Mosel, Madeira, Barossa, and New Zealand, etc.
Who would you invite to your dream dinner party? 
Everyone who has helped me, inspired me, taught me, and been by my side along the challenging sommelier journey.
Personal satisfaction (Parker points – out of 100)?
79. I am very difficult to be satisfied. I still have a long way to go before achieving my goals at competitions, finding a fitting job, and being a great sommelier.
Which wine would you like to be served at your funeral?
I would say Charles Heidsieck Blanc des Millénaires 1995. But how dare you drink it without me?!

Scottish spirits label Whyte & Mackay has launched an experimental whisky range with two limited edition styles on sale.

Gregg Glass, Whyte & Mackay’s whisky blender, has launched The Whisky Works, a range of so-far two limited edition scotches; a classic whisky called The 29 Year Old Glaswegian and a modern, more experimental style called the King of Trees, which is a Highland Blended Malt, part-finished in native Scottish Oak. A total of 2,157 bottles will be released, while there are just ,642 individually numbered bottles of the 29 Year Old Glaswegian in circulation.
Glass said: “Along the way I have been fortunate to develop relationships with brilliant producers connected right along the whisky making process right back to the individual foresters that manage the woodland that produces our casks. The Whisky Works is a fantastic opportunity to celebrate what can be achieved in the production of a Scotch Whisky.”
King of Trees (priced at £75, 70cl) and 29 year-old Glaswegian (priced at £130, 70cl) will launch at Whisky Live London on Friday 29 and Saturday 30 March, with a masterclass led by Glass.

Majestic Wine boss Rowan Gormley said the ‘radical’ decision to sell its UK retail arm now, while the business was profitable gave it many more options, as he insisted the name was unlikely to disappear from the high street.
Rowan Gormley, CEO of Majestic Wines
Speaking exclusively to the drinks business this morning, Rowan Gormley scotched some of the speculation around Monday’s surprise announcement that Majestic is rebranding as Naked Wines and selling off its UK retail business to concentrate on its growing online wine subscription service, saying that while it may not be the “comfortable” thing to do, it gave the business more options.
“Lots of people have asked why are we doing this now and the answer is because we can, not because we have to. While that may feel radical to some people, by doing it now we have options,” he told db.
“We’re doing it now while the business is profitable, not when we’re against the wall in five years time.”
Gormley argued that this profitability meant Majestic was more likely to be sold as an ongoing concern, arguing that it was not in anyone’s interests to close down a profitable business.
“My expectation is that Majestic will keep as an on-going concern, which is fundamentally different to an LK Bennet, which was game over,” he told db.
“It may be split 10/90 one way, or 90/10 another way or 50/50, it doesn’t matter – but there will likely to be two businesses at the end of this, one of them is Naked, one of them is Majestic. They will still have a bunch of customers and there will still be opportunities for suppliers, and everyone else,”
“It’s a profitable business, and therefore it’s not in anyone’s interest to be shutting down a profitable business. What we’re saying is it is won’t be part of this business.”
Inevitable?
Gormley denied that reversing the merger had been inevitable, arguing that the logic that made them an “excellent strategic fit” three and a half years ago had changed over the last two years.
Majestic CEO Rowan Gormley with Naked Wines md Eamon FitzGerald at the time of the merger
“The strategic logic was that Majestic was generating cash and Naked was consuming cash. One of the fundamental things that’s changed is that Naked is no longer consuming cash, so the need to have those two companies together no longer exists” he told db. “If you looks at results for last two years, the pattern is well established. Online sales are growing at 20- 30%, and offline sales are shrinking, so what we’re doing with stores needs to change.”
There was, he added “a revolution” happening in retail – which wasn’t necessarily bad news, but in order to be one of the winners, the group needed to pick which side to back, a decision it said it flagged it “pretty heavily” six months ago.
It had become increasingly clear that Naked had the opportunity to be “a very substantial business” he continued, but to fulfil that would take more focused investment and time.
“Although we believe strongly Majestic can also be a winner, we don’t have money and resources to do both. One way or another we need to have a single business model and one brand, and therefore we either need to migrate [the businesses] together or take them further apart,” he said.
Currently the group is “testing the market” to determine the eventual scale and timescale of the sale of the Majestic businesses but Gormley remained tight-lipped about the fate of Majestic commercial and its fine wine arm, Lay & Wheeler, saying that the path for those businesses would be unveiled in June.
Increased cost base
Gormley admitted that the worsening economic climate and Brexit uncertainty had had an impact, having increased the cost base by up to £40million, through changes to the currency and exchange rate, impact of duty, rises in the minimum wage and rates increases, which he said “hadn’t helped”.
“When we first started we could see there were opportunity to improve the retail operation and the team have done a spectacular job doing exactly that. But I’ve previously described it as running really hard up a down escalator and when £40 million of cost gets dumped down on you, it’s really hard for a business to continue to grow it. And the fact that they have managed to do so is all the more credit to them.”
“We took a company with declining sales, but sales of £20 million, we’ve reversed the sales decline, and though we’ve had £40 million costs added through no choice of our own, we’ve still got it in double digit profitability.”
However he admitted that while there were retailers looking for space to expand, there was also the option to sell for residential, as already revealed by db.
“The alternative use for a lot of our sites is to develop them into flats for example, and not necessarily as retail, but there are retailers who are looking for space,” he said.
He added that there was still a future for specialist wine retailers.

Michael Stones, the producer behind the famous Carling Black Label ‘Dambusters’ advert in 1989, has died aged 75.
Stones was a producer at Park Village ad agency (which he founded with some former colleagues from Ridley Scott’s own agency RSA) and was one of the team behind the fondly remembered ad that was part of long train of ‘humorous’ beer adverts of the 1980s and 1990s, often with an historical theme.
The advert riffs on both the real 1943 events and famous 1955 film of the ‘Dambusters’ raid on the Möhne, Eder and Sorpe dams, in which the ‘bouncing bombs’ were used.
The advert features the British bombers come roaring in over the moonlit water to the mounting horror of a German sentry who has just spotted them.
Rather than running, however, the German ditches his sandwich and rushes down to the water level in the nick of time to save the dam by catching the – suspiciously football shaped – bomb.
He then proceeds to save four or five more in the best tradition of Bert Trautmann, Oliver Kahn or Sepp Maier (and this was of course the absolute peak of Anglo-German football rivalry).
As the final bomber flies off the pilot remarks ruefully if also rather impressed: “I bet he drinks Carling Black Label”.
The advert then finished with a ‘bouncing bomb’ skipping across four pints.
Due to concerns it might be disrespectful to veterans and families of Bomber Command, the advert was not aired on television but it was in cinemas ahead of the feature film and it amused everyone, especially veterans, so much that it eventually was transferred to the small screen as well (although other sources say it was meant only for screening in cinemas).
The advert was directed by Roger Woodburn and created by the WCRS ad agency team but Stones was vital in “getting the whole thing off the ground,” Woodburn later remarked and helped figure out how to get the ball to skip across the pint glasses in a time before computer graphics.
The “I bet” strapline had been used in a series of Carling adverts but the Dambusters version is often considered the funniest and won several awards for its creators.
Stones is survived by his wife and two children.

The future of UK wine retail is a mixture of face-to-face and experiential events such as pop-ups at festivals rather than bricks and mortar, the boss of Majestic Wines has claimed as the company looks to divest of its UK retail business arm to focus on its expanding internet and international business, Naked Wines.
Speaking to the drinks business today, Majestic CEO Rowan Gormley argued that in future, bricks and mortar estates would be “less important” to retailers than face-to-face events, in whatever form that took.
“There’s lots of speculation about what stores will look like in future, but I think it’s entirely feasible it will be pop-up and concessions and tasting cards at festivals rather than a 3,000 sq ft [on an] industrial estate,” he told db.
As a result of the fundamental reason behind the company’s dramatic change of business strategy which was announced this week was the change in customers’ behaviour.
“People will shop online if they want convenience, and if they come in store they want an experience,” he told db.
“That means a 3,000 sq. ft. warehouses piled to the roof filled with wine ain’t [sic] the future – but the people in those stores [are]. I firmly believe face-to-face has an important future, and to deliver that you need the right people.
“People inside the stores have an important future, four walls and a roof, not necessarily,” he said.
It was increasingly about “an experience rather than flogging wine” he argued, which required a more imaginative approach.
“I’m quite sure that it is doable but it does require original thinking,” he said.
As an example he pointed to Majestic’s Summertown store, in which only half the store contains wine, the other half consisting of a tasting area. Wines are grouped by taste style rather than grape or country to make it easier for customers to be matched to their ideal style and expand their repertoire of wines they might not otherwise try.
“The number of people who turn up and we find that they love Californian wine, but wouldn’t ask for it in a million years as they think it’s sweet and over-alcoholed – but when they blind taste it, they realise they like that style of wine. We’re also selling a lot of Grüner Veltliner to people who like Sauvignon Blanc, but they wouldn’t have come in and asked for Grüner Veltliner,” he noted.
The company has already revealed it will launch a new ‘face-to-face recruitment channel” for Naked, and also ‘migrate’ some Majestic consumers to the Naked brand, and Gormley argued that the customer bases were not as far apart as some analysts believed.
“If you go back five years, the traditional Majestic customer was quite different to who it is today – the received wisdom was that people wanted supermarket brands, but we’ve proved pretty conclusively that they are much more interested in genuine, authentic wines. The received wisdom was that they wouldn’t go online – that’s also proved to be completely untrue. So whereas four years ago the received wisdom said there were two very different customer-bases [for Majestic and Naked], over the four years, actually the proposition have become much closer than they were.”

Mark Knopfler OBE, the frontman of London rock band Dire Straits, is partnering with Portobello Road distillery on a new gin flavoured with olive oil.

London-based Portobello Road is launching the third gin in its “Local Heroes” series. Having worked with Notting Hill residents from the culinary world on past editions, Portobello has gone for a star from a different walk of life by teaming up with Knopfler, named by Rolling Stone Magazine as one of the fifty greatest guitarists of all time.
He was the lead singer, lead guitarist and songwriter of Dire Straits, as well as founder of roots band The Notting Hillbillies.
The artist worked with Portobello Road Gin’s co-founder, Jake F. Burger to create Local Heroes No.3, which combines Portobello Road Gin’s nine signature botanicals with lime zest, fresh cucumber peel and olive oil.
The product launch also coincides with the opening of a new stage musical adaptation of the classic Scottish film, Local Hero, that Mark has composed.
The musical opens on March 23rd at the Royal Lyceum Theatre Edinburgh before transferring to The Old Vic in May 2020.
Knopfler will embark on a global tour in support of his forthcoming ninth studio album, Down the Road Wherever, on 25 April.
Previous editions have seen Portobello Road Gin working with Brett Graham, head chef and proprietor of Notting Hill restaurant The Ledbury, and Italian Masterchef judge Carlo Cracco.
“As a gin fan, it is a wonderful opportunity to work with a prestigious brand like Portobello Road Gin to craft my own blend,” Knopfler said.
“This project allowed us to share our vision and I’m incredibly proud of the results. It is robust in flavour and strong in spice – exactly the kind of gin that I enjoy and I hope my fans will too.”
Burger said that the singer was introduced to us by Brett Graham. “After meeting with Mark and his management for lunch and bonding over a mutual love of music and gin, the collaboration was agreed.”
“The addition of olive oil results in a wonderfully smooth finish making it a great gin for Martinis and of course Gibsons, which of course shares its name with the iconic guitar brand.”
Portobello Road is known for working unconventional flavours into its spirits. The distillery created a smoked gin in 2016 to mark the 350th anniversary of the Great Fire of London. In 2017, as part of its Director’s Cut range – a project launched every year to mark the brand’s birthday and that of it’s founder Ged Feltham – it launched what it claims is the world’s first ‘pechuga’ gin, an expression distilled with an organic turkey breast.
The new gin, which comes in at 42% ABV, will be sold for £40 from Portobello Road Gin’s website as well as the distillery’s bottle shop in west London.

Accolade Wines is rolling out limited edition ‘everyday’ celebration labels on its Echo Falls range, as part of a new marketing campaign to drive purchase among consumers.
The 30 light-hearted ‘everyday occasion’ labels will features on its top four skus – Chardonnay, Merlot, White Zinfandel and Pinot Grigio – promoting sharing occasions such as ‘It’s your birthday!’, ‘Fri-Yay’, ‘I love you’, ‘Wine Wednesday’ and ‘Movie Night’.
It is being supported by a range of branded point-of-sale material for retailers, including barkers, trolley bays and shelf wobblers as well as digital and online support.
Accolade Wine’s marketing director David White said the labels tapped into the “fun, spontaneous” side of the brand that “doesn’t take itself too seriously”.
“The target of 30 plus female consumer identifies with the fun and positive brand messaging of Echo Falls, which is all about enjoyment. These occasion driven labels displayed on our top four still wines, show the relaxed, spontaneous spirit of the brand,” he said.
“We are confident that the Echo Falls occasion labels will drive additional consumer purchase, both planned and impulse. They create a talking point in store and at home, helping to spread the popularity of Echo Falls.”
Last month the company launched a new rosé wine and gin fusion under the Echo Falls brand, following the earlier introduction of of a fruit-infused vodka in 2018, Echo Falls Summer Berries Vodka, and a Prosecco, ProsEcho Falls, to tap into the growing popularity of the Italian sparkler.
Last year value sales of Echo Falls fell 9% to £163 million  according to Nielsen (52 weeks 21 April 2018), a fall or around £16.2 million year-on-year, on volumes down 11.7%.

Naked Wines is eyeing up massive expansion in its US business, following its decision to sell of its UK retail arm, Majestic Wine, and rebrand to concentrate on the online wine subscription business.
Concept of American wine industry.
Speaking to the drinks business this week, group CEO Rowan Gormley said the company was likely to dramatically increase its US operation, which was likely to account for more than half of its sales.
In November parent group Majestic revealed US growth had risen by 19.3% and made up around half of the total Naked business, contributing around 15% of sales to the wider Majestic Group. Speaking at the time, group chief financial officer James Crawford said the US was the “growth driver” of the Naked business, and in time, the wider group. 
This week the company shocked the market by announcing it would sell some of its UK retail stores and rebrand the company as Naked Wine in order to focus on growing its online and international business. Around £26million will be invested in expanding the customer base over the coming financial year, up from £20 million last year, it said. 
Sales at Naked wine are expected to exceed £175 million this year, having netted around £600m since the two companies merged in 2015.
Gormley said it had become clear Naked Wines had the opportunity to be a very substantial business but to fulfil that the group needs to focus its investment and time into growing  Naked. “Although we believe strongly Majestic can also be a winner, we don’t have money and resources to do both,”  he said.
Equity research analyst at Liberum Wayne Brown told db success in both sides of the business was “mutually exclusive” and using the value within Majestic to invest behind the US would leave a Naked Wines business with the US as the primarily growth driver.
“I am confident Naked wine will become a very good business, it’s grown well and generates a decent return. I’ve always been a fan of that as a strategy, what surprised me is that you have to sacrifice Majestic Wine in its whole – it seems very harsh.” he told db.
Cracking the US market is notoriously hard for traditional retailers, however Gormley pointed out the company’s online subscription business, in which ‘angel’ investors provide funding for independent winemakers from around the world to bring them to market, in return for wines at ‘wholesale’ prices, was not a traditional retailer.
“We buy grapes and make wine, so we’re a winery and the regulations for wineries are much less restrictive for wineries than retailers,” he told db.
Peel Hunt’s analyst Pritchard told db earlier this week the whole business strategy moving forward was contingent on the viability of the US market working out for them, but after a series of false starts, it appeared to have got “the quality of consumer they’re after”.
“If that works it will be very interesting for them, if it doesn’t, well, it will be interesting for them in the other direction,” he told db.
However Gormley pointed out the growth opportunity didn’t lie exclusively in the US.
“Our Australian business grew 20% last year and the UK grew 10% too, so we are experiencing growth in all three markets,” he said.
Further details on the development of the Naked business are set to be revealed in June.
In the interview, Gormley said the “radical” change in tack was being made now to give the business more options, as he insisted the name was unlikely to disappear from the high street.

Hip-hop artist and celebrity G-Eazy is an investing partner and co-creative director of the company, which Beckerman alleges is now in “mortal danger” due to the “financial malfeasance of Bacardi and the other financial partners”.
The lawsuit alleges that Bacardi, who acquired a minority stake in the brand in four years ago, convinced Beckerman to provide it inside access and control of Stillhouse through a series of false representations and promises of support.
To induce Beckerman to relinquish majority ownership and control of Stillhouse, Bacardi represented to Beckerman that it would in the future bring Stillhouse “in house,” by buying all of the equity of Stillhouse, including Beckerman’s, at a fair market price”, a press release from Stillhouse states.
The lawsuit claims that in February and March 2019 the company has seen record breaking success and sales, and is now worth in excess of $100 million. But that Bacardi has “schemed to take the company on the cheap”, and has “cut off funding for the company.”
Bacardi has instead presented a “take it or leave it” offer to all of the equity holders, to sell to Bacardi their interests in Stillhouse at substantially below market value – and if not funding ends.
The lawsuit states: “Bacardi has put a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the Board. Bacardi’s offer is for Stillhouse to transfer all of its assets to Bacardi for no upfront payment to the company or to any of the minority members.
“For the minority members, Bacardi has offered payments that are contingent upon Stillhouse reaching certain case volume thresholds and would not be paid out until at least five years from now.”
‘ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY’
Bacardi meanwhile has defended its position, saying that it has provided “substantial backing” for Stillhouse over the years but that the company had “continued to spend beyond the board-approved budgets” and “repeatedly failed to deliver the growth promised”, and was consequently now “on the verge of bankruptcy”.
In a statement, Bacardi said: “We made a minority investment in Stillhouse over four years ago because we believed it could be an exciting and disruptive product, and we provided the company with significant ongoing financial and other support.
“Despite our substantial backing, management repeatedly failed to deliver on the company’s business plan and Stillhouse is now on the verge of bankruptcy. Under the leadership of CEO Brad Beckerman, the company has repeatedly failed to deliver the growth promised, and continued to spend beyond the board-approved budgets.
“For nearly six months, we have been diligently working with the other shareholders to find a solution that would save the business. It is very unfortunate that Mr Beckerman would jeopardise Stillhouse’s ability to continue as a going concern by unilaterally filing this frivolous lawsuit just as we were nearing a mutually beneficial resolution.
“The complaint is filled with inaccuracies and misstatements, and we look forward to providing the entire story at the appropriate time. We intend to defend this action vigorously.”

The second of five Lalique decanters containing an 1863 Port from the Niepoort family has set a new world record for the fortified wine at a Hong Kong auction.
The limited edition decanter and its 156 year-old contents were bought for HK$1,054,000 (US$134,000/£102,000) at The Nature Conservancy’s charity auction at Hong Kong’s Grand Hyatt Hotel on 22 March.
All proceeds will to The Nature Conservancy, an organisation that funds global partnerships and projects to tackle issues surrounding conservation of the natural world, to support its efforts in Asia-Pacific.
The price of this decanter, builds on the record set by the sale of the first (also in Hong Kong) last year.
US auctioneer Acker Merrall & Condit sold the first (dedicated to Franciscus Marius von der Niepoort the founder of the company), in November last year for HK$992,000 (US$128,000/£96,100) – itself also a record for Port sold at auction.
Current owner of Niepoort, Dirk van der Niepoort, said: “We are thrilled to achieve another landmark price for what is the oldest Port we have ever bottled, commemorating our remarkable journey over five generations.”
The Nature Conservancy sale was hosted by Sotheby’s and featured 35 luxury lots of fine wine (there was some large format 1982 Château Lafite, 1989 Haut-Brion and Opus One as well), fine art, ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ experiences and other collectables.
In total US$8.4 million was raised during the event.

The European Commission has approved the addition of ‘Tequila’ to its register of geographical indications (GI), giving it the same recognition as EU spirit geographical indications.

The GI was adopted on 27 February and entered into force on 20 March.
There are currently 31 geographical indications protected in the EU register originating from third countries (food, wines and spirits included), benefitting from the same protection and market added-value as EU protected products.
Tequila will be the third spirit to join the EU register of GIs as a third country product. The two existing ones are Pisco from Peru and Ron de Guatemala rum.
“We know very well in Europe how the international success of a regional spirit drink can help to create high-quality jobs in rural areas and generate a strong sense of local and national pride,” said Phil Hogan, commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development.
“I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to our Mexican colleagues. The addition of Tequila to the EU GI Spirits is the latest step on the EU-Mexico journey of cooperation.”
Made from the blue agave plant, Tequila can only be called such if it is produced in the state of Jalisco in Mexico, home to the city of Tequila.
It is made by distilling the juices extracted from the heart of the blue agave, with the best Tequilas labelled as 100% blue agave.

California’s Stone Brewing has failed to secure an immediate injunction against MillerCoors to stop it from using its trademarked ‘Stone’ name, however the judge stated it had a “moderately strong” claim as the case moves to trial.
In a ruling on Wednesday (27 March), the US District Court in San Diego failed to grant Stone Brewing a preliminary injunction as it concluded that the brewer did not prove that it would be irreparably harmed without one.
In a 21-page decision, however, US District Judge Roger Benitez said that Stone Brewing had a “moderately strong” trademark claim against MillerCoors.
Benitez added: “Stone falls far short of demonstrating that it would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the Court granting a preliminary injunction.”
“The Court agrees [with Stone], especially considering the marks incontestability, Stone® is entitled to the strong protection afforded to suggestive marks. Since Stone and Miller both produce a beer which is distributed nationally, a consumer is likely to encounter both within close proximity of the other, making it is reasonable to consider Miller a direct competitor of Stone.”
“Taking all the factors into account, the Court finds that Stone’s trademark infringement claim against Miller is moderately strong.”
Stone Brewing filed its lawsuit in February last year following the rebrand of MillerCoors’ Keystone beer, which it says emphasises the word “stone” rather than “key” and represents an effort to create confusion in the marketplace with their own brand.
In April, MillerCoors responded with an 82-page document, claiming Stone Brewing’s lawsuit was “misleading and ultimately meritless”.
Rather than placing greater emphasis on the world ‘stone’, MillerCoors claimed every can is clearly labelled with ‘Keystone’. In addition, the brewing giant states that it registered a trademark for ‘Keystone’ “nearly a decade before Stone Brewing registered ‘Stone’”.
MillerCoors also stated that this case is not about trademarks, but rather “Stone Brewing’s struggle with its new identity as a global mega-craft beer manufacturer”.
In response to this week’s court proceedings, Stone CEO Dominic Engels said: “MillerCoors has made hundreds of millions of dollars from rebranding Keystone in a way that infringes on our trademark. It also has hurt Stone and our brand.”
On Twitter, Stone Brewing continued: “The judge overseeing our case against MillerCoors and Keystone confirmed our primary claim: MillerCoors is infringing our long-held trademark.
“The court outright rejected MillerCoors’ primary defence that Keystone’s new packaging is unlikely to cause confusion. This is a milestone event. No pun intended. We’re heading to trial to prove that corporate beer has made hundreds of millions from rebranding Keystone.⁣
To any believer in independent craft beer, today is a good day.⁣ ⁣Onward.⁣ #TrueStonevsKeystone⁣.”
MillerCoors is also fighting a legal battle with AB InBev, having filed a lawsuit against the world’s largest brewer over its “false and misleading advertising campaign” shown during this year’s Super Bowl.

London is home to a remarkable pool of talented wine personalities who are devoted to helping diners enjoy the diverse world of wine. But the people behind the best wine lists in London rarely get the recognition they deserve, especially compared to their chef counterparts.

It was with that in mind that we decided to publish a guide to the Top 50 Most Powerful Sommeliers in London, putting a face to the people who work to ensure that London’s on-trade wine offer remains among the most exciting in the world.
The guide followed on from our Wine List Confidential Top 100 restaurants for wine in London – which ranks restaurants on the strength of its wine list alone – in May last year. We felt it was time to shine a brighter light on the people behind those lists.
And so we introduce Wine List Confidential’s Top 10 Most Powerful Sommeliers in London 2019. The people profiled in this guide have been ordered loosely according to the rankings of restaurants in last year’s Wine List Confidential.

In other words, their position in this publication is related to the ranking of their establishment in our wine list guide from 2018 – which you can order from winelistconfidential.com.

DBR Lafite has broken its exclusivity with ASC Fine Wines in order to work with more distributors including Pernod Ricard, which is rumoured to be taking on the French wine group’s two volume brands, ‘Légende’ and ‘Saga’.
Yoshi Shibuya in Chengdu giving a briefing on ASC’s performance in 2018
Rumours of a break-up between DBR Lafite and ASC Fine Wines have been swirling in the wine trade for a few months, but contrary to industry chatters it has become clear that ASC Fine Wines will still continue to work with DBR Lafite, which was also confirmed by ASC’s CEO Yoshi Shibuya to dbHK in Chengdu.
Although full details of the arrangement have not been revealed yet, as Shibuya admitted that things have not yet been completely finalised, he said: “Officially speaking I have nothing to say. I haven’t signed anything. Third party hasn’t signed anything.”
It’s not completely clear how DBR Lafite’s portfolio, which includes Domaine d’Aussières in southern France, Los Vascos in Chile, Bodegas Caro in Argentina, and ‘Légende’, ‘Saga’ and ‘Reserve’ from Bordeaux in addition to its classified growths, isgoing to be divided among its distributors in mainland China,
dbHK has asked DBR Lafite for additional comments.
Nonetheless, it appears that Pernod Ricard is going to take on ‘Légende’, ‘Saga’, two generic Bordeaux blends that have become extremely successful in the Chinese market because of their association with the Lafite brand.
However, speaking of the brands that ASC is going to work with under DBR Lafite’s profile, largely believed to be Los Vascos and Domaine d’Aussières, Shibuya emphasised that the brands are what he calls the, “most valuable wines” DBR is making, and each has “a story behind it, its own vineyard where people work hard to grow for the best grapes to make the best wines with its terroir”.
“This is what I want to emphasise to everybody including our staff”, he noted.
This also comes at a time when ASC Fine Wines announced a return to its core business, fine wine, with a marked departure from “big” and “commercial” brands, the company CEO revealed.
“I dare to express my regret that the company has been heavily dependent on commercial wines, big brands for years. Maybe forgetting the origin of the company. I am convinced that we must go back to the origin of the company. This is the only way we can continue to thrive and provide value for the consumers,” he said.
Ultimately, the goal of the wine importing company is to act as “a lighthouse” for consumers and trade professionals, he continued.
This delineation of brands is also in line with ASC parent company Suntory Group’s overall goal for the Chinese market, which is to develop the premium side of the market, especially for the on-trade sector he continued.
Explaining the decision, Shibuya said: “When you look at the on-trade, commercial brands are not respected. They don’t want to work with major brands because customers coming into the restaurant, they see very commercial brands on the wine list and identify how much it sells immediately. Consumers and trade need to learn more about artisanal, less known and more valuable wines…If you are selling just commercial big volume, on-trade professionals and sommeliers will no longer work with us.”
In line with this philosophy, the company recently added four more French labels to its protfolio this year; Provence rosé Miraval, and three family owned Burgundian estates.
In the coming years, ASC Fine Wines revealed that it will work more closely with Suntory Group’s other divisions including its own own business, spirits, beer and soft drinks sectors for the Chinese market.
“We could make more synergy with the overall direction with the group,” Shibuya commented.
Founded by Don St. Pierre Sr. and his son in 1996, ASC was sold to Japanese Suntory Group in 2010 for an undisclosed amount.

Wine brand The Vineyard House has filed a lawsuit against Constellation Brands over California’s To Kalon vineyard, as seven different entities now lay claim to ownership of parts of the historic site.
Image: Beckstoffer Vineyards
To Kalon, which was bought by Henry Walker Crabb in 1868, has long been the centre of legal battles and trademark disputes. This month, another dispute has arisen after Jeremy Nickel, founder of the The Vineyard House wine brand, filed a lawsuit at the US District Court on 18 March.
Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville, owned by Constellation Brands, obtained a trademark for “To Kalon” name in 1988 and “To Kalon Vineyard” in 1994. Seven (including The Vineyard House) different entities now lay claim to ownership of parts of the vineyard, the principal owners, aside from Robert Mondavi, being Opus One and grower Andy Beckstoffer.
Crabb initially bought 240 acres of land near Oakville in 1868, with a winery following in 1872. In 1881, he bought a further 119 acres of land next to his original vineyard, with the total area now totalling 359 acres. Disputes have arisen as to whether all of these 359 acres are the To Kalon vineyard, or, as this most recent lawsuit has alleged, a further 165 acres of land on higher ground, which Crabb acquired in the late 1880s and didn’t plant, should also be included.
The name To Kalon was first used by Crabb in reference to his winery in 1886. Crabb passed away in 1899.
Jeremy Nickel of The Vineyard House is suing Constellation Brands for the cancellation of trademarks and unfair business practices. The lawsuit states that Nickel owns 17 acres of a 168-acre parcel of land bought by Crabb in the late 1880s, some 20 years after he bought the original To Kalon vineyard.
The complaint states that the 17 acres “clearly dates back to Crabb and the original To Kalon estate comprised of land which Crabb owned at the time of his death.”
The lawsuit goes on to refer to Constellation’s trademarks as “geographically deceptively mis-descriptive of the origin of the goods, especially given that the Alcohol & Tobacco Tax & Trade Bureau has enumerated rules and regulations regarding the manner in which vineyard designations can appear, specifically stating that where the name of a vineyard is used, 95% of the wine must be produced from primary winemaking materials grown on the named vineyard.”
It added that consumers “are likely to believe that they [Constellation’s wines] originate in the historic To Kalon estate when in fact, they could actually be made from grapes grown in far off places such as Nairobi.”
Constellation owns 188 acres of what Nickel calls the original Crabb vineyard (the 359 acres plus the 165 acres on higher land). The company owns another 361 acres which are not part of the To Kalon property, according to the lawsuit. Because of this, Nickel argues in the court document that Constellations’ To Kalon Vineyard includes land that was not part of the original estate owned by Crabb.
He is calling for Constellation’s trademarks to be revoked and is asking to be able to use the To Kalon name on his wines produced under The Vineyard House brand.
A spokesperson for The Vineyard House, said: “The Vineyard House’s position is that anyone who is producing grapes from the original Crabb estate, the original To Kalon property, ought to be able to call it To Kalon.”
In a statement, Constellation Brands said the allegations “are without merit.” It continued: “Constellation Brands is committed to operating with the highest degree of ethics and integrity and in full accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, as we have for more than 70 years.”
The lawsuit follows a similar argument put forward by grower Andy Beckstoffer in a lawsuit in 2002. He argued that To Kalon was a place and should therefore not be allowed to be trademarked for marketing purposes.
In 2017, Constellation attempted register three more trademarks: To Kalon Wine Company’, ‘To Kalon Vineyard Company’ and ‘Rooted in To Kalon’. The drinks giant later abandoned these applications, instead registering ‘The Miracle of To Kalon’ and ‘To Kalon 1886’ in 2018.
Constellation bought Napa Valley Cabernet specialist Schrader cellars for US$60 million in 2017. Schrader, which producers Old Sparky’ Cabernet from the To Kalon vineyard, has neither a winery nor vineyards, instead buying all of its grapes from Andy Beckstoffer.

China’s leading wine importer, ASC Fine Wines, has signed a deal with the country’s oldest and biggest winery, Changyu Pioneer Wine Company, to distribute its premium wines from Ningxia across China, targeting Michelin-starred restaurants and high-end hotels.
Yoshi Shibuya, CEO of ASC Fine Wines, and Zhou Hongjiang, chairman of Changyu Pioneer Wine Company signing a co-operation agreement in Chengdu on 21 March
The partnership was characterised by Yoshi Shubuya, CEO of ASC Fine Wines, as a collaboration between “two giants” during a press briefing in Chengdu, the capital of China’s southwestern Sichuan province.
The deal would allow Changyu’s four premium wines from its Ningxia-based winery (Château Changyu Moser XV) to be distributed through ASC Fine Wines’ on-trade channel, leveraging the wine importer’s long standing HORECA network particularly with Michelin-starred restaurants and top hotels.
Additionally, Changyu in turn will help distribute selected wines represented by ASC Fine Wines via Changyu’s existing national sales channels, according to Shibuya.
This marks ASC’s second push on domestically produced Chinese wines alongside its partnership with China’s leading family-owned winery Grace Vineyard.
Opened in 2012, the European-styleChâteau Changyu Moser XV winery cost €70 million, and makes a range of Cabernet-led reds as well as some whites.

The marriage between WBWE Asia and the Annual Congress of the National Wine and Fruit Industry will see the latter bringing in more than 200 oenologists and China’s biggest wine producers such as Changyu Wine Pioneer Company, COFCO, Wei Long to the two-day fair on 30 and 31 May.
This is expected to provide a rare networking opportunity for wineries and producers to get in direct contact with the most prominent and respected oenologists in China including Li Demei, known as China’s Michel Rolland. Many of the oenologists are said to responsible for purchasing million litres of wine according to the fair organiser.
Wineries from 15 countries including Chile, Australia, France, Georgia, Italy, Macedonia, Moldova, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Ukraine, Uruguay, China, Brazil and New Zealand have confirmed their attendance at the first World Bulk Wine Exhibition in Yantai.
Yantai, is known as China’s ‘City of Wine’ and the country’s most important port of entry for bulk wine. More than 80% of the bulk wine that enters China each year is via the port of Yantai. This means 135 million litres out of China’s overall volume of 170 million litres entered via Yantai, according to official data.

The beer giant announced the name change alongside new targets for its UK business, including to “champion Britain’s iconic beer culture with trade-boosting programmes for the whole community, from barley farmers to pubs and retail,” as well as accelerating its sustainability targets, encouraging mindful drinking, and “continuing to invest in premium drinks and powerful brands.”
Ab InBev, which makes Stella Artois, Budweiser, Corona, Michelob Ultra, Bud Light, Beck’s, Bass and Boddingtons, chose Budweiser as it is the company’s most globally recognisable name, according to an emailed statement.
The company hired a new sales director in the UK in January amid a reshuffle of the management team.
The UK business has also pledged to accelerate its sustainability and mindful drinking initiatives. Low and no-ABV beer made up around 8% last year according to its latest financial results. The company said it expects low and no products to make up 20% of its global volumes by 2025.
Paula Lindenberg, President of Budweiser Brewing Group UK&I, said: “We are a fast-paced, ambitious group that dreams big, and we have exciting plans ahead for the UK and Ireland. Through the power and recognition of the Budweiser brand, we want to open ourselves up to working with more partners to achieve our ambitions.
“We are looking forward to making a big impact in the year ahead, working towards brewing our beers with 100% renewable electricity and accelerating our progress towards 20% of our global products being no or low alcohol.”

A new hi-tech drone, which emits fake bird distress calls, is being trialled in Australia in an effort to scare avians away from ripening grapes and reduce crop losses.

As reported by The Herald, the project is being led by Sydney University School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering PhD candidate Zi Wang.
Wang, 26, is trialling the drone, or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), in vineyards in the Hunter Valley, Hilltops and Orange in New South Wales.
The UAV mimics bird behaviour, emitting fake distress calls as it flies over the vines. In order for the birds to see the drone, Wang has attached a dummy crow to the undercarriage.
The operating system for the drone uses GPS and is equipped with an antenna and long-range telemetry radio. The aim is for the system to detect the presence of birds, and automatically launch in response, scaring the birds away from the grapes.
Results from the trials will be compared to other more conventional bird deterrents such as netting and auditory bird scarers.
Speaking to The Herald, NSW Department of Primary Industries viticulture development officer Darren Fahey, said that he estimates crop losses due to birds can cause the country AU$300 million-a-year. He added that early trials of the UAV had indicated that it had the potential “to eliminate birds from vineyards.”
This is not the first time that a drone has been used to scare away pests from vineyards. In 2014, a US company has developed a similar drone that was also capable of collecting vital environmental data for winemakers.
Tech company Precision Hawk designed its drones to resemble a hawk. The Lancaster Mark III, released in 2014, weighs only 1.3kg and is capable of collecting data on crop protection and crop production.

Drones have also been used by drinks companies and establishments to perform different tasks, such as a hotel which delivers Champagne to its penthouse guests by drone, and a bar in Minnesota which has been known to deliver cold beers by drone to fisherman out on the state’s frozen lakes.
Robots are also being used by the industry, with Symington Family Estates trialling robotic vineyard helpers back in 2017. Called VineScout, the bot is designed to be autonomous and capable of monitoring temperature and taking other readings to help viticulturists and winemakers with vineyard management. The robot will help areas where de-population of the countryside – with younger people moving en masse to the cities, a real problem in Spain and Portugal – is making labour harder and more expensive to find.
Symington are part of the five-member pan-European consortium that is developing the robot over a three-year period. The consortium hopes to have the VineScout ready for series production from 2019/20.

American’s spent almost US$10 billion more on spontaneous drunken purchases this year compared to last, according to a survey that found that men do more drunk shopping than women, with millennials the top spenders.
Collectively, Americans spent US$39.4 billion on drunk purchases in the past 12 months, up from last year’s $30.43 billion.
The percentage of Americans that admit to buying under the influence decreased to 26% in 2019, from 46% in 2018, however the amount spent per person has increased, according to Finder.com, an annual survey of roughly 2,000 American adults about their boozed buying habits.
Collectively, Americans spent $39.4 billion on drunk purchases in the past 12 months, up from last year’s $30.43 billion.
In 2017, the average American spent $206 per year on items while under the influence. That figure jumped to $447.57 per person in the 2018 findings, and now stands at $736, according to the latest survey.
Interestingly, men are more likely than women to drunk shop, spending an average $870 on drunk purchases, compared to women who spent only $511.
Food and cigarettes are common purchases, but 38% of men also admitted to buying shoes and clothing, compared to women (52%).
The top purchase for women under the influence is food, with 58% admitting to buying a spontaneous meal after a drink, compared with 48% for men.
When it comes to the generations, millennials spent the most when under the influence – an average of $1,047. That’s more than double the spending of baby boomers ($466) and Gen X ($469). Of the generations, Gen Xers (60%) are more likely to consume alcohol regularly than boomers (57%) and millennials (54%).

The Bordeaux appellation of St Emilion is reportedly planning to make organic and sustainable viticulture a requirement of its regulations by the early 2020s.
Speaking to the drinks business in London recently, representatives of the regional trade body, the Bordeaux Wine Council, mentioned the fact while discussing the various green and environmentally friendly initiatives being put into place across the region.
As well as St Emilion, it was also revealed that the AOC Bordeaux Superieur is looking into new requirements involving reduced use of pesticides and herbicides among other measures in order to make viticulture more environmentally friendly.
The president of the Bordeaux Wine Council, Allan Sichel, explained that there were a raft of programmes currently happening or being considered in the region ranging from looking into new disease-resistant varieties to bat conservation and removal of copper from the soil using cover crops.
He said that 60% of the viticulture in Bordeaux today is sustainable, organic or biodynamic and the use of harmful chemicals has fallen sharply in the last decade, falling from 30% of all substances sprayed on vines in the region to less than 10%. The aim is for Bordeaux to be 100% sustainable/organic/biodynamic (or at least in conversion) by 2025.
Changes were being implemented at an array of estates both big and small. Sichel said that when the Environment Management System programme was launched by the Bordeaux Wine Council in 2010 it had 25 estates signed up, today that number is 800.
Furthermore, of the 1,200 companies (not just viticultural) in France that have been certified as ‘Haut Valeur III’ – the highest level of recognised sustainable practices – 400 are in the Gironde.
The EMS has proved to be so successful because it gives growers access to a system that helps them either begin being sustainable or continue to be by putting them in touch with other growers to share best practice and even equipment.
As Sichel said, “We can’t make things compulsory but we can make it easier.”
But he also said it was important to be “pragmatic” and organics was not the solution for everyone, particularly in Bordeaux where the maritime climate makes outbreaks of rot and mildew and real possibility (as happened last year in fact).
Nonetheless, there is change and as much as 50% of the vineyard land in Bordeaux could in theory be certified organic now, even if only 8% of the surface area is actually certified.
“It shows a total change in the state of mind,” he said, noting producers today are more, “careful and prudent with the products they’re using”.

The announcement that Majestic Wine is throwing its lot behind its online wine subscription business, Naked Wines and will divest some (if not all?) of its UK retail business has raised more questions than it has answered. db looks at some of the issues raised by today’s announcement.
 
Rowan Gormley, CEO of Majestic Wines
Why are they changing tack?
Many analysts have been shocked by the unforeseen change in tack in the company’s strategy announced this morning, in which UK specialist retailer Majestic Wine announced it will close stores and rebrand as Naked Wine as it concentrates on its online and international business. Bearing in mind CEO Gormley still insists the recently transformed Majestic business had “the potential to be a long-term winner”, some argue the latest move smacks of “throwing the baby out with the bathwater”.
Equity Research Analyst at Liberum Wayne Brown said there was no doubt retail was challenging on the high street and there was always likely to be an estate rationalisation strategy at some point, but he questioned why the group would completely reshape the business, when only three and a half years ago, it thought it was an excellent idea to put these two businesses together.
“Why was it a good idea then and why is it a bad idea today?” he asked.
The difference, he pointed out to db was that having merged the two businesses, Naked Wines has benefited from the cash flow from Majestic.
“As the statement clearly says, you can’t maximise the value of Naked wines now with Majestic in the same group, you can’t invest behind Naked Wines properly so in order to achieve that, they’re closing down as many stores as they can, selling on the business, selling the freeholds and probably using that last bit of value and cash to throw back into Naked Wines.”
Which is somewhat hard luck on Majestic, particularly as it had been loudly trumpeted as having turned itself around amid a difficult backdrop, following major investment in its stores. But as Peel Hunt analyst Jonathan Pritchard points out, “They’ve gone from making nearly £20 million in 2015 to £10 million profit this year, and that doesn’t sound great to me.”
Majestic’s CEO Rowan Gormley today insisted the recently transformed Majestic business had “the potential to be a long-term winner” – but the group “risk[ed] not maximising the potential of Naked if we try to do both.”
Essentially, the focus is too split for both businesses to grow, and the group has chosen to back its Naked Wines business, which has more than doubled in size since it was acquired by Majestic in April 2015 with sales expected to exceed £175 million this year, over the more challenging UK retail arm.
As Pritchard notes, “You could say this has been brewing for four years. Ever since Majestic was taken over by Naked, it’s been the slightly less favoured child in the relationship.”
Which rather raises the question: was this inevitable all along?

The Stafford hotel in London’s St James’ is set to open a new, independent Sicilian-inspired restaurant this summer in partnership with its culinary director Ben Tish.
The Stafford’s culinary director Ben Tish with its general manager Stuart Proctor
Based on Charlotte Street, in Fitzrovia, Norma’s cuisine will be inspired by the food and culture of Sicily with particular emphasis on the Moorish influences on the Island’s cuisine.
The restaurant itself is described as “contemporary and provocative, whilst embodying the celebrated old-school Italian hospitality and charm”, and will also take inspiration from the grand café culture found in Sicily.
Speaking about the new restaurant, executive chef, Ben Tish, said: “It’s a concept I’m passionate about and have been working on for a while. I’m intrigued by Sicily and the Moorish influences found in its culture and architecture, and Norma has been inspired by much time eating and drinking though this part of the world.”
Housed in a converted characterful townhouse on Charlotte Street, the restaurant will be split across three floors: the bottom two will be dedicated to the restaurant and a first-floor cocktail bar, with the top floor a private dining space.
There will also be a crudo bar at the entrance of Norma, serving up seasonal raw seafood, dressed in olive oils and other flavourings.
Dishes will make use of seasonal Italian and British produce, and will include a selection of anti-pasti and pastas, to larger grilled meat and fish dishes.
Upstairs in the private dining room, guests will be able to order large family-style sharing dishes including whole fish and platters of seasonal vegetables.
The opening of Norma follows the launch of The Game Bird, within The Stafford hotel, in 2017 and the relaunch of its American Bar in 2018. 
“Norma will be a great addition to the already strong restaurant offering at The Stafford and we are looking forward to bringing the exceptional levels of service for which we are already known, to a brand-new concept and location,” added The Stafford London’s general manager, Stuart Procter.
Norma is due to open this summer.

db heads to Atul Kochhar’s new restaurant Kanishka, which promised to showcase cuisine from India’s lesser-known regions, and discovers plates of soft shell crab with peanut and mango chutney, steamed sea bass and a ‘cheeky’ peanut butter and salted caramel parfait adorned with gold leaf.
Kanishka in Mayfair
The concept: From chef Atul Kochhar comes Kanishka, which opened in March on Maddox Street in Mayfair. Kochhar made a name for himself while working at Tamarind in Mayfair, which won a Michelin star in 2001. He left to open Benares in 2002, which was awarded its own Michelin star four years later. The new restaurant aims to showcase cuisine from India’s lesser-known regions and is a joint partnership between Kochhar and Tina English, another recognised innovator of London’s Indian dining scene, having previously worked as commercial director for Indian Restaurants Limited to develop The Cinnamon restaurant brand. The restaurant itself is named after King Kanishka, an emperor of the Kushan dynasty in the second century, who practised the Buddhist values of including kindness, fairness, honesty, humbleness and a sense of equality.
The decor: Pushing open the antique front doors, guests are greeted to Kanishka by a pair of topiary elephants, setting the tone for Kochhar’s tropical, modern Indian outpost. Kitted out like a candy-striped mint humbug, Kanishka’s art deco-inspired main dining room is tasteful, yet playful, and not in the least bit tacky, despite the aforementioned humbug comparison. It’s really very pretty, adorned with green foliage, mirrors and intricate beading throughout. Split across the ground and basement floors, the 127-cover space includes a statuesque central bar to the front, offering a spot to enjoy a pared down evening of drinks and bar snacks. A ‘small terrace’ (perhaps more accurately described as a smoker’s refuge) sits to the front, which I’m sure will come into its own in the summer, while an intimate, 12-cover garden room awaits at basement level. 

Seafood Alleppey Curry
The food: Given Kochhar’s prior specialisms, it’s no surprise that he should have chosen Indian as the cuisine for his next venture. But it’s not an easy cuisine to reinvent. Rather than replicate what he achieved at Tamarind and Benares, with Kanishka Kochhar hopes to open diners eyes to “previously unexplored” areas of Indian cuisine, including the Seven Sister States in the most easternmost region of India – namely Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura and Mizoram. It is Indian fine dining, but with a street-food twist, introducing influences from rural India and airlifting them into the heart of urban Mayfair.
The menu is familiar, with Atul’s chicken tikka pie served with a cumin-scented berry compote, likely to entice traditionalists, in the Anglo-Indian sense, but there are also many more ambitious dishes to demonstrate Kochhar’s flair and experimental approach to modern Indian cuisine. Salting, smoking and fermenting, made necessary by the remoteness of the regions that his menu is inspired by, are common, as are the use of ingredients like soya, raw meat, dumplings and noodles, drawing upon the influence of bordering countries such as Nepal, China, and Bangladesh.
Signature starters include Gangtok momos filled with Kentish lamb and served with fermented vegetable chutney and Tibetan guinea fowl thupka, a classic North-eastern noodle and meat soup with coriander and green onion. A rather tempting Sikkim-inspired venison tartare with mustard oil mayonnaise, naan crouton and onions also caught my eye, although I can’t vouch for execution.
Angoori Hing Aloo – a spiced potato salad tossed with grapes and pomegranate
Seafood also plays a starring role, over which Kochhar wields a necessarily firm hand when it comes to spice. None of the dishes we sampled were overpowering in this department, with intensity of flavour, rather than unnecessary heat, instead shining through.
The soft shell crab with mango and peanut jhal muri (a street food from the Bengal region made from puffed rice and an assortment of spices) and passion fruit chutney (£17), for example, was a treat for the senses. A melt-in-the mouth crisped crab drizzled in burnt lime brought the delicate spices to life. A plate of Zutto fish and oysters arrived deep fried in a light rice beer batter, oysters in their shells, served with fermented tamarind ketchup (£15). A winning combination.
Mains include the signature Seafood Alleppey Curry (£28), a dish of pan seared seafood and coconut and turmeric sauce, which has emerged as one of the restaurant’s most visually striking dishes. Presented atop a bright orange spiced emulsion, it delivered on flavour and execution. I only wish it had looked more like the photo used to entice curious diners through the doors. On our visit, at least, it seemed to be lacking the puffed up statement langoustine, which was instead languishing low, which left the dish looking a little flat. A menagerie of razor clams, scallops and squid withstanding, garnished with coconut shavings, its remnants were nevertheless feverishly mopped up with a puffed naan or two.
The highlight was a banana leaf steamed seabass sorrel chutney with pineapple and shrimp kutchumber (£28) – the latter being a salad dish made with fresh chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, lemon juice and chilli. Cooked to perfection, the flaky fish was a delight to devour.
A bread basket (£10) amounted to five assorted naans stacked high, more than enough for four to share, alongside a simple bowl of rice (£4). A side of the exotic-sounding Angoori Hing Aloo (£8) was enough to draw our interest, and turned out to be one of the most flavoursome dishes of the night – a spiced potato salad tossed with grapes and pomegranate, which offered a tempered punch of spice.
Perhaps mimicking Heston Blumenthal’s famed meat fruit, in reverse, dessert came in the form of a salty-sweet, silky peanut butter chikki parfait with salted caramel and caramelised banana, coated in 24 carat gold leaf, (£8.50) which could have passed for a rather glam chicken liver pate. It was divine.
Atul’s Passion Fruit Martini
The drinks: The wine list at Kanishka starts from a very reasonable £6.50 a glass, with a healthy by-the glass offer featuring a variety of crowd pleasers, from the Ana Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc (£10.50), (which paired beautifully with our spiced seafood selections), to Charle’s Smith’s Kung Fu Girl Riesling, from Washington. Sparkling wines come courtesy of the likes of Ridgeview and Taittinger, by the glass. Krug and Louias Roederer feature by the bottle, at upwards of £300.
By the bottle the list is more extensive, thought not huge. It’s a well-formed, concise list with helpful tasting notes alongside each wine, a simple yet often forfeited feature of a wine list.
Signature cocktails include the Roast Banana Old Fashioned (£8.50), made from Tandoor roasted banana with cinnamon, orange and pecan bitters, maple, and the more savoury Ingrita (£8.50), made from Mezcal served with a chilled lightly spiced tomato broth.
‘Kanishka’s World of Imagination’ meanwhile will allow diners to create their own highball drink from a menu of herb and spice distillates, mixed with a choice of naturally flavoured tonic waters and their spirit of choice. The bar is also stocked with more than 50 expressions of whisky, including a unique selection sourced from India.
Last word: Kanishka is not cheap, although if choosing to dine in the heart of London’s Mayfair, one would expect not. The question is, does Kochhar’s cuisine justify its price? After some deliberation, admittedly, I came down firmly on the side of yes. It won’t suit all wallets, but it offers a menu that doesn’t shy away from doing something new, has embraced its Mayfair locale with gusto, and offers the adventurous diner something different in London’s increasingly saturated restaurant jungle, where only the toughest survive.
Our a la carte meal was a little shy over £200, for three courses including sides, and a restrained drinks order. But you don’t have to go all in to get a taste of Kochhar’s cuisine, Kanishka offers a very reasonable two course set menu for £24, or three courses for £29 three, at lunch (12pm – 14.30pm, Monday–Saturday) and dinner (between 17.30pm–18.30pm and 21.30pm onwards, Monday–Sunday).
While early days, one senses that Kochhar could be priming his new enterprise to be his next Michelin conquest. The potential to reach such heights is certainly there, threaded throughout Kochhar’s innovative and ambitious menu, executed with the necessary enthusiasm and panache. It delivers on quality and style, and carries a certain sense of grandiosity that is befitting of a star. Who knows, perhaps a hat trick is on the horizon. But that shouldn’t be the sole aim. Kanishka still has room for improvement, but marks a triumphant return to London’s dining scene for Kochhar – a past, and now current, master of Indian fine dining.

Californian producers Lede Family Wines has entered into a “joint partnership” with one of Priorat’s leading producers Mas Doix it has been announced.
Owned by brothers Ramón and Valentí Llagostera, the Spanish winery was founded in 1998 in the village of Poboleda in the northern part of Priorat.
They produce wines using the region’s traditional grapes, Grenache and Carignan, with some vineyards they farm being 100 years-old.
Lede Family Wines’ primary estate meanwhile, Cliff Lede Winery, is located in the Stags Leap district of Napa Valley.
Canadian founder Cliff Lede then also acquired the Savoy Vineyard in Anderson Valley in 2011.
Lede commented: “As a company, we made a decision to explore opportunities outside of California.
“After the first meeting with Ramón and Valentí, I knew we shared the same values and philosophy on family, wine and business. It just felt right.”
The Llangostera brothers added: “On the eve of our 20th anniversary of Mas Doix, we thought it may be time to engage a partner for the next chapter. Our wines and complementary interests connected us but it was our core ideals and common vision for the future that made the Lede family the right partner.”
Lede Family Wines has been approached for further comment.

Initial figures released by a Chinese research firm showed that China’s wine imports suffered further drops in both volume and value in the first two months of 2019, signalling a challenging year ahead.

The data released by ASKCI, a Shenzhen-based Chinese research firm, showed that the country’s wine imports suffered a year-on-year decline of 13% in volume to 118 million litres in January and February, two months that is normally believed to be a brisk spending season for Chinese New Year.
Import value during the period dropped by 10% to US$6.04 million compared with the same period last year.
Reeling from a lacklustre 2018, which saw China’s overall import volumes drop by 8.95% and value levelling with a 1.1% increase, China’s wine market in 2019 is unlikely to see significant growth, a shared feeling among wine importers.
Slowing economy and ongoing trade war are expected to continue to affect market sentiment and consumer spending in the coming year.
ASC Fine Wines, the leading wine importer in Greater China, has set a “conservative” target for the year.

Ailsa Bay, WG&S’s premium Scotch whisky brand, has partnered with blockchain tech company arc-net to release a range of whiskies that “capture the full distilling and manufacturing process, allowing customers to track their whisky from source to store; ensuring authenticity and traceability.”
Ailsa Bay undergoes micro-maturation in small Hudson whiskey casks. The distillery collects data from parent company William Grant & Sons’ existing data sources, including cask types, filling dates and bottling dates are all tracked, which allows consumers to trace the individual components of the whisky and safeguard against fakes.
A blockchain is a list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash (or digital fingerprint) of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, blockchains are resistant to modification, making them a useful way for manufacturers to provide certification for their products.
The blockchain technology also allows Ailsa Bay to gather data from existing and potential customers, using mobile location services to correlate where the whisky is being purchased.
Just under £220 million is lost from the UK economy each year thanks to counterfeit wines and spirits entering the market, according to a recent report from the European Union’s Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). At the end of 2016, fake Scotch whisky bottles worth close to a total £1 million were removed from the market in what one broker called “just the tip of the iceberg”.
A number of companies within the drinks industry are toying with blockchain in an effort to crack down on counterfeiting. Everledger, a London-based technology company that uses blockchain technology to track the provenance of diamonds and other valuable products, announced a partnership with labelling and adhesive specialist Avery Dennison in January, to create wine labels with digital traceability.

ASC Fine Wines, the leading wine importer in Greater China, has reported double-digit growth for the year of 2018 amid weakening economy and ongoing China-US trade war, its company CEO has revealed in Chengdu, while admitting replicating such growth for 2019 is “impossible”.
Despite China’s economic troubles at present, ASC Fine Wines posted strong growth in 2018 with a double-digit growth in value, Yoshi Shibuya, company CEO, announced at a press briefing in Chengdu during Chengdu wine fair last week, though exact details were not revealed.
The growth is in sharp contrast to China’s tepid wine import performance in 2018. China’s weakening economy in 2018, the worst since 1990, and depreciated RMB coupled with uncertainties of the trade dispute with the US have adversely affected different sectors of the country’s manufacturing, exporting and importing businesses including wine.
For the first time since 2014 when the anti-corruption drive was taking a toll on extravagant spending, the country’s wine import volume dipped by 8.95% during the year, while value levelled out with 1.1% increase, as shown by customs figures.
Meanwhile, the profit margins for ASC Fine Wines and other importers operating in China, was further squeezed by the weakening Chinese currency.
According to Shibuya’s estimates, wine importers in China last year suffered roughly a 7% drop in profit margin against the US dollar, and 3% against the euro on average, calculated by comparing exchange rates in January against the highest in 2018.
Speaking of growth target for 2019, which according to the company CEO is more “reserved” and “conservative”, he admitted, “I don’t expect the company will keep making double-digit growth. No, it’s impossible.”
“That’s why, as I said, I made more efforts for long term improvement and stablisation regarding how we can sustain our business without achieving huge targets,” he continued, referring to measures to improve portfolio refinement and diversification, as well as employee development.
Describing 2018 as, “a year of turbulence for wine importers”, Shibuya said, aside from reasons related to economy and trade war, an influx of OEM wines, referring to cheap imported wines slapped with flashy labels, is also disrupting the market.
In 2018, an estimated 3,800 importers entered China’s wine market, bringing the total to 7,200, the majority of which “latched on [to the industry] to launch OEM, with easy name, easy label and cheap price. Traditional distributors like ASC are always disturbed by them,” he lamented.
However, he continued, despite the influx of OEMs, customs figures are showing an increase in import prices, meaning that consumers and professional wine merchants are slowly shunning cheap and low quality wines, and the market is undergoing what he calls “an adjustment for future growth”.
“The market is slowing down, and it’s part of the reason for the decrease but I like to see it as adjustment for further growth for the China market,” he commented. “So as I explained the market volume decreased but value is still keeping level, that means the price range is going up. But in the market prices are going down. That means consumers and trade people want to take a break from new OEMs. People are getting tired, and the trade is maturing.”
In order to introduce more quality and artisanal wine brands to the market, this year, the wine importer has added four brands from France to its portfolio, Provence rosé Miraval and three other Burgundian estates to diversify its offerings.
Meanwhile for spirits, starting from this year, ASC Fine Wines will be distributing Beam Suntory in mainland China.

Rural pubs in the UK are set to receive extra funding to enable them to run additional services including Post Office facilities, shops and libraries, as part of a bid to increase their community value and prevent further closures.
A total of 76 pubs will receive a share of £188,000 in funding to provide additional services to their communities beyond food and drink.
The UK Government announced yesterday that 76 pub across England are to receive share of £188,000 in funding through Pub is The Hub – an organisation that help rural pubs to diversify their offer an bring communities together by expanding their services beyond food and drink.
Projects planned include additional Post Office facilities within existing pubs, shops, libraries and children’s play areas.
“This funding will be welcomed by many projects and will be a huge boost for thousands of people living in, and visiting, rural communities,” said John Longden, chief executive of Pub is The Hub.
“Services and activities delivered by professional pub licensees (landlords) through their businesses can provide a wide range of benefits; basic groceries, library books, training courses, outlets for local suppliers and new jobs – all delivering improved levels of well-being through vital social connections.”
Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, also welcomed the additional funding.
“As the original social network, pubs are at the heart of our communities and play a vital role in our lives by bringing us together.
“The pub is far more than just a place to eat and drink. The work of Pub is the Hub with funding and expert support shows how vital pubs can be to delivering other services of community value from Post Office facilities to grocery shops and libraries.
“This additional Pub is the Hub funding will boost rural, community pubs across the UK, helping them remain viable. Pub is the Hub is a great charity which everyone in brewing and pubs supports. This additional funding will encourage others to support it too.”
PUBS STILL CLOSING
While the funding is aimed at tackling rural isolation, it comes at a time when UK pubs are still closing at a rate of 14 per week, according to the Campaign for Real Ale, which has prompted the organisation to renew calls for action from the Government to support pubs and prevent their permanent loss to communities.
The number of pub closures has dropped slightly from a rate of 18 a week last year, thanks in part to CAMRA’s success in achieving new local planning protection for pubs in England, but remains high at 14 a week.
Four years ago, the rate was much higher at a rate of 29 per week in 2014. Since then, a number of initiatives have been launched by CAMRA alongside MPs to ease the rate of decline in the on-trade.
As part of the 2018 Budget announcement, the government announced a third off eligible retailer’s business rates bills for two years from April 2019 for properties with a rateable value below £51,000, which it said is worth an estimated £1 billion and will help community pubs to thrive.
“Our pubs are at the heart of local communities supporting thousands of jobs and providing places for local residents to not only enjoy a pint, but also to get together,” said Community Pubs Minister Jake Berry MP.
“The encouragement, advice and support given by the Pub is The Hub is proving invaluable in helping rural pubs expand their offer. Pubs are not only places to drink but also home to essential community services and providing welcome meeting places to help tackle rural isolation.”
A total of 76 projects will benefit from funding, listed here.

At an awards ceremony last week, French gastronomic society Chaîne de Rotisseurs crowned the best young chef and sommelier of the year, as well as handing out the first Gerard Basset Tasting Trophy in honour of the late Master Sommelier and former member of the group.
The top young sommeliers in Great Britain. L-R: Matteo Montone, Salvatore Castano and Paul Robineau
Held at The Dorchester Hotel last Friday (22 March), The Chaîne de Rotisseurs GB toasted their new young chef of the year and young sommelier of the year. Open to sommeliers aged between 21 and 30 and chefs between 20 and 27 the finals took place in London and Leatherhead in Surrey respectively.
The inaugural Gerard Basset Tasting Trophy was also awarded during the evening, going to the competitor who had scored the highest marks in the blind tasting and food matching elements of the finals, considered to be those that were closest to Basset’s heart.
Italian born Matteo Montone, 30, currently the wine director at the London Edition Hotel was crowned the young sommelier of the year. Inspired to become a sommelier after a stint working at Locanda Locatelli, Montone has also chalked up stints at The Shard and The Ritz.
Commenting on his achievement, he said: “This is a great honour and I am excited and proud to win. The competition was very close, but all that hard work paid off. I have an understanding wife, Eloisa, who put up with those long hours of extra studying! I would like to thank her, and the team at Edition, for all their help and encouragement to get me here today. Now I want to start on my Master Sommelier qualification.”

With just a few points between them, Salvatore Castano, head sommelier at London’s Mash came second, with Paul Robineau of Moor Hall, Lancashire taking third.
Judges this year included Isa Bal MS, Nigel Wilkinson MS, Stefan Neumann MS, Steven Spurrier and Christelle Guibert – alongside Philip Evins, bailli délégué for the Chaîne des Rôtisseurs.
Commenting on the result, Evins said: “The contest is not only about skills and knowledge but is also about the passion and ability to present to guests – or in this case – our judges!
“This is currently Britain’s only competition for young sommeliers and the increasing numbers of individuals taking part, indicates the role of sommelier is appreciated by many diners. It takes a few years to reach the standard of a winner, but it is hugely encouraging to see the skillsets improve year on year.”
The award for best young chef went to Jordon Powell, 20, from Sussex, who currently works as chef de partie at South Lodge Hotel in Horsham.
Commenting on his achievement, Powell said: “This is a fantastic result as I was up against very stiff competition. But chef contests have always been an important part in my career. I love them, and am very excited to be going to Canada in September, to represent Great Britain. It won’t be a holiday, so I intend to take every opportunity offered between now and then to learn and train. I am very grateful for the support and encouragement of not only South Lodge’s Head Chef Lewis Hamblet, but also my Westminster College tutor Chris Basten.”
Powell and Montone will go on to represent Great Britain in the World Championships this September, held in Calgary in Canada for the chefs and in Seoul, South Korea for the sommeliers.
In a moving ceremony and tribute to the late Gerard Basset, Frenchman Paul Flauvel, 29, head sommelier at The Lanesborough was awarded the inaugural Gerard Basset Tasting Trophy. The award was presented by Gerard’s widow, Nina, and their son Romané.
Nina said: “Gerard always loved blind tastings. In fact it was his favourite part of any competition. I know he would have been very proud of this choice. It is so fitting to have a tasting trophy like this in his name.”
Philip Evins added: “Gerard was not only a good friend to us all, but also an enthusiastic contributor to the Chaine, helping us to create the GB competition back in 2008. He remained chair of the judges until this year, and we have so much to thank him for. Gerard was life-enhancing, and a wonderful mentor of young people, encouraging them in their careers.”
Commenting on Fauvel’s performance, judge Steven Spurrier said: “This candidate was astonishing. He didn’t falter, but calmly, logically and correctly identified all the wines – several of which not even the judges had tried before.”
Flauvel who hails from Normandy, first honed his skills in Bordeaux before travelling around Australia, New Zealand and Dublin and arriving in London three years ago.
Commenting on his achievements, he said: “I am very honoured to win this trophy, awarded for the first time. I only met Gerard Basset once, and it was brief. But the memory has stayed with me, and he has been such an inspiration to young sommeliers like me.”
The sommelier exam consisted of 123 short answer questions covering wine, wine service and spirits. This was followed by a blind wine tasting test, featuring six different wines from classic grape varieties that were assessed in order to established vintage, grape variety, country and appellation. The sommeliers were then given six spirits to identity. Somms were also tested on their decanting, Champagne service, food and wine pairing, general knowledge and serving skills. In addition, they were given a wine list with mistakes in it to correct.

The rum industry has welcomed a post-Brexit trade deal signed between the UK and the Caribbean which will allow businesses to continue trading without additional barriers or tariffs.," 26th March, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/03/rum-industry-welcomes-uk-and-caribbean-post-brexit-trade-deal/,"26th March, 2019

The rum industry has welcomed a post-Brexit trade deal signed between the UK and the Caribbean which will allow businesses to continue trading without additional barriers or tariffs.

Businesses in the UK and consumers are set to benefit from the trade continuity agreement which will be enforced with the Caribbean after the UK leaves the EU.
The Cariforum-UK Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) was signed on Friday 22 March by UK trade policy minister George Hollingbery and ministers and representatives from Barbados, Belize, The Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, The Republic of Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
The agreement has been welcomed by the West Indies Rum and Spirits Producers Association (WIRSPA) which represents brands such as Appleton, Angostura and Mount Gay Rum.
There will be no tariffs placed on all goods imported into the UK from those states that have signed the deal. Caribbean states will also continue to gradually cut import tariffs on most of the region’s imports from the UK.
As well as rum, the UK is a key market for bananas and sugar cane. In 2017 it bought 100% of Saint Lucia’s banana exports, as well as 69% of Belize’s banana exports, and 81% and 64% respectively of Guyanan and Jamaican sugar cane exports. In 2017, the total trade between the UK and the Caribbean was worth around £2.5 billion.
Minister for trade policy, George Hollingbery said: “I am delighted to sign this agreement today as it will allow businesses to continue trading like they do today after we leave the European Union.
“It will help to support jobs in the UK and throughout the Caribbean, as well as ensuring that the British supermarkets shelves continue to be stocked with the best Caribbean produce such as bananas, sugar and rum.
“We have a long-standing commitment to reduce poverty through trade and this agreement will support jobs in key Commonwealth countries, such as Saint Lucia, Belize, Grenada, Dominica, Barbados and Guyana for whom the UK currently accounts for more than a quarter of their trade in goods with the EU.”
Komal Samaroo, chairman of the West Indies Rum & Spirits Producers Association (WIRSPA), and head of the Guyana-based Demerara Distillers conglomerate said: “We’re extremely happy to see the culmination of this agreement which both sides have worked hard to achieve. The UK is a major export destination for our rums and we are pleased that the trade provisions will maintain our continued access to that market.
“The rum industry is the region’s premier export industry and its largest export earner after minerals, as well as a significant employer.
“The preferential provisions in the agreement will continue to give our authentic rum producers a much-needed boost vis-à-vis subsidised products from other countries.”

Neil McGuigan, the chief executive of wine producer Australian Vintage, has prepared for “every eventuality” in the coming weeks.

AV, which owns brands like McGuigan and Tempus Two, is as “ready as can be” when it comes for planing for the UK’s divorce from the EU. The company has boosted its stock levels in the UK to account for up to three weeks’ worth of delayed shipments, chief operating officer Julian Dyer told the drinks business, adding that, while the company’s footprint is predominantly in the UK, AV is “ready to push the button on our EU presence in Dublin.”
Dyer said: “We’ve scenario planned every eventuality. Obviously Australia has an advantage over European countries. We know the process and we have considered a lot of options.”
Despite the company suffering a blow to its profits shortly after the Brexit vote, McGuigan told db that Dyer encouraged executives to double-down on their interests in the UK.
“When the Brexit vote came it cost us $5-1&0m in profit and $10m in cash flow thanks to the exchange rate. It really hurt us, but Julian said “mate we’ve got to continue to invest”.
McGuigan told db the company had ramped up its presence in the UK, launching its first marketing campaign last year, which he said had driven its sales footprint in the country.
AV’s profits rose by 79% in the year to 30 June 2018, with UK sales up by 18%. The UK and Europe made up around 44% of AV’s total revenue of $143 million, with the UK representing most of the $62.5 million in sales.
The wine chief added that AV is “totally committed to this market place.”
UK taxation
Dyer told db that, although a break from the EU could create an opportunity for a new free trade deal with Australia, he added that the UK’s comparatively high duty on alcohol is still a cause for concern for many countries where wine production forms a large part of the economy.
While the UK’s departure from the customs union is “not good”, a greater concern for alcohol companies is the UK’s “hideous taxation”. Dyer pointed out that, since 2010, duty on wine has risen by 39% in the UK. Duty on wine rose 1 February 2019, while excise duties on spirits and beer were frozen by chancellor Philip Hammond in the 2018 Autumn Statement.
“We’ve taken the strategic view that we continue to invest but a lot of countries are saying ‘sod it.'”
“If the uk gov leaves eu and wants good FTAs then we will want an environment that is benign for our exports.”
New markets
Beyond Brexit, McGuigan also noted that the company is paying closer attention to Chinese exports. Wine exports into China rose 18% to $1.1 billion in the second half of 2018, according to AV’s latest results posted in February. “In the last 6 months our sales growth has actually been higher than the Australian sales growth,” McGuigan said.
McGuigan said the rate of annual wine consumption per capita in China is 1lr per head, compared with 45 litres per capita in Italy last year, according to statista.
The AV chief executive said that, although growth is strong, the market isn’t yet fully matured. “There is no wine drinking culture in China yet…we’re about a generation away.”
Fizz focus
Earlier this year, the company announced plans to spend AUS$11 million on a new state-of-the-art bottling facility in Victoria in order to “significantly increase” its production capabilities.
McGuigan told the drinks business that, as well as updating the company’s technology, the new facility will also have the capacity to produce sparkling wine.
“We are now able to bottle all our sparkling and carbonated wines through that system,” he said, adding that the company’s vinification tech allows AV to “adjust the size of the bubbles and texture that we get on the palate.”
The project is part of a larger $19 million investment to improve the company’s operations across all its sites. The other $8 million, McGuigan said, is being spent on a super-premium estate in Buronga Hill, New South Wales.

German pharmaceutical firm Farmako has filed a patent application for its process that uses genetically modified Tequila bacteria to produce cannabinoids from sugar, dramatically reducing the cost of producing substances such as THC.
The Frankfurt-based company has sent its application to the European Patent Office. It claims its production process could cut production costs of cannabinoids dramatically, saving the industry money and facilitating cheap, industrial-scale production.
It claims 1 kilogram of THC – a cannabinoid otherwise known as tetrahydrocannabinol – would cost around one thousandth less using its biosynthetic process.
Last month scientists at the University of California in Berkeley announced that they had developed a method of brewing genetically-modified cannabis using beer yeast, hailing a cheaper and more environmentally-friendly method of producing the cannabinoids for both medical and recreational applications.
Farmako states that its process does not use yeast cells, instead utilising a genetically modified form of Zymomonas mobilis bacteria, usually used in the production of Tequila. Farmako’s process claims to produce around 180 different cannabinoids including CBD and THC.
Co-founder of Farmako and chief science officer Patrick Schmitt said using the synthetic bacteria, rather than yeast, “was more economical”.
“With one production run, we can produce cannabinoids for 900 hours without interruption. For example, 4.5 kilograms of THC are produced per gram of bacterial mass during this time,” he said.
“In principle, nothing else happens during biosynthesis than during alcohol fermentation, with the difference that cannabinoids instead of alcohol are the outcome of the process. All we need as a starting point is glucose.”
Schmitt modified the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis by introducing genes from the malaria pathogen and the cannabis plant. Using gene scissors, he was able to remove certain genes which are usually responsible for alcohol production. The new gene-edited bacterium, which the company is calling Zymomonas cannabinoidis, is capable of producing cannabinoids from glucose.
Niklas Kouparanis, CEO and co-founder of Farmako, added: “Making any cannabinoid synthetically and incredibly efficient is the breakthrough for cannabis in medicine. Our patent will revolutionise the pharmaceutical industry in cannabis as much as the biosynthesis of insulin. The cannabis industry is therefore facing such rapid upheavals as, for example, the entertainment industry when Netflix became popular.
“As a research-based pharmaceutical company, we ensure that the many previously unknown possibilities of cannabinoids are finally empirically explored for the benefit of patients and put into practice. This patent application puts us in a unique position worldwide.”
Medical cannabis has been legal in Germany since 2017.
Last month, a report projected Cannabis drinks sales in the US would pass the US$1billion mark within four years. In October 2018, Canada legalised recreational cannabis, making it the second country after Uruguay, which passed legislation in 2013, to impose such a measure.
Among the drinks companies that have invested or are reported to be interested in the sector include Constellation Brands, Coca-Cola, Southern Glazer’s Wine and Spirits, Diageo, Molson Coors and Heineken.

A new report has shed some light on how much cash UK drinkers are willing to part with for a low-ABV cocktail at the bar.

Monin’s trend report, which includes ideas for driving footfall, increasing dwell time and enhancing the overall customer experience, outlined the rough amount of money UK drinkers are willing to part with when they go out.
The syrup producer surveyed more than 1,000 consumers around the UK to get a clearer picture of how the country’s on-trade drinks habits have changed over the past 12 months.
The report features regional differences to help outlets get it right in their specific geographical location.
“By identifying the wants, needs and desires of consumers and compiling them in a tangible reference guide, we hope to give establishments the insight they need to create a menu that hits the right spot with their customers,” said Lee Hyde, Monin’s beverage innovation manager.
The average amount Brits across the country would spend on a cocktail in a bar is £5.78. Londoners, perhaps unsurprisingly, were willing to spend more with an average rate of £7.15.
According to the survey, one third of drinkers are willing to spend up to £6 on a non-alcoholic cocktail. Overall, 40% of people said they would spend over £4, with some willing to pay more than £10 for a low-ABV drink.
However, the majority of people said they would expect to pay just up to £3 for a sober serve.
Those aged 18-24 were willing to spend £1.56 more on a low ABV serve compared to drinkers over 55.
Low ABV drinks as a whole are becoming more popular. Sales of non-alcoholic beer rose by almost 60% in the 12 weeks to 12 August, according to figures from Kantar Worldpanel, while an earlier report noticed a dramatic rise in the sales of low-ABV spirits.
This year, Diageo-owned gin brand Gordons is set to launch two flavoured, low-alcohol gin and tonics in bars and pubs, after the initial release of the pre-mixed drinks at supermarkets in June.
The rise in low alcohol beverage sales comes at a time when more consumers, particularly young people are attempting to go sober. A recent study by the Portman Group found that 24 % of British drinkers are keen to cut back on booze, rising to nearly a third (31%) for the 18-24 year old bracket, dubbed ‘Generation Sensible’.
Speaking at the launch of a report on the drinking habits of 18-24-year-olds by Red Brick Road and Opinium earlier this year, FT drinks editor Alice Lascelles said that bartenders now see it as a “badge of honour” to be able to create low ABV cocktails at the same level of quality as their alcoholic counterparts.
Johanna Gerhold, Google’s drinks industry head, added that, while many bars offer high prices for low ABV drinks, consumers are often actively looking for an option on par with others at the bar.
“They don’t want to be infantilised,” McConnell said. “They want to feel like they’re part of the same night out, just without the alcohol content.”

Saga Cruises and the Royal Navy have both chosen to christen their new vessels with English sparkling wine and not Champagne, with the former commissioning Kent producer Hush Heath to create its own-label fizz.
In a ceremony in Scotstoun, Glasgow on 21 March, Royal Warrant holder and Cornish wine producer Camel Valley was used to christen the Royal Navy’s new ship: HMS Tamar.
Commenting on the achievement, owner and founder of Camel Valley, Bob Lindo said: “It is a great honour to see a Cornish wine used for the naming of Tamar and we are delighted that Camel Valley ‘Cornwall’ Brut has been chosen as her affiliated bottle.
“I hope that Tamar sees many years of safe service with the Royal Navy and I look forward to us always playing a special part in the relationship between the ship, Truro and the rest of Cornwall.”

Meanwhile, Saga Cruises is also set to christen its new ship, the Spirit of Discovery, with a bottle of English fizz.
The British cruise line has teamed up with Kent-based Hush Heath to develop its dedicated own-label English sparkling wine that will be served on board.
The two companies have a longstanding relationship having worked together for many years. Called the Balfour Hush Heath Spirit of Discovery, the wine will be served alongside afternoon tea onboard the ship.
A Jeroboam of the fizz will also be used to christen the vessel in the Port of Dover on 5 July before it embarks on its maiden voyage around the British Isles on 10 July.
Saga Cruises’ chief operating officer, Nigel Blanks, said: “We are making history with our first new British cruise ship for the British market so it’s the perfect blend to christen Spirit of Discovery with her own beautiful sparkling wine.

“Spirit of Discovery is a luxury, boutique ship – everything is bespoke and that includes the English sparkling wine! Not only will this new blend be used to christen the ship – guests will be able to toast the ship again and again during their cruise!”
“Saga is very proud of its Kentish heritage. We have our headquarters in Folkestone and our first ship set sail from Dover over 20 years ago.
“We also source much of our fresh produce from the county and so the new Spirit of Discovery sparkling wine, made from grapes grown and picked in Kent, the Garden of England, is another exciting treat for our guests.”
Hush Heath Estate owner Richard Balfour-Lynn said he was ‘”delighted to create a sparkling wine to christen the new world-class ship”.
Hush Heath winemaker, Owen Elias, added: “We wanted to produce a bespoke wine to mark such a wonderful occasion. It is a delicious sweeter wine with balanced acidity and a delicate mousse.”

US trade body the Brewers Association has published a list of the country’s craft breweries that are becoming popular, fast.

Representing 27 states across the U.S., the breweries experienced average (median) growth of 163% in 2018. Those on the list range from 50 barrels to more than 40,000, and grew from less than 70,000 barrels collectively in 2017 to more than 170,000 barrels in 2018.
Lake Time Brewery in Iowa topped the list in this year’s report, brewing a range of styles and innovate flavours including a peanut butter stout, and funfetti cream ale. It was followed by Fins Big Oyster Brewery in Delaware, which launched in 2015 and expanded a year later into a new brewing facility which also features a barrel ageing room and a 40-seat restaurant.
“Even as market competition continues to increase, these small and independent breweries and brewpubs demonstrate there are still growth opportunities across a diverse set of regions and business models,” said Bart Watson, chief economist, Brewers Association.
The ranking includes only small and independent breweries, which represent around 10% of total craft growth by volume for the year, and include 13 brewpubs, 35 microbreweries, and two regional craft breweries.
Growth is measured based on production at their own facilities. Breweries must have opened by December 31, 2016 or earlier to be considered.
The BA also published a list of the country’s most lucrative craft breweries earlier this month, all of which adhere to the industry body’s guidelines on business size and values.

DEFINITION OF CRAFT
The BA’s definition of craft covers those brewers deemed to be “small, independent and traditional”.
Small means that the brewer has an annual production of six million barrels of beer or less, “flavoured malt beverages are not considered beer for purposes of this definition”.The association describes an American craft brewer as “small, independent and traditional”.
Independent means that “less than 25% of the craft brewery is owned or controlled by an alcoholic beverage industry member who is not themselves a craft brewer”.
Traditional relates to “a brewer who has either an all malt flagship (the beer which represents the greatest volume among that brewers brands) or has at least 50% of its volume in either all malt beers or in beers which use adjuncts to enhance rather than lighten flavour.”

The days of highly extracted Pinot Noirs and overworked ferments in Central Otago are a thing of the past according to one key winery owner in the region.," 29th March, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/03/era-of-extraction-is-over-in-central-otago/,"29th March, 2019

The days of highly extracted Pinot Noirs and overworked ferments in Central Otago are a thing of the past according to one key winery owner in the region.
David Hall-Jones, co-owner of Domaine Thomson, believes the era of extraction is over in Central Otago
Speaking exclusively to db, David Hall-Jones, co-owner of Domaine Thomson, said: “Winemaking styles and techniques in Central Otago have come a long way in the last 20 years.
“The era of extraction, overworking ferments and striving to be like the Old World has passed. We are now moving in a new direction and are making more hands off, minimal intervention, structured wines that really showcase Central Otago. Our Pinot Noirs are all the better for this ongoing evolution and the future looks very bright for our region,” he said.
Central Otago’s knockout beauty is leading to loyal wine fans
But while the future may be bright, it won’t be without it challenges, the biggest of which, Hall-Jones believes, will be the need for more machine harvesting.
“As labour costs increase and accommodation for vineyard workers remains scarce, we may see the need for more mechanisation in Otago vineyards in the future.
“Well engineered machinery will potentially help to achieve the same quality level as humans at harvest, but it’s a dilemma as I love seeing people among our vines
“Our vineyard resembles the United Nations at harvest, with dozens of nationalities helping us, including Europeans, Asians, Pacific Islanders and South Americans.
“These are young people who enjoy working in the vineyards in our province. A big part of me wants to see the human element remaining as an integral part of our vineyard life,” Hall-Jones told db.
As to whether we are likely to see more high profile sale of small Central Otago wineries to big players, Hall-Jones believes the region has become hot property. “There is ongoing pressure on some smaller owner-operator vineyards who find it difficult to bear the cost of marketing their wines in a competitive market place.
Autumn colours in Central Otago
“Making and selling wine in this region, where volumes need to be relatively low to protect wine quality, is a challenge and scale is certainly a plus.
“I think we’ll see larger companies snapping up some really fine smaller vineyards over time. Many of the big players, both national and international, want to add Central Otago Pinot Noirs to their portfolios, and I see this trend continuing,” he said.
Hall-Jones also revealed that winemakers looking to snap up the remaining suitable spots left for planting in Central Otago will have to compete with cherry growers, as the cherry industry there is booming.
“However, climate change may see some slightly cooler, less desirable areas becoming more suitable for planting. Wines from such regions may pass muster in a good year but I fear for some of these sites in cooler years,” he said.
Hall-Jones believes Central Otago is turning tourists into loyal Pinot lovers due to its knockout landscapes that burn bright in the memory.
“Central Otago is a remarkably beautiful place and tourism is booming. Visitors to the region inevitably have that eureka moment when they drink an Otago Pinot Noir while looking out at a stunning lake or alpine view.
“These wine lovers leave Central Otago with special moments etched in their memories, which means that people who come to our region tend to be loyal and long-term drinkers of our wines,” he said.

2011: Allotted the tough act of following the record breaking 2009 and 2010 vintages – things did not go well.
SICHEL: BORDEAUX 2011 “MESSY AND BLOODY”
Charles Sichel, export director of Maison Sichel, has branded aspects of the 2011 en primeurs “messy, bloody and very difficult”.
Speaking to the drinks business, Sichel blamed bad strategy on the part of the châteaux and complete lack of interest from buyers – regardless of price – for the disappointing campaign.
He said that the uneven pace of the releases had caused “exasperation” in both Bordeaux and abroad, particularly the rush last week on what became known as either “Super” or “Black” Tuesday, which he dubbed “quite ridiculous”.
“Timing needs to be more even to give everyone a bit of breathing space,” he added, “and in a vintage like 2011 every château needs time for the merchants to present them to their clients.
“That’s why we released Angludet first. It gave us a 10 day head start and the merchants had all that time to sell our wine. Then Lafite came out but nothing happened and even (Robert) Parker’s scores came out and still nothing happened. Then they all came out at once.
“It was a big mistake on the part of the owners. It caused massive congestion, which meant that a lot of wine which could have been sold went by the wayside.”
This is a point of view echoed by merchants that db spoke to recently.
However, while the châteaux have clearly misjudged the market, Sichel also thought that in many ways it is of little consequence as it is becoming increasingly clear that almost no appetite for 2011 exists at all among buyers.
“After three good campaigns (2008, 2009 and 2010) it is clear that that level of activity is absolutely not sustainable,” he continued.
“Prices have come down by up to 50% in places and it still has not been enough to interest the market.
“I think whatever the prices the market simply wasn’t there.”
What this means for the future is clear to Sichel although he rejects the notion that en primeur is somehow finished.
“It’s just one of those campaigns. En primeur is not broken, it’s cyclical. It’s been here before, although the level of activity in this campaign is at a record low that’s for sure.
“Bordeaux knows what needs to be done to get things back on track. Prices will likely have to come down again next year, although this will be dependent on the state of the market and quality of the wine too of course.”
As the campaign limps towards the finish line, is this a message that will be taken on board?
Mouton Rothschild released this week at €360 p/b, the same price as fellow firsts Margaux and Haut-Brion. Merchants were very sceptical of Mouton finding any success in the market if it tried to emulate its peers and even with a 40% price drop, it remains £1,100 more expensive than its 2001 vintage and has “failed to spark interest” according to Liv-ex.
All eyes must now be on Latour.
MERCHANTS: 2011 CAMPAIGN ‘WORST IN RECENT MEMORY’
The Bordeaux 2011 campaign is the “worst in recent memory” thinks Berry Bros & Rudd’s fine wine buying director, Max Lalondrelle.


Château Lafite

Speaking to the drinks business in the wake of Tuesday’s glut he and other merchants complained that too many wines are overpriced, the market isn’t interested and the whole campaign is a missed opportunity.
Price and value – or the lack of it – have come to dominate this campaign. Mark Bedini of Fine+Rare dubbed it: “The most dismal en primeur campaign in our 19 year history”.
He told db: “There has been a lot of concern over pricing. The intentions have been right but there’s no discount for the buyer. There needs to be an incentive to buy and they’ve missed providing a clear incentive”.
This was a point of view echoed by Gary Boom, founder of Bordeaux Index, who stated that the, “prices have not been keen enough to attract any strong interest”.
Timing has also played its part. Boom added: “Timing has not been great, it’s taken too long and then too much came out at once and everyone has lost interest.”
Corney & Barrow’s private sales associate director Will Hargrove, said that many, “savvy customers are looking back at comparable vintages and if prices are below 2011 then they buy those instead.”
After an incredibly early dash from the starting blocks from Lafite the campaign went very quiet and even once Parker’s scores were released nothing notable happened immediately.
Then on Tuesday 15 May, 43 wines came out practically on top of each other in what was dubbed “Super Tuesday”.
However, far from creating a “feeding frenzy”, said Hargrove, “it went a bit too far, a little bonkers”.
Lalondrelle candidly admitted that he has asked the négociants to remove him from their email lists and that “Super Tuesday” was yet another missed opportunity much like the campaign.
“Yesterday 43 wines released so there was a lot of missed turnover. We picked two and worked on them all day and so missed the opportunity to sell 41.
“I sent an email to the Bordeaux trade yesterday asking them to remove me from their mailing list. I had 2,500 emails in my inbox which is unmanageable.”
The word “apathetic” was used by all to describe buyers’ interest in the campaign.


A horse in the vineyard at Pontet-Canet. This fifth growth has sold well this year

Lalondrelle said that in 2009 BBR had made £115 million in sales, in 2010 a combination of price and quantity knocked it down to £65m and while a target of £30m was set for this year, “I’ll be happy if we make £15m,” he concluded.
2011 is clearly suffering from the years that preceded it. Boom said that 2009, while expensive, justified itself with “fantastic” wines, but “the 2010s were really not great (in price) and people were left nursing some losses and if it’s the same this year then en primeur has to be questioned.”
It seems as if critic Robert Parker’s prediction that the wines would “bomb” has come true.
The news was not all disaster, Hargrove said that: “Where people see value there has been some custom and if you’re looking at wines under £300 a case then a 20% drop is very fair”.
Meanwhile, Pontet Canet, Calon Ségur, Lafite, Margaux and Montrose were all picked out as selling well or being a good buy and Boom even said that Bordeaux Index had sold more Lafite and Margaux than it had last year, while Bedini also said that the first growths were selling well, though without the “razmatazz” of previous years.
Interestingly Boom refused to comment on Pontet Canet (praised by others), saying only that he had sold “20% of what we sold last year”.
The great tragedy is that, unanimously among the merchants, the vintage’s quality has been praised.
“Make no mistake these are beautiful, lovely wines,” said Boom, “but for whatever reason the US critics have not got behind it. We think the wines are much better than their Parker scores but we have to go on these scores with the customers”.
“Quality of the wines is not a problem,” agreed Lalondrelle. “There is a good market for classic vintages in the UK and this is a vintage we could have sold extremely well if the price was correct.”
What this means for next year’s en primeur campaign is interesting and thrown into sharper relief by Latour’s withdrawal next year.
Lalondrelle mooted that if next year’s campaign followed a similar course, “the whole system could be in jeopardy”.

Magic Rock, based in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, was founded in 2011 and has regularly been included in user comparison site Ratebeer’s Top 100 world brewers ranking.  It joins Lion’s growing portfolio of craft breweries, which also includes Panhead and Emerson’s in New Zealand, Australia’s Little World Beverages and, more recently, Fourpure in south London, which Lion acquired in July 2018.
Lion’s managing director Mark Tapper said the brewery is “one the pioneers in the UK craft beer scene and has built a loyal following due to its relentless pursuit of authenticity and quality.”
“Lion has a long and proud history in craft beer in Australia and New Zealand and we see some great opportunities to help put Magic Rock in the hands of more beer lovers.”
In a blog post on Magic Rock’s website, managing director Richard Burhouse said the decision to sell the company to the Kirin Holdings subsidiary is one the management team “haven’t taken lightly,” but added that he and other shareholders will stay on for at least another four years.
“It’s testament to Lion’s philosophy that in other breweries they’ve invested in, the founders (such as Chuck Hahn in Australia) are still involved many years later,” he said.
Production will stay at Magic Rock’s Huddersfield headquarters “for the long-term,” and said that the acquisition will enable the site’s expansion, paying for the rental of units close to the current base.
“There’ll also be improvements to our infrastructure including new offices, lab, quality control and sensory departments.”
Lion’s investment will also help Magic Rock to develop its reach both in the UK and globally.
“Of course, I realise that this news will not be universally well received but I’m also conscious that internationally renowned brewing companies don’t invest in Huddersfield every day, and I’m delighted that the journey we started eight years ago has got us to this point.”
Lion’s parent company is Japanese drinks giant Kirin Holdings, which as well as the Kirin Brewery Company and Kirin Beverage Company, also has a 55% stake in Myanmar Brewery Ltd, jointly owns San Miguel Brewery and has a 24.5% stake in Brooklyn Brewery.
Lion has already made a large investment this month, a 50% stake in fellow Australian gin brand Four Pillars.
The integrity of the craft beer movement is a hotly debated topic within the brewing industry, particularly as large-scale drinks producers are starting to take a greater interest in independent breweries and make acquisitions. Last summer, north London brewery Beavertown sold a 49% stake in its business to Heineken for £40 million, which would go towards a new state-of-the-art brewing facility as well as securing a brewpub at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, a first for any independent brewery. After announcing the deal, several bottle shops decided to stop selling Beavertown’s beers, while other breweries also pulled out of the London producer’s upcoming beer festival, Beavertown Extravaganza.
Previously independent brewers that have been sold to global drinks giants include Fuller’s, which was snapped up by Japanese giant Asahi in January, London Fields, which Carlsberg bought for £1m in 2017, and Lagunitas, which sold the remainder of its business to Heineken in May the same year.

Château de Cadillac-en-Fronsadais, the historic château linked to the first Baron of Cadillac, has been sold to a Chinese investor, Vineyards-Bordeaux has announced.
Château de Cadillac-en-Fronsadais, in Cadillac-en-Fronsadais AOC Bordeaux, has been sold to a Chinese businessman in the technology, media and telecommunication industry.
The buyer, identified only by his surname, Chen, was referred by Christie’s auction house in China, and purchased the estate along with stock from the Serisier family who acquired the property in 2004.
Château de Cadillac-en-Fronsadais has a storied history dating back to Pey de Montrevel, the first Baron of Cadillac, created by Edward II, King of England, in 1307, according to Vineyards-Bordeaux, an exclusive affiliate to Christie’s International Real Estate.
Chen will take over the stewardship of the estate and plans to continue the investment completed by the Serisiers since 2004.
Commenting on the purchase, the Chinese businessman, who works within the technology, media and telecommunication industry, said: “It is a dream come true for me to become a part of such a privileged history and participate in my passion for wine through such high quality terroirs.”
The sale joins a growing list of Chinese investors who have bought up vineyards and chateaux in Bordeaux.
By the end of 2018 about 150 Bordeaux estates, mostly in lesser-known appellations, had been bought by Chinese investors, including Jack Ma, founder of the Alibaba Group, Chinese actress Zhao Wei, and Hong Kong businessman Peter Kwok.
The growing number of Chinese investors in the region, however, has raised eyebrows from Bordeaux purists who argue that Chinese investors are changing century-old Bordeaux estate names into auspicious-sounding Chinese names bearing dragons, antelopes and rabbits, as dbHK previously reported.
The investment in the past has also raised fears of criminal activity. Earlier in June last year, police in France seized 10 wineries in the Bordeaux area that were owned by Chinese conglomerate Haichang over suspicions of tax fraud, forgery and laundering. The Dalian-based company spent an estimated US$64 million to acquire 24 estates in Bordeaux.
Despite increasing investment, the Chinese only own about 1.5% of Bordeaux’s 7,000-strong vineyards.

Over 1,000 bottles and large formats from the prestigious estate will go on sale in Geneva this 16 June at a sale hosted by Baghera Wines.
The domaine was founded 100 years ago in Vosne-Romanée by René Engel, a man who went on to train many of Burgundy’s great vignerons including Henri Jayer.
René’s son Pierre, who was twice elected mayor of Vosne-Romanée, succeeded his father in 1949 and after his death in 1981 the domaine passed to the hands of his son, Philippe – who also benefited from the input of his aged grandfather for a few years. By the early 1990s many would agree that Philippe really hit his stride with the wines and from 1992/93 onwards there was a distinct style and energy to them.
But in 2005 Philippe’s tragically early death aged just 49 saw the domaine pass into the hands of Château Latour’s owner François Pinault (his first Burgundian purchase) and renamed Domaine de Eugénie.
Had Philippe lived then there is no doubt that Domaine René Engel would today be one of Burgundy’s superstar names, uttered in the same breath as Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, Leroy, Armand Rousseau or Coche-Dury; though has the domaine seen the sort of posthumous demand ‘enjoyed’ by Philippe’s grandfather’s protégé, Henri Jayer.
As it is, they are wines held in great reverence by committed Burgundophiles and an array of this scope is more than many will have ever dreamed of
The sale will feature 1,156 bottles in total: 998 bottles, 146 magnums, 12 Jeroboams and one Methuselah in total, split into 168 lots which have all been sourced from the family’s cellar, consigned by Philippe’s brother and two sisters.
The wines on offer span the vintages 1921 to 2004 and cover five ‘climats’: Vosne-Romanée, Vosne-Romanée 1er cru Les Brulées, Grands-Echezeaux, Echezeaux and Clos Vougeot.
In all there are: 321 bottles and magnums of Vosne-Romanée from 1921-2004; 210 bottles, magnums and Jeroboams of Les Brulées from 1983 to 2004; 159 bottles and magnums of Echezeaux from 1922 to 2004; 307 bottles and magnums of Grands-Echezeaux from 1922 to 2004 and 160 bottles, magnums, Jeroboams and Methuselahs of Clos Vougeot from 1923 to 2004.
Top lots from the sale include:

A vertical of 16 magnums of Echezeaux from 1976-2003 (CHF20,000-50,000 – Swiss Franc prices are identical to the US dollar)
A 20-bottle vertical of Vosne-Romanée from 1976-2004 (CHF6,500-15,000)
A 12 bottle case of 2004 Grands-Echezeaux (CHF10,000-20,000)
A bottle of the 1923 Grands-Echezeaux (CHF2,500-5,000)
A four Jeroboam vertical of Clos Vougeot from 1999-2003 (CHF14,000-32,000)

This is the second big Burgundian coup that Baghera has pulled off in as many years.
Last year readers may recall that it sold the ‘last’ bottles from the cellar of the equally celebrated Henri Jayer as well, a sale which made CHF34.5m (£26.3m), still a record for a one-day wine sale.

The Liv-ex Fine Wine 100 index which tracks the most widely traded labels in the secondary market dipped again in March, having failed to register a positive monthly performance so far this year.
The benchmark index declined 0.2% last month, not as much as the 0.7% in February but meaning the index is back down at levels last seen in late 2017.
The best-performing labels in March included the 2015 Chateauneuf du Pape from Clos du Papes (up 7.6%), Domaine de la Romanée-Conti’s 2014 Richebourg, 2010 Leoville Poyferré, 2003 Montrose and 2007 Cristal.
It was another bad month for vintages ending in five though. Aside from the 2009 Petrus declining 5%, the 2015 vintages of Paul Jaboulet’s Hermitage La Chapelle, Domaine Leflaive’s Chevalier Montrachet and Beaucastel’s Chateauneuf all declined.
And Armand Rousseau’s 2015 Chambertin was by far the month’s biggest loser, down 17.3% from £31,107 per dozen to £25,721.
It is now the second month in a row that the 2015 Chambertin has been the month’s biggest faller, declining 8.5% last month.
That means it has fallen from £34,000 to £25,721 in the space of two months, a drop of 24%.

Vodka, once the all-powerful spirit suffered tepid demand in recent years following an overload of mass market flavoured concoctions and gimmicky brands. Piqued by interest for other white spirits such as craft gin and terroir-specific Tequila, however, well-crafted and premium vodkas are gaining a new lease of life among discerning drinkers. Results from our World Vodka Masters – Asia this year affirmed that bottles that celebrate vodka’s simplicity, purity and neutrality are indeed to be rewarded.

About a decade ago, vodka, the king of all white spirits, was ruling the cocktail scene, where its neutrality served as a canvas for mixologists’ creativity. In recent years, dismissed by critics as banal and one-dimensional, vodka seems to have retreated into the background. The white spirit’s ascendancy was then further sabotaged by mass marketed flavoured vodkas and gaudy packaging that helped with volume but lost it consumers who – as they matured – looked increasingly for sophisticated and well-crafted spirits.
Its waning appeal in comparison to gin and Tequila was felt among mixologists and bar owners in Asia as well. “Vodka lime sodas and vodka shots were very much in vogue about a decade back. While those are still mainstays on the nightclub circuit, with the rise of artisanal cocktail bars, consumers have moved towards gins and whiskies as their standard drink orders,” commented Victoria Chow, owner of Hong Kong’s cocktail bar The Woods and one of the judges for the competition.
Changing consumer preference 
If consumer preference is partly responsible for a shift from vodka, marketing gimmicks tied with the spirit did not help with vodka’s image either, thinks John Rhodes, owner of Jon Dory Limited, a Hong Kong-based spirits company, .
“The marketeers came up with gimmicks to sell essentially a grain alcohol but with flavours added or in a gimmicky bottle; that was all great for mass consumption but in terms of long-term image it wasn’t a good thing… That generation which jumped into the flavoured vodkas have moved on and the new generation of consumers want something a bit more honest and sophisticated,” he explained.
Continuing, he said: “The consumer is getting far more educated these days which in turn creates interest which in turn creates demand … for the right product.”
Indeed, the results from our inaugural World Vodka Masters – Asia confirm that bottles that are well crafted, balanced and faithful to their base products without stripping their flavours are what set the best vodkas apart.
Balance 
They key for a great vodka, be it distilled from potatoes, wheat, carrots or even grapes, as the judges agree, should have balance and flavour whether used as a mixer or drunk neat.
“Vodka really defines purity and simplicity when speaking in terms of spirits. It is the most neutral (it has always intended to be) and showcases the subtleties of the base ingredient. While Tequila is similar in the sense that it is an expression of its base material, gin is more of an expression of the distiller – who chooses the mix of botanicals to showcase,” Chow explained.
More importantly, as the judges observed the ones that truly stand out all have distinctive characteristics to tell where they are from and what they are made of, “a story” as they put it.
One such example was the Master-winning vodka, Masons Yorkshire, from the UK carrying a price tag of HK$360 in the Ultra-Premium Category. Finished at an alcohol strength of 42% abv, the spirit impressed all judges with its intensity of flavour, length of finish and its creamy mouthfeel. Praising the spirit, David Walters, head of Spirits Buying at Fine + Rare, said: “The mouthfeel was medium bodied and creamy. There was weight. Then there was balance, particularly the alcohol which was not marked and did not leave a burn. The finish was long and there was spice and a nutty character.”
Chow agreed, adding it goes down “supremely smoothly”. Another high performer was London-based distillery Bloomsbury’s peated vodka in the Smooth category. Distilled from peated barley, the spirit won a gold for its complexity with an extra layer of smokiness.
Another vodka that got the judges raving was an artisanal vodka distilled by New Zealand’s Spiritual Vodka in the Rest of the World category. Humming with energy and life, the vodka can peel back and reveal itself in subtle and complex layers of flavours, earning itself a Master.
Lauding the spirit, Rhodes enthused: “It had a story to tell. By that I mean when nosing the vodka, the flavours you get are different from when it is on the palate as well as producing long finish. The difference between nose and palate is what I am look for in any sipping alcohol and is one of the reasons why whisky, single malts in particular have made good rounds…that is what I mean by a drink having a story. A leaner flavour that goes from nose to palate is not that interesting unless the flavour is something special and the palate enhances what was on the nose.”
Eastern Europe
The stronghold of vodka undoubtedly is still in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia and those parts of the world were well represented in our competition by Sweden, Russia, Finland and Latvia.
Another top vodka from our tasting is Purity Vodka’s ‘Super 17 Premium’ made in Sweden, a wheat-based organic vodka. Impressing the judges with its complexity and balanced mouthfeel, the spirit went on to win a Master across a few categories such as Organic, Micro-distillery and Ultra-Premium. The boutique distillery’s Super 34 Premium was also awarded a gold.
In the Premium category, Finland’s Koskenkorva Vodka Original distilled from locally sourced barley took home a gold, while in the Standard category it was Latvia’s Moskovkaya Vodaka by Amber Beverage Group that emerged as a favourite among the judges for its clean nose and balanced palate.
Moving east to Russia, a country that has been inextricably linked to vodka, the excellence of its vodka production was well represented in this competition by Hiva Itar’s Tovaritch! Premium Vodka, winning a gold in the Organic, Smooth and Premium categories.
Of course, nothing excites the judges more than discovering hidden gems from lesser-known regions when their identities are revealed. Malaysia in Southeast Asia took home a gold medal in the Standard category with the Kharaso Vodka Original, a vodka triple distilled from sugarcane. 14 INKAS by Destilería Espíritu Andino and supported by the Innóvate Peru Program of the Ministry of Production emerged from the competition as a pleasant surprise, winning a gold. Bold Vodka from Canada also took home a gold in the Corn category. It is also one of the best value spirits from the tasting, selling at only HK$140 a bottle.
Overall, the judges in the panel agreed that most of the samples shown in the competition are varied and good representations of different styles and expressions.

Lizzy Rudd confirmed as Berry Bros & Rudd CEO

Berry Bros & Rudd called off its search for a new CEO after confirming interim executive chairman Lizzy Rudd, who stepped into the top role after the surprise departure of CEO Dan Jago in January, as the firm’s new boss.
Following Jago’s departure, it was announced Rudd would assume the role of executive chairman until a new CEO was appointed. However last month the company issued a statement confirming it had called off the search for a CEO.
“Following much consideration and after discussion with members of our Executive Board and Owners Board, I can confirm we have called off our search for a new CEO and I will be remaining in the role of Executive Chairman for the foreseeable future,” Rudd said.
“With responsibility for the overall strategic direction of the business, I will be closely supported by our Board members as well as our leadership team.”
Rudd, a third-generation member of the Rudd family, is only the second woman in the company’s 300-year old history to helm the renowned fine wine merchant, after her grandmother Ethel.
Having started her career at the firm in the marketing team, where she was responsible for building the global reputation of the firm’s whisky brand Cutty Sark, Rudd stepped back from an active role to concentrate on her family, and was appointed as a Non-Executive Director. She was later appointed deputy chairman when Simon Berry took over as Chairman in 2005, and took over from Berry when he retired in December 2017.
The merchant’s website described Rudd as “central” in communicating the vision of Berry Bros. & Rudd on behalf of the Rudd and Berry families during Jago’s tenure as CEO, providing an “essential” vision in guiding the planned direction of the company and feeding into the overall strategy for Berry Bros & Rudd.

A sale of ex-cellar Château Lafite featuring vintages dating back to 1868 in New York realised over US$7 million and set numerous records last weekend.
Hosted by Zachys, the auction featured 691 lots (3,384 bottles) of wines consigned directly from the cellars of Domaines Barons de Rothschild’s cellars: Lafite, Evangile, Duhart-Milon and Rieussec – to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Rothschild’s acquisition of Lafite.
Zachys said that 213 auction records were set overall and the sale was 100% sold. The final tally for the sale was US$7,866,456.
The sale’s top lot was an imperial of 1959 Lafite which sold for $160,550 (twice its pre-sale high estimate).
A magnum of 1869 Lafite was sold for $123,500, another double magnum of the 1959 went for $92,625 and a single bottle of 1898 Lafite made $86,450.
Bidders were present from all over the world, roughly 56% of the lots offered were sold to American bidders, a further 15% to European buyers and 13% to Asian collectors.
Jeff Zacharia, president of Zachys, said: “I couldn’t be happier with the results of our Lafite auction! From the hundreds of world records, to the truly international bidding, no one can disagree that the Bordeaux market is exceptional, strong and growing. Working with Lafite these past few months has been a highlight of my career, and being able to take the rostrum and set 213 world records in just over five hours is something I’ll never forget.”

UK real estate investment firm Aprirose has acquired the 45-site Spirit Pub Company, owned by Greene King, from British Land for £130 million.
British Land is one of the country’s largest property developers, but has sold off more than £2.5bn worth of assets, including individual shops, supermarkets and office blocks, in the past five years, as reported by The Telegraph.
The portfolio of 45 pubs includes properties in Brighton, Middlesbrough, Newcastle, Nottingham and Twickenham, and brings Aprirose’s estate of leased and managed pubs to just under 200.
Aprirose already had 150 other pubs, including 22 Marston’s sites it acquired from shopping centre landlord NewRiver for £15m in January, and 73 sold by Mitchells & Butlers in 2017, in its portfolio.
Manish Gudka, chief executive of Aprirose, said: “In recent years our engagement with the pub industry has increased considerably.
“The acquisition of the British Land pub portfolio is a sign of our growing commitment to this exciting sector. Our investment into the Spirit Pub Company-branded portfolio is testament to our experience and strong track record in this field.
“Against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty we are finding unique opportunities to acquire interesting assets. The F&B sector is particularly appealing as we seek to build our own bespoke offering.”

With the line between vodka and gin becoming increasingly blurred, some vodka producers are highlighting terroir and provenance to make their liquid stand out. Phoebe French finds out how they are getting their messages across.
For a spirit so transparent and straightforward, vodka is surprisingly murky. What can it – or should it – be made from? Can something that is described as ‘a neutral spirit’ have ‘character’? And where do you draw the line between flavoured vodka and gin?
Where producers are making vodka matters. After what was dubbed the ‘vodka war’, in reference to heated discussions over labelling, in 2007 the European Union voted in favour of allowing vodka made from “other agricultural raw materials”, as well as potatoes and cereals, to be called vodka. Brought about when Diageo began marketing Cîroc as a vodka made “exclusively from grapes,” the measure opened up a raft of possibilities for producers willing to experiment.
On the other hand, it was widely condemned by distillers in the so-called ‘vodka belt’, with Poland, Finland and Sweden voting against the measure, and Lithuania abstaining.
Arguing that vodka should only be made from potatoes and grains, Polish MEP Ryszard Czarnecki said at the time: “Would the French like Champagne made from plums, and would the British accept whisky distilled from apricots? That sounds like heresy. So please don’t be surprised that we are refusing to recognise vodka made from waste.”
Unlike the US, the EU also has a rather liberal definition of what constitutes ‘neutral’. In the US, vodka must be treated after distillation with “charcoal or other materials as to be without distinctive character, aroma, taste or colour”.
Flavoured vodka has a separate category. In the EU, vodka must be distilled and/or rectified “so that the organoleptic characteristics of the raw materials used and by-products formed in fermentation are selectively reduced. This process may be followed by re-distillation and/or treatment, including treatment with activated charcoal.”
In January this year, the Canadian government announced that it was proposing a series of changes to the country’s vodka regulations. These included expanding the list of permitted raw materials to include any agricultural material and permitting the use of other materials beyond charcoal to fully or partially remove any distinctive character, aroma or taste from the spirit.”
As such, unflavoured vodka can be broadly categorised into two genres: neutral and characterful.
With negotiations starting in December 2016 and agreed on in November 2018, the EU’s new Spirit Drink Regulations aim to provide added clarity in terms of production and labelling and enhance the production of Geographical Indicators (GIs). “It’s interesting to see the new EU Spirit Drink Regulations that have come into place with the intention of clarifying definition and descriptions for not only vodka and gin, but all 47 spirit categories,” says Henrik Ellström, global brand director at Absolut.
“Vodka producers will have to keep an ear to the ground to see the effectiveness of the guidelines on producers and consumers in the EU, and the global knock-on effect.”

The sales value of South American wine producer Concha y Toro’s brands have risen in the past 12 weeks owing to a renewed focus on premium tiered products.
 
 

CyT, which produces Casillero del Diablo, Trivento and Cono Sur, has seen “sizeable value growth” in the new, premium-positioned wines that sit above its more established ranges.
Casillero del Diablo has shown 16% value growth overall, according to commercial director Claire Griffiths, “and the new premium Reserva Especial Cabernet Sauvignon, introduced in 2018, has contributed 7% of absolute value growth from a single sku.”
“This is mirrored with Cono Sur, where the Reserva Especial and 20 Barrels tiers together account for roughly 10% of Cono Sur’s value share, but 21% of the value growth in that brand.”
“This is really positive both for our brands and for our customers, to see more value injected into the category from encouraging the consumer to trade up,” Griffiths said.
The Chilean wine giant saw the value of its wine sales rise 8% in the first quarter of 2019, following its move to focus on higher worth priority brands, but net profit fell nearly 1% (0.9%) over the year on the back of higher wine costs and restructuring.
Casillero del Diablo has also hit its record household penetration figure in the UK at 9.1%, according to data from Kantar Worldpanel.
When it comes to Argentine brand Trivento, its Private Reserve Malbec, introduced in 2017, now accounts for 20% of the value growth in the label as a whole. Private Reserve’s sales grew over 107% in the past 12 months compared to the same period last year, and is outstripping Trivento’s positive value growth of 34.7%.

One “leading” négociant in La Place de Bordeaux has already warned that the en primeur system is like a Ferrari in danger of spinning out of control but where does the value in Bordeaux futures currently lie?
Both Liv-ex and Wine Lister have recently released hefty reports on the Bordeaux market as the en primeur campaign begins to rev its engines.
But the start of the Wine Lister booklet began with this quote from a leading Bordeaux négociant: “The context of this year’s en primeur campaign is like a Ferrari with worn tyres and fatigued suspension. The Ferrari here is the quality of the 2018 vintage, the road is the market and the wheels that connect the car to the road are the négociants, who bear the burden of 2016s that aren’t showing any return and 2017s that won’t find their place in the market for years. The faster the driver (the château) goes, the worse the accident will be.”
Last week, using the Liv-ex report, the drinks business reported that the effects of recent campaigns and factors such as Brexit and a depressed Chinese market made the 2018s anything but a sure sell – despite their apparent quality as wines.
The en primeur market is currently far from its peak. Farr Vintners has stated previously that there has been a, “marked fall in demand and appetite for buying Bordeaux vintages en primeur” and buying levels are “not likely” to return to the heights witnessed with the 2009 and 2010 vintages.
As can been seen in the graph provided by Liv-ex, en primeur sales have dropped off a cliff since the 2010s were offered.
The period 2011-2014 was extremely bad with 2013 proving the nadir. The situation improved with the 2015 and 2016 vintages but after making around £82 million with the 2016 campaign, UK merchants saw sales crash to £45m in 2017 – less than the 2011s.
Returns have been another thorny issue for the dedicated claret hound too. Since 2005 around half of the campaigns have seen wines that were cheaper on release than they were en primeur, with the 2009, 2010 and 2011 vintages being the worst offenders – with the first two arguably being the most at fault.
There have been some successes. The 2012 to 2015 vintages all saw their wines rise in price between campaign and physical release and even the 2009-2011 wines have seen their negative returns shortened – especially the 2011s.
As Liv-ex noted though: “Looking at returns to date also suggests that most campaigns have been underwhelming for buyers. Five of 13 have produced negative returns. Even where returns are positive, buyers would have made more money investing in physical stock in some instances: the Bordeaux 500 Index has outperformed En Primeur purchases from 2005, 2006, 2013.”
Yet despite the repeated warnings that en primeur is dead and the négoce system is about to implode and all manner of other alarming portents, there remains thrill, glamour and indeed sound financial sense in buying Bordeaux futures – the trick is which ones you choose.
Which châteaux are getting it right, therefore, and how to measure it?
Wine Lister picked out Beychevelle, Calon Ségur, Canon, Les Carmes de Haut-Brion, Cos d’Estournel, Figeac, Léoville Barton, Lynch-Bages, Pichon Comtesse and Rauzan-Ségla as estates that had pitched their releases correctly last year with their 2017 offers – and indeed several of those have ticked the boxes for many in several of the post-09/10 primeur era campaigns.
A case in point was Les Carmes de Haut-Brion’s release, which Wine Lister called a “masterclass”. As the report said: “One of the only red wines whose 2017 matched its 2016 in quality terms, it was the property’s joint best-ever.
“The 2017 release price put it into the market at a 40% discount to the market value of the 2016, and, crucially, below the 2014 too, making it a very attractive proposition en primeur.”
Combine that with the label’s rising popularity helped ensure it sold out and gave it a boost on the secondary market.
Les Carmes de Haut-Brion and Lafleur were flagged by Wine Lister as offering the best returns for their 2016 vintages between offer and release (up 109%); followed by Petrus (64%), Canon (59%), Carruades de Lafite (58%), Calon-Ségur, Le Pin, Petit Mouton (34%) and Tertre-Roteboeuf among others.
Many of those names crop up in Liv-ex’s own analysis too (sometimes with marginally different figures – Canon’s 2016 is up 71% by its metrics for instance). The first growth’s second labels are a particularly successful area to have risen in recent times, its sub-index in the Bordeaux 500 showing a 226% gain in the last decade, 73% in the last five years, 69% in the last three and 6% in the past year.
Lafite meanwhile remains the strongest of the first growths for now but Mouton has been catching up to it for a while. The worst-performing first growth chart at the moment is that of Margaux.
Other châteaux with strong price performances away from more obvious brands are: Gruaud Larose, Clos Fourtet and Clerc Milon
If there are still winners to pick from though so too are there losers. Unfortunately, despite having produced some exquisite wines in recent vintages it is Sauternes labels that are struggling to keep up, with Suduiraut and Rieussec showing some of the worst returns among labels, red or white.
It’s hard to see a future for Sauternes within the primeur system as it currently stands. Perhaps a new approach is required?
For the reds, on the other hand, it is Pontet-Canet that is listed as one of the more over-valued brands en primeur and its 2016 release is currently down 12.5% on its release. Other brands that Liv-ex notes as being often over-valued are: Troplong Mondot, Evangile, Pavie, Cheval Blanc, Ausone, Haut-Brion, Vieux Château Certan, Pichon Baron and Angélus among others.
Again that is not to say the wines are bad nor even that they don’t deserve to command high prices, it’s just that when measured against the performance of previous vintages and taking scores into account, they consistently look like poor choices to buy en primeur because they will either lose the buyer money and/or allow another buyer to pick them up later for less.
Liv-ex, Wine Lister, all the major merchants and critics involved in primeurs and industry publications such as db now generate a wealth of material every year on this subject from wine quality to price analysis.
There is ‘fair value’ still to be found in en primeur – at all price points and not all of it comes down to accounting, arithmetic and algorithms.
That said, as primeur contracts in its scope and importance to many on all sides of the futures industry, the Bordeaux buyer is better equipped than ever when it comes to making informed buying decisions and will undoubtedly reward market-sensitive châteaux by choosing their wines over those of more tone-deaf neighbours.

Following last month’s big tasting of Pinot Noirs from every corner of the wine-producing world – The Global Pinot Noir Masters 2019 – we pick out 10 outstanding samples from a range of price points.
In contrast to other globally-planted varieties that trip from any wine-lover’s tongue, Pinot Noir is rarely used to make inexpensive plonk. Why? Because creating an appealing Pinot Noir on a tight budget is notoriously tricky. Employ the techniques of high-volume viticulture and winemaking to this grape, and the results tend to be dire. Such pernickety behaviour may frustrate the producer, but it has helped Pinot’s positioning – today, it is deemed the ultimate in sophistication when it comes to top-end drinking.
But, because Pinot is so hard to perfect, it is relatively rare to unearth a wine where the combination of talent, climate and soil have come together to yield something magnificent, and particularly at an accessible price point.
Having said that, this year’s Pinot Masters taught us two things. Firstly, there is good Pinot now available for those without deep pockets, as more producers master the grape’s particular requirements in the field and the cellar.
Secondly, there is a broader sweep of places where Pinot can reach impressive heights. And these are primarily in cooler-climate New World locations, usually near the sea.
For now, if I were to name a single part of the wine world that reliably delivers plenty of Pinot punch for not too much cash, then I would single out Sonoma County. While good Pinots will rarely be found for less than £20 in the UK market from this part of California, one doesn’t have to go much beyond £30 to find something delicious. Move further up the west coast of the US, to Oregon, and one can also fine great Pinot, but the entry-point is higher.
Elsewhere, considering the results from this years’s Pinot Masters, it is apparent that parts of Chile are emerging as sources of lovely Pinot, particularly the Leyda Valley, along with Limarí, while New Zealand’s Marlborough is also becoming a go-to for keenly-priced mid-weight Pinot, and the Adelaide Hills appears to be in the ascendancy regarding this grape. It was also good to taste a lovely, reasonably-priced example from Italy’s Oltrepò Pavese, where Pinot Nero is the flagship variety.

You can see the results in full in the April edition of the drinks business, but for now, I have picked out a top 10 selection from the Pinot Masters. These have been chosen to encompass a range of price points and styles, and, importantly, all of them have been judged blind by Masters of Wine.

A new project is resurrecting historic vineyards in the Yonne in North-East France that were abandoned around a hundred years ago.
The Les Hauts-Glaciers plots near Sens
Domaine des Sénons, a partnership between local businessman and founder Frédéric Duponchel, Chablis winemaker Bernard Raveneau and agronomist Florian Ruscon, has announced it is planting the first three hectares in Saint-Martin-du-Tetre, as part of a wider project to bring back historic vineyards that were ravaged by the onset of phylloxera and powdery mildew in the 19th century, and the advent of the railway, which allowed the Parisian market to source cheaper wines from the South of France.
The vineyard will comprise two hectares of Chardonnay and one of Pinot Noir on the Les Vaux- Gaudins and Les Hauts-Glaciers plots, 5km from Sens. Initial geological and chemical testing confirmed the steep hillside consisting of calcareous bedrock, with a clay topsoil diffused by a huge quantity of flint – a “rare mix” that made it a “unique and highly promising terroir,” the company said.
It is the first of a series of new plantations in three villages in the Sénons area, Saint-Martin-du-Tertre, Paron and Rosoy, which the three partners hope to increase gradually to around 30 hectares, with 3-4 hectares planted each year.
The wines will be certified as Protected Designation of Origin, of Yonne, with wines named after the plots where the grapes were grown.
Speaking to local French newsite L’Yonne Republicaine, Duponchel said the team had been working on the project for two years.
“I have always known that there were very active vines here: the first go back to antiquity, then there are many texts that report a high quality wine between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries,” he told the paper. “It was more common in the nineteenth century [but] phylloxera and competition with southern vineyards meant that there has been no production for a century.”
Chablis winemaker Bernard Raveneau has overseen the selection of both high-quality clones and massal selection which the company says will “maximize the expression of terroir”, with the aim being to farm the vineyards biodynamically.
“We do it for a matter of taste and ethics. The fields on which we are going to plant our vines are virgin, it would be a pity to put some chemistry there,” Duponchel said.
They have recently mulched the vineyards with a bio-textile made of hemp and corn to protect plant materials and enhances their vigour by encouraging microbial activity in the soil.
A new gravity-fed winery is set to be built in the hillside village of Paron with the medieval chalk caves used for maturing and storage the wines.
The team will be joined by Marie Duponchel, who is currently studying for a technical qualification in wine and vineyard management.

Based on our recently published guide to London’s top 50 most powerful sommeliers, we have picked out the top female sommeliers and wine buyers currently behind the wine lists at London’s top restaurants for wine.

The guide followed on from our Wine List Confidential Top 100 restaurants for wine in London – which ranks restaurants on the strength of its wine list alone – in May last year.
The people profiled in this latest guide have been ordered loosely according to the rankings of restaurants in last year’s Wine List Confidential.
Here, we have picked out the females that made that list. In other words their contribution to London’s on-trade, and their wine list at their respective establishments, was deemed to be among the best in the capital.

World’s first traditional method sparkling wine bottled under screwcap launches

First up in this year’s list is Hampshire winery Hattingley Valley, who claim to have launched the world’s first traditional method sparkling wine bottled under screwcap closure.
Using new “screwcap technology”, the seal is able to withstand up to 50 bar of pressure, apparently.
Head winemaker, Emma Rice, commented: “Innovation has always been widely encouraged at Hattingley and for the past two years we have been working in close partnership with leading industry scientists to ensure the bottle and closure can cope with the pressure of traditional method production processes.”
Simon Robinson, owner and chairman, added: “Some people report difficulty in opening cork with wire-hood closures on sparkling wine so this scientific development, whilst controversial, will make it easier for everyone to enjoy our award winning wine. The scientists behind the invention ensure us that the closure can withstand up to 50 bar of pressure – now that will get the party started with a bang!”

The ‘Tran-scend-ent’ fine wine sale held by Sotheby’s in Hong Kong at the weekend has “smashed” the record for a private owner collection, making US$30 million.
The three day sale (29-31 March), realised HK$233,582,518 (US$29,756,077) in total, far surpassing the low pre-sale estimates and saw over 2,500 lots sold.
The leading lot were three 12-bottle cases of 1990 Romanée-Conti from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti which sold for HK$2.7m (US$347,520) each, while a case of 1985 Romanée-Conti realised HK$2.3m (US$300,131) and a further three cases of 1945 Château Mouton Rothschild HK$1.9m (US$252,742) each.
Already the highest estimated wine auction ever, the sale offered an exceptional array of blue chip fine wine from Bordeaux, Burgundy, Champagne, the Rhône and Italy – with 619 lots of Coche-Dury, 359 lots of Dom Pérignon, 142 lots of Guigal and 249 lots of Mouton Rothschild among the collection.
With a final total of almost US$30m, it surpasses the US$21.9m made at the sale of Bill Koch’s collection in New York in 2016 and comes close to matching the US$34.5m made through the sale of Henri Jayer’s cellar last June.
Jamie Ritchie, Worldwide Head of Sotheby’s Wine, commented: “Transcendent Wines was aptly named, setting the record for the highest value private wine collection ever sold at auction at US$30 million, beating the total achieved at Sotheby’s in 2016 for the William I Koch sale.
“This result continues our record-setting trend and marks a significant moment in the history of wine auctions, presenting a new benchmark in the wine industry.
“The scale, quality and value of this collection is totally unprecedented, and the superb result is a fitting outcome, as collectors continue to compete for the world’s greatest wines.
“To present the most important single-cellar collections at auction is to quench the insatiable thirst of today’s enlightened collectors who are buying to open and enjoy the bottles, a sentiment very much in tune with the man who put together this outstanding collection.”
Another sale is being held in Hong Kong today featuring more lots of Mouton Rothschild and rare Moutai baijiu.

UK pub and brewing company Fuller’s has made a series of changes to its board structure shortly after its beer business was bought by Japanese drinks giant Asahi.

Fuller’s sold its cider, soft drinks, wine, distribution and wholesaling business, along with its beer and brewing operations, to Asahi earlier this year in a deal worth £250 million. The Competition and Markets Authority has said it has “no further questions” in regard to the purchase, which also included Fuller’s brewery in Griffin and Cornish orchards, craft beer brand Dark Star and Nectar Imports.
In a note sent to shareholders last week, the company announced a reshuffle of its board that would see three members made redundant. The disposal of the beer business will result in both the managing director of Fuller’s Inns, Jonathan Swaime, and MD of Fuller’s brewing business, Simon Dodd resigning from their posts by the end of 2019.
Additionally, Richard Fuller will step down as Corporate Affairs Director next year.
Dodd will resign as MD of Fuller’s Beer Company and as a director on 30 April 2019, while Swaine will resign from his post and as a director of the company on 11 October.
Fuller will resign on 31 January 2020, but will remain on the board as a non-executive director.
The note explained, that while Fuller’s beer business helped the company to maintain a point of difference in a competitive UK market, chairman Michael Turner said the company’s pub and hotel business would be a “driver of future growth”, and generates 87% of its operated profits.
In terms of appointments, the note said that Fred Turner, currently heading the company’s tenanted pub business, will become the Company’s retail director, responsible for the managed division of Fuller’s Inns, and will join the board as an Executive Director in June 2019.
Last month, Fuller’s head brewer, Georgina Young, left the company to become head brewer at Bath Ales, which was bought by Cornwall-based St Austell in 2016.

As reported by the Manchester Evening News, a memo was sent out to managers and put on display at a pub in Rochdale which stated that the brewery’s policy “is not to allow customers mobile phones, laptops or similar inside our pubs”.
It states: “If a customer receives a call then he or she should go outside to take it in the same way as it is required with smoking. Whether outside or inside, tablets and iPads must be prohibited.
“Customers must not be allowed to receive transmitted pictures of sport or download music apps on the brewery’s premises either inside or outside.
“The brewery’s policy is that our pubs are for social conversation person to person.”
How the pub will enforce the ban has not been elaborated on.
The pub chain has also banned televisions and music in the past in order to maintain a “traditional, uncompromisingly Victorian aesthetic”.
It has also banned swearing in April 2017, with signs in pubs telling customers: “We wish to inform all of our customers that we have introduced a zero tolerance policy against swearing in all of our pubs. Please kindly respect this policy”.
The Samuel Smith pub chain operated some 300 pubs up and down the country, and is owned by Humphrey Smith, who is aged in his 70s.
Last year, another pub made headlines after it made £20,000 in fines after banning mobile phones. Landlord Mark Robson implemented a mobile phone ban when he opened the Just Reproach pub in December 2011, putting up a sign which read: “Your babbling disregard for others is more than a little annoying.”
If anyone’s phone rings or beeps, he fines them £1, with the money made donated to charity.
Elsewhere the Gin Tub in Hove installed a Faraday Cage in its ceiling to disrupt mobile phone signals, which means that customers have to go outside if they wish to make a call or send a text, as well as check social media.

Waitrose has launched a new range of spirit-specific mixers which claim to “enhance” rather than “mask” the spirit they accompany. ," 1st April, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/04/waitrose-launches-new-range-of-spirit-specific-mixers/,"1st April, 2019

Waitrose has launched a new range of spirit-specific mixers which claim to “enhance” rather than “mask” the spirit they accompany. 
The Sekforde range comprises four low-sugar sparkling drinks, each designed to pair with a specific spirit, including: a blend of Sicilian orange, rosemary and Gentian bitters to mix with whisky & bourbon, a blend of lime, mint, rose and cacao for light & spiced rum, a quinine free tonic alternative containing raspberry, rose and sage for gin and vodka, and for tequila & mezcal – a sparkling blend of prickly pear, fig and cardamom
Founder Talula White said the ‘”unique” drinks plugged a gap in the market and honoured the tradition and craft of making spirits by “enhancing”, rather than masking, the true flavours of the liquid.
“Our dedicated Sekforde mixers are crafted with the aim of enhancing, not overpowering the beautiful flavour profiles of the spirits we love,” she said.
Pierpaolo Petrassi MW, head of drinks buying at Waitrose & Partners described the range as “interesting and innovative”.
“As our customers become more discerning with their spirits, it only seems right to offer premium mixers which enhance the specific flavours. Served over ice, they are also a sophisticated soft drink alternative for those looking for a non-alcoholic option with great flavour,” he said.
Sekford mixers are available in store and at Waitrose.com for £1.95 for 500ml

Majestic Wine UK retail boss Josh Lincoln will head up the combined Majestic and Naked UK operation as it prepares to restructure and rebrand the business as Naked Wines, and it confirms changes to its buying team.
Lincoln’s new role, which was first revealed by The Grocer, is UK MD of Majestic and Naked, with Naked MD Eamon Fitzgerald moving onto a role more focused on finding “new star winemakers”, the company confirmed to db, based in Ireland.
Lincoln joined Majestic Wine as customer director in January 2017, having spent eight years at Naked Wines, most recently in the role of global sales and service director. He was promoted to head up the retail business in January 2018, following the departure of former Screwfix boss, John Colley.
The company is also understood to have made changes to the buying team with the appointment of Nadia Williamson from Bibendum, who will work alongside buyers James Reed, Beth Pearce, Joe Aylmer and Imogen Bowen-Davies, and the departure of two senior buyers.
Head of buying Cat Lomax resigned from the company at the beginning of January, with her departure unrelated to the planned restructure, having accepted a new role which will start from 15 April. Lomax had joined Majestic from Waitrose in September 2016, taking over from Matt Pymm as head of buying across the Majestic Group.
Senior wine buyer Julie Buckley left the business last month, the company confirmed, having joined Majestic from Sainsbury’s in July 2017, where she was responsible for French, fine and fortified wines.
The departures follow that of trading director Richard Weaver. Weaver was temporarily replaced by transformation director Sarah Appleton, but a permanent replacement is likely to be announced in the coming weeks, a Majestic spokesman confirmed today. 
He also confirmed they would not be replacing the Head Buyer role, with the buying team reporting directly into the new Trading Director.
Meanwhile Appleton has now taken on the role of strategy and commercial board director, according to her LinkedIn profile. Appleton joined the wine retailer in 2017 as transformation director, having spend eight years at Sainsbury’s, most recently as transformation director. There she was responsible for leading the commercial strategy across the retailer’s £20 billion food business, having headed up Sainsbury’s supply chain operation for ambient, fresh and frozen. She joined the business as strategy manager in 2009, and later became planning manager.
Weaver worked at Majestic for 20 years, and was one of the only senior Majestic executives retained for the transformation of the retail division following the company’s merger with Naked Wines in 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile. He become buying and merchandising director responsible for the retailer’s £225 million buying budget, and later trading director in the company’s reorganisation in January 2018. He joined the company as a retail management trainee, and spent fifteen year working on Majestic’s ecommerce arm, first as a manager and later as ecommerce director.
The retailer has made a series of changes to its management and buying teams since it was acquired by Naked Wines in April 2015. Former Screwfix boss Josh Colley was appointed to lead the UK retail division, but left within two years to be nearer his family, with CEO Rowan Gormley taking on the role temporarily, supported by Weaver and the then operations director Rob Farnsworth, both of whom have since left. Lincoln was subsequently appointed to head up the UK retail division in January 2018.
The company is in the process of restructuring to refocus on the Naked Wine brand, as it prepares to divest of the Majestic Wine retail operation, and is set to reveal further details, including the the extend of store sales and job losses in June.

Belgium-born Túbo Logier will replace current guest chef Anna Tobias at Hackney-based natural wine shop, bar and restaurant, P. Franco, later this month.
Túbo Logier and Anna Tobias
With a culinary history including sous chef at both The Clove Club in Shoreditch and Italian restaurant Luca in Clerkenwell, Logier grew up in Belgium, training at In de Wulf and later Chambre Séparée in West Flanders under the direction of Kobe Desramaults.
Before arriving in London, Logier travelled and cooked in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, with these experiences influencing his cooking techniques.
The 23-year-old chef said: “I think it would be hard to identify my cooking as one style or cuisine, I’m using food more to explore my Asian roots and tying it together with being brought up with European food in a fun, interesting and creative way, using all the techniques I’ve been influenced by in the kitchens I’ve worked.”
With the menu yet to be unveiled, it is rumoured that P. Franco will return to the fine-dining styles of the chefs who preceded Anna Tobias.
Consistently opposed to pretty plates of food, during her residency Tobias promoted a unique approach to straightforward cooking, frequently using the hashtags #beigefood and #brownfood to accompany images of her dishes on social media.
Logier has suggested that guests can expect combinations such as smoked aubergine, oyster, and beef fat; Boudin and squid sauce; and potato, crab, and beer.
The handover took place at P. Franco on 31 March, with Logier having the opportunity to cook in collaboration with Tobias and become accustomed to working in the small kitchen which is situated within the main space.
@tubologier: “Milk ice, parsley root and pickled chervil stem to get a slight idea of what I’ll be cooking @pfranco_e5”
Logier follows a number of chefs to take the helm at P. Franco. Tobias replaced chef George Tomlin in September 2018 and prior to Tomlin, guest chefs have included Pepe Belvedere, Giuseppe Lacorazza, Tim Spedding, and Will Gleave.
Belvedere and Gleave now run the kitchen at P. Franco’s sister restaurant, Bright, which opened near London Fields last May. Together with Phil Bracey, co-owner and wine aficionado across the group, Gleave opened the restaurateurs‘ third site Peg, on Morning Lane in Hackney, in February.
Túbo Logier will be at P. Franco from 11 April.

Sotheby’s finished up a four-day sale in Hong Kong yesterday (1 April), with the final session bringing the overall tally to a record-breaking US$35 million.
Following on from the success of the three-day private own sale dubbed ‘Tran-scend-ent’ which brought in close to US$30m, the final day of the auction added an extra HK$39.5m (US$5m) to the total.
At the centre of yesterday’s sale were 25 limited edition cases of Mouton Rothschild which made HK$7.1m (US$904,261) combined and a 50 lot collection of rare Kweichow Moutai – the largest ever offered by Sotheby’s – added HK$9m (US$1.1m).
The sale’s top lot in fact were 12 half-bottles of the limited edition Hong Kong Reunification with China Memorial Moutai 1997, which realised HK$806,000 (US$102,757).
Sotheby’s senior specialist, Paul Wong, said: “The 50-lot collection of Kweichow Moutai, our largest-ever offering, saw a spectacular sell-through rate of 100%, as the most valuable spirit in the world gains popularity across Asia. The collection was led by The Hong Kong Reunification with China Memorial Moutai 1997, and we were thrilled to see this limited-edition set achieve a great price – aptly in the city of Hong Kong.”
The money raised through the sale of the Mouton Rothschild will go towards renovation work at the Palace of Versailles. Another 50 cases will be sold at future sales in New York and London.
Philippe Sereys de Rothschild, chairman and CEO of Baron Philippe de Rothschild, said: “I am very happy with the results achieved in Hong Kong for 25 of the limited-edition Versailles Celebration Cases, all of which were sold, raising over HK$7 million / US$900,000. We are delighted that all the proceeds of this sale will go towards the restoration of a landmark of the world’s cultural heritage, and are looking forward to welcoming all the successful bidders to celebrate with us at the Palace of Versailles on 21 September, where we will be serving four ex-cellar vintages of Château Mouton Rothschild, including the historic 1945. We are looking forward to Parts II and III of this auction, in London on 17 April and in New York on 4 May.”
Meanwhile, commenting on the sale as a whole, Jamie Ritchie, worldwide head of Sotheby’s Wine, said: “We are excited to have had such a monumental, $35 million, record-breaking weekend, which included presenting the first of this unique series of the Château Mouton Rothschild Versaillles Celebration Cases.
“Numerous bidders from all around the world showed their love of Mouton and their desire to enjoy the legendary Mouton 1945 that will be served at the celebratory dinner, while supporting restoration at Château de Versailles. Fifty lucky people have booked their places at this special dinner and will be joined by the buyers of the remaining 50 cases to be offered for auction in London and New York”

The Bruichladdich Distillery on Islay has announced plans to expand its facilities while also upping its commitment to the environment by installing its own multimillion-pound on-site malting operation.
The distillery hopes to run entirely on renewable energy within the next five years.
Currently, the distillery grows 42% of its barley locally, However the distillery is required to transporting this Islay-grown raw material to Inverness for malting, incurring unwanted transportation costs.
Last year, the distillery acquired 30 acres of land next to the distillery for the malting operation, where it hopes to develop its sustainable farming practices and conduct further barley experimentation.
While the on-site malting operation is subject to planning permission, the team hopes that the new facility will be operational by 2023 as part of a £20m investment.
The distillery says the plans will reduce its carbon footprint, and will also help it toward its aim of running entirely on renewable energy within the next five years.
It is also investing in warehousing and has built two new warehouses over the past three years. Another four warehouses will be constructed over the next few years.
Chief executive Douglas Taylor said: “Running a business from an island makes us distinctly aware that our social, economic and environmental impact must be a positive one. We feel strongly about our responsibility to the island and the people of Islay.
“In recent years, we have endeavoured to be more sustainable in our operations and more environmental in our actions.
“Some have been straightforward, like stopping using bottled water and introducing the use of electric vehicles, or more complicated, like habitat protection, wildlife corridor agreements with landowners for barley growing or engineering a solution that re-uses the hot waste-water from distillation.
“These actions are just the beginning of a long-term vision; to be more sustainable in all we do, and to leave behind a bright future for generations to come.”​

Far removed from the medieval town and 19th century chateaux in Saint-Émilion, Château La Grâce Dieu Des Prieurs, owned by Russian entrepreneur Andrey Filatov, is an outlier in a region that’s steeped in tradition.
From left to right: Laurent Prosperi, director of Château La Grâce Dieu Des Prieurs; Darius Allyn MS, and Natalia Vremea, export manager of Art Russe presenting a vertical of Art Russe wines from the 2014 to 2016 vintages.
At a recent masterclass hosted by the drinks business Hong Kong, and led by Darius Allyn MS together with estate director Laurent Prosperi, around fifty of Hong Kong’s leading sommeliers and buyers were invited to see what made the estate different.
Located between the towns of Saint-Émilion and Pomerol, the 8.5 hectare boutique winery defies convention and stands out from its neighbours in terms of label design, winemaking and its modern architecture.
To begin with its grand vin, named ‘Art Russe’, is the only wine the estate produces and celebrates a rare combination of Russian art and wine.
Devoid of the vineyards or château conspicuous on most Bordeaux wine labels, each vintage features 12 different reproductions of original Russian art pieces curated by the Filatov-owned Art Russe Foundation, which boasts the biggest collection of Russian artworks of the 19th and 20th centuries in the world.
Fifty of Hong Kong’s top sommeliers, wine buyers and trade professionals attended the Art Russe masterclass on 13 February in Hong Kong at the Renaissance Harbourview Hotel
Speaking of the singular wine production, Prosperi explained: “We want to make a good representation of the terroir and the vintage, so that’s why we decided to make one wine.”
The winery itself has undergone a complete makeover that has transformed the once humble century-old estate into a modern architecture marvel by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel.
Featuring a cylinder fresco that depicts vinegrowing from budding to harvest, alluding to the full cycle of a vine’s life, the modern winery is also equipped with a vinification room and two separate underground cellars for fermentation and ageing. All are designed to allow gravity flow without any pumping over for excessive extraction.
Full phenolic ripeness
Inside the cellar, it’s Louis Mitjavile, renowned Merlot expert and son of Francois Mitjavile, who sets its wine apart from surrounding neighbours.
Different from Médoc, classical Saint-Émilion is always sweeter on the palate, thanks to the more lush, plum character of its Merlot compared with Cabernet Sauvignon. Well-versed in cultivating the grape, Mitjavile has another trick up his sleeve to coax the maximum plushness and flavours out of the grape by playing a long waiting game.
Harvest starts only, as Laurent Prosperi, director of Château La Grâce Dieu Des Prieurs, explains at the masterclass, when “everything in the bunch is completely matured”.

“This means the grapes are picked with full phenolic ripeness, a practice that Mitjavile has insisted and inherited from his father who would pick grapes for as long as two weeks back in 1980s,” Darius Allyn MS explains.
Even in challenging vintages threatened by fungal disease, the quality of the grapes with a relatively late harvest is guaranteed with meticulous selection in the vineyards. For an 8.5ha vineyard, the winery employs about 15-20 harvesters to select the grapes, says Prosperi. Yields per hectare are strictly controlled at a lower level (roughly 30hl per ha), another signature of Mitjavile, adds Allyn.
When it comes to ageing, Mitjavile delivers yet another surprise by using only 100% new Radoux blend barrel, made from “most finely grained” and the “tightest” French oak.
This led Allyn to praise the oak integration in the three wines showcased at the masterclass, namely 2014, 2015 and 2016 as “seamless”, which is no small feat as one of the most constant criticisms against Saint-Émilion is the less than satisfactory integration of oak and alcohol in the wine.
Praising the harmony, the Master Sommelier enthused: “More importantly, the oak, it’s 100% new oak! Again it’s tight-grained and has a perfect degree of toasting, the perfect production. The wines integrate seamlessly.”
A trio of success
The 2014 vintage, the first release from the château under the new ownership, is already hailed by Allyn as the “most elegant” and “most perfumed” out of the trio, and came out as one of the two favourites among more than 50 attendees by a show of hands.
During the year, producers on the Right Bank had to contend with more rain in the winter, which created a challenge for early ripening Merlot. But for an estate situated on the Saint-Émilion plateau with a mixture of limestone, loam, gravel and sand in the soil, the mixture helped to regulate water levels.
Additionally for a small estate, the hands on approach gave an extra layer of scrutiny on quality.
“When you are a smaller estate, you can really focus on attention to detail on every simple aspect from grape growing to winemaking, and they only make one cru wine, no secondary label,” Allyn exclaims.
Art Russe wines in different formats
Following the 2014 vintage, guests tasted the 2015 vintage, a stellar vintage for Bordeaux, which according to Prosperi is a “precise vintage” that saw everything done perfectly. From growing to harvesting, it was a triumphant year for Right Bank Merlot to such an extent that the estate director called it “ideal”.
Even among a cross-the-board stellar vintage, two appellations stood out. Critics singled out Saint-Émilion and Pomerol as the star appellations for the vintage. A generous wine, redolent of fruits, with intensity and depth, the wine is a favourite among the attending guests. “The vintage is really expressing the warmth of the year, and the grapes have really seen the sun,” adds Allyn.
For the 2016 vintage, Right Bank luckily avoided a wet spring, but was met with a drought lasting till mid September. The berries are therefore smaller and more concentrated and packed with tannins. Describing the wine, though still in its infancy, as an in-between of 2014 and 2015 vintage, Allyn said: “It has the ripeness but not necessarily the density in 2015. And it has the purity. With more time it will show more complexity”.
Aside from the liquid in bottle, the affinity between art and wine is something that the estate takes pride in. In addition to its regular bottlings, Art Russe’s magnum collection are bottled in ancient Bordeaux amphora-shaped bottles.
Different from the darker green colour opted for the 750ml bottling, the magnum comes in a bright green colour and is adorned with an additional 13th artwork, says the chateau.
Various gift-packaging are also available including a chess case, leather case and an award-winning special gift box made of wood and concrete.

Laurent Ponsot, the Burgundy Iconocast and a key figure in convicting wine fraudster Rudy Kurniawan, has raised doubts on the popular Netflix documentary Sour Grapes about Kurniawan, claiming the second half of the documentary is “fictional”.
The Burgundian vigneron revealed during a recent trip in Hong Kong while launching his own wines, that he had been to Indonesia to conduct his own investigation into Rudy Kurniawan’s supposed family members depicted at the end of the documentary and had come to rather different conclusions than the filmmakers.
The documentary features a dizzying chronicle of excess and deception and dissects a fascinating case of fine-wine fraud and the con man Rudy Kurniawan who cheated investors out of millions.
One of the most high profile victims of Kurniawan’s scheme was billionaire collector Bill Koch, who also happens to be notoriously litigious. Koch previously took fraudsters Hardy Rodenstock and Eric Greenberg to court for selling him fake wines.
Ponsot himself was also featured in the documentary and is known in wine world as ‘Burgundy’s Sherlock Holmes’ for his own crusade against Kurniawan. One scene that’s been most keenly talked about by people in the wine trade is when Ponsot flew to New York to personally stop a lot of 1945 vintage of Ponsot’s grand cru Clos St Denis from being sold at an Acker Merrall & Condit auction.
The wine is undoubtedly a fake because Domaine Ponsot did not start producing the wine until 1982.
Ponsot later testified in court against Kurniawan, which led to his conviction and 10 years in jail.
However during the interview in Hong Kong in March, the winemaker claimed that the second half of the documentary is fake, and raised doubts over Kurniawan’s key family members depicted in the film including his “purported” mother, brother and uncle Eddy Tansil, alleging the characters depicted in the film are in fact not related to Kurniawan.

Tansil escaped from the Cipinang Prison, Jakarta in 1996, during a 20 year prison sentence for embezzling US$565 million of loan money acquired from Bank Pembangunan Indonesia.
But asked about details, Ponsot refused to specify but insisted that he went to Indonesia and did his own investigation to reach these conclusions.
All the details and his personal investigation, as he teased, will be revealed in his upcoming memoir.
Until then, we will have to wait with bated breath.

1. What is your favourite restaurant in London? I have three favourites; Dinner – at the Mandarin Oriental – Stefan (Neumann MS) and his team are just amazing, ditto the food; China Tang, Igor must be one of the best hosts of any restaurant I know – you come in and he makes you feel immediately at home; and Sexy Fish, such a cool vibe and a great team. I am eternally grateful to them for having helped us make our white Cabernet such a big success – one of their top selling wines by the glass. ‘
2. Where / what is your favourite wine offering in London and what would be your go-to first glass of wine when you get there? I’m really keen to try out Noble Rot and I would probably go for whatever the sommelier recommends. It’s best way to discover new things and latest trends!
3. How does London compare to other big global cities in terms of the wine lists you find there? London is the wine and food capital of the world – if it is not here it does exist! The variety and depth, the rate of innovation is unrivalled – and given the quality you get, it is not super expensive.

English sparkling wine producers should consider the high acidity that the country’s climate generates to be a strength and a unique selling point, believes several of England’s top winemakers.
While English sparkling wine has faced criticism in the past for high and unbalanced levels of acidity, there is a growing consensus that the industry has matured, having amassed the necessary levels of experience and knowledge to create balanced wines that pay homage to the country’s leaner style of wine.
Head winemaker of Gusbourne in Kent, Charlie Holland, is one member the industry that is championing the role that acidity plays in English wine.
Gusbourne’s Charlie Holland.
“We have to look at what our strengths are in England, and one of them is we have higher acidity than some areas of the world producing sparkling wine,” he said. “We need to embrace that and show that off. It should be positive story.”
“Acidity is a dirty word in the mind of the wine consumer. But for me, acidity is one of the most important attributes of a wine, it’s what brings vibrancy, freshness and helps it to age. It’s a very valuable component.”
Listing the practices that winemakers use to soften their wines, such as careful canopy management, yield control and malolactic fermentation, Holland in particular highlighted the role of ageing and releasing a wine when it is ‘ready.’
“It’s about getting grapes ripe, getting phenolic ripeness and sugar levels up, but it’s also about ageing,” he said. “The wine we’re about to release [a 2014 blanc de blancs] has had 42 months on the lees. The key thing for English wine is that it does need this lees ageing to balance it out and give it a creaminess and a roundness.”
Having sufficient volumes of wine in the market, something that the record 2018 will assist with, will enable more producers to have enough cash flow in order to lay stock down for longer.
Ruth Simpson, co-founder of Simpsons Wine Estate in Kent, believes this is essential.
“The industry is managing acidity much better now, both through expertise that has been honed over the years and through ageing wine for the right amount of time,” she said. “We’re not trying to rush it out into the market place, and are working with techniques such as malolactic fermentation. Probably in the early days [the criticism for high levels of unbalanced acidity] was justified but now we’ve moved on. There are a lot of techniques you can use.”
Mike Wagstaff, owner of Greyfriars Vineyard in Surrey, agrees. “If you talk to people now, they would say that, in general, English sparkling wine needs a year longer ageing in most years that they thought when they started,” he said.
“Putting it very crudely, managing the acidity has always been the biggest challenge in English wine. Because of the climate, we’re always going to produce lower potential alcohol and more acidity in the grapes. It’s how you manage it. That said, you need some acidity. We’re not trying to produce a copycat Champagne.”
Wagstaff uses the example of his blanc de blancs, of which he makes a version that has spent some time in oak, and another which hasn’t.
“The oaked version was ready to drink 18 months before the unoaked expression, and we released it with 5g/l dosage compared to 7.5g/l in the unoaked,” he revealed.
Wagstaff is clearly confident in the winery’s ability to balance acidity with fruit flavours in the wine, having recently released a non-vintage blanc de noirs with a dosage of 2g/l and 100% barrel fermentation. At the launch last month, he said that they were considering the possibility of releasing it as a zero-dosage, before opting for a low level of sugar.
Tamara Roberts, CEO of Ridgeview in Sussex, explained that the estate has created two tiers of wine, describing them as “fast moving blends” and “top tier long-ageing wines”.
“You have to be quite careful in managing your acidity through these wines,” she said. “You don’t want to lose the acidity or they’ll become flabby. The acidity shouldn’t necessarily be at the same level, you’ve got to be mindful of the turnover of stock. You don’t want to be sending out wines with extremely high acidity that were built for ageing, without the ageing.”
Jacob Leadley, owner and winemaker at Hampshire’s Black Chalk, concurs: “Certain wines have been released too early or made in a style that is a little lean. However, we must remember that acid is a big part of the joy in English wines, and as the industry grows we are finding ways to work with acid and celebrate – rather than fear – it.
“Fresh, fruit forward wines with depth and complexity from lees ageing is a style that I feel English Sparkling wine can and should be a world leader in,” he added.
Hattingley Valley’s Emma Rice.
Emma Rice, head winemaker at fellow Hampshire winery Hattingley Valley, believes there’s “no real justification” for acidity levels that are too high.
“I think criticisms of the industry are justified, if you look at any wineries around the world, you get some good wines and some bad wines,” she says. “I think there have been a few too many wines that have been overly acidic – acid management is the key to making English sparkling wine.”
She also believes that bottling pressure can also be to blame, augmenting the perception of acid in a wine.
“We always aim to go under the six bar of pressure when we do the tirage, so we always round down rather than round up when we’re doing the sugar additions and we’re very careful when we’re doing the dosage after disgorging so that the sugar balances with the acid,” she said.
“Another criticism I think that could be quite fairly laid at English sparkling wine’s door is being bottled with too much pressure, far too assertive a mousse which makes the acid taste more aggressive. It’s important to be careful as to how much you protein fine the wine as this affects the formation of the bubbles. You need protein in the wine to form the bubbles and to get a good bubble formation, and I think that some people tend to strip too much of the protein out in fear of it being unstable, but actually the mousse ends up being quite harsh.
“Something that is often said about Hattingley wines is the soft mousse – that’s the slightly lower pressure, not deliberately in a crémant style, but with lower pressure and really managing the acidity in other ways too.”

Italy’s flagship wine show, Vinitaly, returns to Verona this weekend (7-10 April), boasting tastings and masterclasses, and showing the best wine that Italy has to offer. Db checks out what’s on offer.
Around 4,500 exhibitors from 35 countries will take part in the event, and organiser Veronafiere expects to welcome 130,000 visitors from more than 140 countries. Last year the number of accredited foreign buyers grew by 6% to around 32,000, along with growing international interest in markets including the US (up by 11%), China (34%), Scandinavia (17%) and Poland (27%).
Buyers from 50 countries have been invited to the 2019 edition, from mature markets such as Europe, North America and Australia, as well as from newer ones, including countries in Central and South America, Asia, and Africa.
The objective, VeronaFiere says, is to facilitate meetings on stands and through the ‘Taste and Buy’ matching service.
Giovanni Mantovani, CEO of Veronafiere, said the business matching is part of a number of initiatives designed to make business flow more smoothly, from the dedicated app and multi-lingual portal, to new geolocation in the exhibition halls.
New for 2019
here are also new areas in the show itself, including The Organic Hall (Hall F), which aims to boost the visibility of companies focusing on sustainability, organic, biodynamic and natural wines. It includes VinitalyBio, as well as a section dedicated to artisan producers, created in collaboration with the Vi.Te collective, which will also organise a series of masterclasses featuring artisan wines.

Another addition for 2019 is The Vinitaly Design show (Hall F), where products designed for wine tasting and service, including furniture for wine cellars, wine bars and restaurants, and bespoke packaging, will be showcased.
“The two new sections at Vinitaly continue our move towards continuous b2b specialisation of the event,” Mantovani told the drinks business.
New exhibitors will be joining regular attendees in the International Wine Hall, where an official delegation from the Croatian Chamber of Economy is taking a stand for the first time. The number of exhibitors from France and Hungary has also risen, along with twice as many Spanish producers. Kosovo is also returning to the show.
Meanwhile, the relocation of VinitalyBio means there is more space for independent winemakers belonging to Fivi (The Italian Federation of Independent Winegrowers) in Hall 8.
Growing interest in the International Wine Hall convinced the organisers to dedicate two meeting rooms to tasting, Mantovani said, alongside a wider calendar of workshops and tastings.
The tastings are one of the distinguishing features of Vinitaly. This year there will be more than 90, from the ‘Tasting ex … press’ featuring wines from around the world, the Tre Bicchieri walk-around of Italian wines with Gambero Rosso, to a tasting of ‘revolutionary wines’ by young, dynamic female winemakers guided by Ian D’Agata in collaboration with the Women of Wine Association.
Vinitaly’s appeal
Mantovani says Vinitaly’s appeal among wine professionals – buyers, restaurants, sommeliers, and technicians – is “truly 360°” – in part thanks to its focus on quality food that helps bring wine alive. This is complemented by having the International Exhibition of Quality Agro-Foods, Sol&Agrifood, and Enolitech running alongside the show.
“This distinctive feature is flanked by Vinitaly’s ability to help companies do business 365 days a year thanks to initiatives and promotion implemented in Italy and abroad through Vinitaly International,” said Mantovani.
As Mantovani argues, “The huge diversity of Italian wine can easily meet the needs of more mature markets in North America and Northern Europe.”
“Quality Italian wine has always been held in high regard but – unlike our main French competitors – we have never really promoted it in a unified manner,” he say. “Italian wine continues to grow in North America and Asia but we need to do more to improve awareness of its rich biodiversity, which includes over 540 native grapes. It is a wealth that may become a disadvantage if not appropriately explained.”
Vinitaly and the City 
Wine, culture, meetings and entertainment also come together in the squares of Verona for Vinitaly and the City, the off-show Vinitaly event that comprises four days of tastings alongside gourmet street food.
The off-show allows operators from all over the world keen to experience Verona by night, a unique experience with concerts, meetings and guided tours around the most evocative locations in the historic city centre. This year will see three theme-based Grand Wine Showcases set up in three locations around the city, highlighting “Red Wines”, “White, Rosè and International Wines” and “Sparkling Wines and the Great Italian Red Wines”.
Vinitaly and the City was spun out of the main event in 2016.
The success of the “buyers at the show and wine enthusiasts in the city” formula has proven us right,” Mantovani says.

The UK’s Bestway Group – which bought Conviviality’s retail brands after its collapse last April – has claimed the companies including Bargain Booze will add around £500 million to its annual revenue.
In its annual results filed at Companies House and available this week, the group said that although a “significant“ amount of work needed to be done to stabilise the newly acquired business and reassure franchisees, the management were confident that the deal would “complement the wider Bestway offering and be value accretive in the long-run”.
“It is expected that the c.800 strong retail portfolio will add close to £0.5 million to the Group‘s annual revenue in the future,” chairman Sir Mohammed Anwar Pervez said in the annual statement.
Pervez admitted it had been a challenging year for the group but that all the businesses, which includes Bestway Wholesale, the UK’s largest independent wholesale group which bought around 800 stores from Conviviality for £7.5 million last April, remained profitable.
The retail business, which comprises the Bargain Booze, Wine Rack, Select Convenience and Central Convenience fascias, including 600 franchisee stores and 207 corporate-owned stores, is now organised under a previously dormant company, Bestway Retail Limited, but the wholesale business committed to be one of its key financial supporters for around a year.
The group’s results showed the group’s overall revenues rose 9% to £3.2 billion, despite profits falling on the back of some of its international businesses. Underlying profit before tax fell by 25% to £331.9 million, it said, due to difficult trading conditions in Pakistan and the devaluation of the Pakistani rupee (In addition to its UK wholesale and retail operations, the group operates the largest cement factory and the second largest private bank in Pakistan).
Pervez also warned that “the uncertainly regarding Brexit will likely result in further austerity and continue to dampen economic growth”, confirming that the group had taken necessary measures to reduce key risks to the business.
Bestway Wholesale
Turnover at the wholesale business, which were also filed at Companies House last week, fell 2% last year on flat profits, the documents revealed. Recorded turnover fell 2.45% to £1,612 million, while profits were down nearly 1% to £6.623 million, although operating profit before tax rose £3.9 million to £10.3 million, or around 38%.
Group chief executive Zameer Choudrey said market conditions remained challenging, with the continued pressure of the multiple grocers taking a “keener interest” in the wholesale sector, although he noted the online business had nearly doubling its number of registered users and mobile transactions had grown by nearly 10% in the last year.
“The market environment is increasingly competitive and the strain has been too much for certain providers, with Palmer & Harvey and Conviviality PLC entering administration and Blakemore closing down its wholesale arm,” he wrote.
“Despite these challenge, BW has remained committed to its strategic plans and has been able to grow its market share and profitability on the back of the increased customer turmoil.”
He added the UK wholesale business would focus on growing its market share and developing its infrastructure, while the retail business would concentrate on stabilising itself and rebuilding trust and relationships with customers “following a tumultuous period”, as well as improving the quality of franchisees going forward.
In December, Bestway Retail posted results at Companies House reflecting the three months of trading since the acquisition, in which it recorded a loss of £0.3million on turnover of £80.5 million to 30 June 2018.
The directors said this was in line with expectations and that synergies and improvements being put in place would deliver improved financial results next year. It added that had the Conviviality businesses been acquired at the start of the financial year, it would have made profits of £1.1 million on turnover of nearly £400 million (£399.6 m).

The World’s 50 Best Restaurants has named the second recipient of its culinary scholarship, launched last year in association with BBVA, which offers an ambitious chef the opportunity to cook in three premier kitchens.
Andersen Lee, a 20-year-old chef from Montreal, Canada, has been announced as the second ever recipient of the 50 Best BBVA Scholarship, with 24-year-old Jessie Lui winning the first in 2018.
Entries were received from aspiring chefs in 74 countries, with 1,200 applicants between 18 and 50 years of age applying for the single scholarship.
Sponsored by global financial group BBVA, applicants are required to have less than three years’ experience in a professional kitchen and the scholarship is awarded following a three-stage judging process led by 50 Best and BBVA representatives, including written submissions, supporting testimonies, self-produced videos and live interviews.
The five-month programme will give Lee the opportunity to spend six weeks working at Odette in Singapore, which was recently named The Best Restaurant in Asia in the 2019 edition of the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants awards, followed by six weeks at Core by Clare Smyth in London, and finishing with six weeks at Quintonil in Mexico City.
Raised in Montreal, Canada, with Taiwanese and Hong Kongese heritage, the young chef has two and a half years’ professional cooking experience in his home city, most recently at French-Canadian restaurant Bouillon Bilk. The scholarship will see Lee work outside of Canada for the first time.
Group editor of The World’s 50 Best Restaurants, William Drew, said: “We were blown away by the strength of all of the entries, which is an indication of the incredible talent, passion and drive of so many aspiring chefs across the the world. Andersen’s philosophy on food, his fresh thinking and his deep desire to learn stood out. We are very much looking forward to seeing where the future takes him.”
Before embarking on the programme, Lee will be presented with the scholarship at The World’s 50 Best Restaurants awards ceremony sponsored by S. Pellegrino and Acqua Panna which will be taking place in Singapore on the 25 June.
Lee said: ”To have won the 50 Best BBVA Scholarship 2019 has truly left me at a loss for words.  Being a chef is not just about the food, it’s about the respect of the environment, discovering yourself and working with ambitious people. I’m so excited for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”

Consumer confidence remains fragile across the UK grocery markets, retail analysts have warned, despite the stoicism of the public in the face of Brexit uncertainty and political indecision.
Young man with a shopping cart is in a supermarket picking up wine.
In a note issued today, Shore Capital analyst Clive Black, Darren Shirley and Greg Lawless said trading had been muted but not “especially weak” in recent weeks and was expected to continued into the second quarter of the year.
“Consumer confidence remains fragile and the wider British political circus does little to raise the consumers’ mood,” they noted.
The ”more sedate” trading momentum went hand-in-hand with a continuation of a broadly rational pricing environment and a focus upon reducing operating expenses and the tight management of cash flows.” he said.
This marked an improvement on the mood throughout the autumn, they said, which had been improved by a stronger than expected Christmas. However, the second quarter of this year is likely to suffer when compared with last year’s trading, which was boosted by the later Spring heat wave, a royal wedding in May and the early success of the England team in the World Cup/
“Against the tough comparative backdrop we expect underlying trading for the British supermarkets to be tougher in Q2 and Q3, before much more favourable comparatives come in to play in Q4 CY2019,” the trio wrote.
The team added that the UK grocery scene remained “highly competitive”, with robust growth from the discounters which were still opening stores, albeit at a slower rate.
Retail outlook
Meanwhile data published by Kantar this week showed year-on-year sales growth across the grocery market of 1.4% in the 12 weeks to 24 March, as Asda overtook Sainsbury’s to become the second largest retailer in the UK with a 15.4% market share.
Sainsbury’s however remained in the number two spot for pure food and drink sales with its Taste the Difference booze range contributing to strong own-label sales.
Meanwhile the discounters continued their ascent, with Aldi seeing sales up 10.6%, taking its market share to 8%. More households shopped there than in Morrisons, head of retail and consumer insight Fraser McKevitt said, who also noted that London as its fastest-growing region.
Lidl also saw strong growth, with sales up 5.8%, providing a 0.3 percentage point boost in its market share, to 5.6%.
The Coop also saw growth of 6.5%, with its market share now 6.1% and Waitrose’s 1.3% growth was its strongest performance since last August.
Tesco’s growth was more muted at 0.5%, with sales of £138m in the period as its promotional activity reached 40%, 90 percentage points above the average 31%.

We at team db want to celebrate the very best bottles from our Global Wine Masters. Every Wednesday, we’ll select a wine that picked up either a Gold or Master from our competition series, and tell you why the judges loved it.

This week, we’re looking at Pinot Noir. Specifically, this German expression from Winzergenossenschaft Achkarren, not too far from the Rhine…
“For those looking beyond Burgundy to sate their Pinot fix, then Germany is a great place to end up,” said db editor and chair of The Global Wine Masters, Patrick Schmitt MW.
“Often overlooked as Pinot fans leap to California, Otago or Oregon, warmer parts of Germany such as the Pfalz or Baden, as well as the sun-soaked slopes of the more northerly Ahr, can yield delicious cherry-scented reds from this pernickety grape.”
“Mixed in among the samples in this year’s Global Pinot Noir Masters was this first-rate wine from a growers-cooperative in Baden. Gaining a Gold-medal score from all the judges, it was bursting with kirsch-like concentrated dark cherry aromas along with some attractive vanilla notes from ageing in barriques. A ripe and juicy, generous style of Pinot, but with a refreshing finish, it was awarded high marks for being big and taught, like a four-wheel drive BMW.”

Diageo has announced a new policy that will see it offer both male and female employees based in the UK an equal 52 weeks parental leave upon the birth of a child, with the first 26 weeks fully paid.

From today, parents employed by Diageo in the UK will be eligible for the same fully-paid 26 weeks, and up to 52 weeks unpaid, retaining benefits and bonuses regardless of gender, sexual orientation or whether they become parents biologically, via surrogacy or adopt.
The move is part of Diageo’s leading work to support gender equality and to create a fully inclusive and diverse workforce, “where barriers to career progression are removed and talent is retained and nurtured”.
The offer is open to all of Diageo’s 4,500 employees across the UK, including approximately 3,100 colleagues in Scotland who are primarily in manufacturing roles.
“True gender equality in the working world requires fundamental changes to a broad range of working practices, including a shake-up of the policies and cultural norms around parental leave,” said Mairéad Nayager, chief HR officer at Diageo.
“Today’s announcement is about matching ambition with action and supporting all of our colleagues – regardless of gender – to experience the joy of raising a young family, while continuing to thrive at work.”
The new policy will also see the company strengthen support for parents as they return to work, including the option of keeping in touch days, parental coaching, flexible working policies and access to free independent counselling.
Minister for Women and Equalities, Penny Mordaunt, added: “I’m delighted to see Diageo making this move. Shared parental leave gives both mums and dads the chance to spend quality time with their child in the important first months of their life, creating a bond that will last a lifetime.
“Employers can reap the benefits too. We know that flexibility in work is proven to create happier, more loyal and more productive workforces. Action like this is exactly what we are encouraging as part of our forthcoming strategy which will aim to empower every woman in the UK to achieve their true potential.”

Frapin has launched a new 15 year old Cognac, crafted by cellar master Patrice Piveteau, which will join the house’s ‘Trésors du Château’ collection.
Frapin 15 Year Old is distributed by Louis Latour Agencies in the UK.
Frapin 15 Years Old is a cask strength XO Cognac made from grapes grown entirely from Frapin’s own 240-hectare Grande Champagne estate in the heart of the Cognac region.
Harvest, distillation and ageing all take place at the Frapin domaine allowing Frapin to control every step of the production process, from vineyard to bottle.
Frapin 15 Years Old blends eaux-de-vies aged in both humid and dry cellars, with the former lending “roundness and richness” while the latter gives “finesse and elegance”.
Patrice Piveteau has chosen to pass the Cognac directly from barrel to bottle with no adjustment or chill filtering in order to preserve the naturally rich aromas and flavours.
He describes the resulting Cognac as “aromatically complex with notes of freshly sawn wood, vanilla and black tea which evolve to dried flowers”.
“The palate offers flavours of dried fruits, toast and a lingering finish with touches of spice,” he adds. “This is a robust Cognac while simultaneously evoking the traditional finesse of Frapin style on the palate.”
Frapin 15 Year Old is distributed by Louis Latour Agencies in the UK.

Chilean wine giant VSPT Wine Group, which was named Ethical Company of the Year at The Drinks Business Green Awards 2018, has been re-certified for the fourth time under the National Sustainability Code.
The code requires a producer to perform across three areas: Green, orange and red, relating, respectively, to the vineyard, corporate and social activities, and winery operations.
During the first half of January 2019, VSPT Wine Group was re-audited for the 4.0 version of the National Sustainability Code (Código Nacional de Sustentabilidad, CNS), which was established in 2013 and is enforced by Wines of Chile.
The code requires a producer to perform across three areas: Green, orange and red. Green concerns the vineyard, orange related to corporate and social activities, and red regards winery operations.
In this fourth re-certification of the code, the VSPT Wine Group successfully passed the independent audits, which are carried out by the Ecocert Group.
These audits also include its long-term grape suppliers.
This re-certification involved assessing a total of 3,464 hectares planted across Chile, including eleven of VSPT’s own estates and eleven long-term grape suppliers, as well as the group’s offices and operations.
“VSPT continues to take concrete steps through its sustainability program, strengthening its commitment both in terms of the environment and that of corporate social responsibility,” the group said.
Last year the wine group committed to producing all of its wines using 100% renewable energy by 2021, while in the UK, it announced a new extended partnership in the on- and off-trade with Enotria & Coe which will “challenge the perception of Chilean wine in the UK market”.
Previously, VSPT announced the acquisition of a number of wine brands and vineyards, as well as a winery, from Pernod Ricard Argentina.
The brands involved in the deal are reported to be Graffigna, Colón and Santa Silvia. VSPT will also be taking control of the Graffigna winery and vineyards Pocito and Cañada Honda in San Juan and La Consulta in the Uco Valley in Mendoza.
VSPT has referred to the deal as a “strategic acquisition to continue the development of its product portfolio”. The wine group already controls Argentine wine brands Finca La Celia and Bodega Tamarí.
VSPT’s Chilean portfolio includes San Pedro, Tarapacá, Leyda, Viñamar, Casa Rivas, Misiones and Santa Helenes. The group was formed in 2008 through the merger of Chilean wine groups Vina San Pedro, controlled by beer and soft drinks giant Compañía de las Cervecerías Unidas (CCU), and Viña Tarapacá Ex Zavala.
It is the second largest exporter of Chilean wine and the leading wine producer in the domestic market. It manages over 4,000 hectares of vines and produces 16 million nine-litre cases a year.

A fire that broke out yesterday morning at Masons Gin distillery in Yorkshire, reportedly after a still exploded, is thought to have caused significant damage, with six fire crews working to tackle the blaze.

The fire is thought to have broken out shortly before 8am on 2 April at the distillery building in Bedale.
Masons Gin has since confirmed that no members of staff were injured in the incident. Fire crews from Northallerton and Bedale initially attended the scene in four fire engines after receiving a call at 8:03am. On arrival, the firefighters sought further assistance from crews from Leyburn, Ripon, Richmond and Stokesley, and mobilised specialist equipment from Harrogate, Malton and Thirsk. Durham and Darlington Fire Service also provided the use of their aerial platform.
Due to the intensity of the blaze, a nearby petrol station was evacuated and trains were stopped on the adjacent Wensleydale heritage railway as fire crew accessed water supplies form the other side of the line.
The emergency services put out the blaze with the aid of four main jets, a high volume pump and an aerial ladder platform, which helped to ventilate the premises via the roof.
Masons Gin was founded by Karl and Cathy Mason in 2013 and moved to its current premises in 2017. It produces three main expressions: the original gin flavoured with juniper, lime and orange rind; the lavender edition; and Yorkshire tea gin.
A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said at the time: “We received a call at 08:03 to reports of a fire in an industrial premises, in Aiskew, Bedale. A number of repeat calls were then received from members of the public.
“Four fire engines were mobilised to the scene, along with officers. On their arrival they requested additional fire engines (and an aerial ladder platform from Darlington) and support vehicles attend.
“The fire involves a single storey industrial building. Crews are working hard to tackle the fire and prevent the fire spreading. Everyone has been accounted for and there are no reports of any injuries.”
Janet Gleeson, reporter for the Northern Echo, said workers contacted the distillery owners yesterday morning to say one of the stills had exploded and they had evacuated the building.
Speaking to the BBC, Karl Mason said: “Obviously it’s very early, we are still in shock. The fire brigade have been fabulous and all the staff got out safely.
“It’s destroyed I think but it’s just a building, everyone got out safely that’s what matters.”
Masons Gin later released a further statement: “We’d like to thank everybody for their concern and well wishes following a fire at the distillery today. We can report that all staff are unharmed and there are no injuries sustained.
“We’d like to express our thanks to the emergency services and staff at SPAR for their support this morning. Updates to follow in the coming weeks.”

Closures company Tapì Group has partnered with near field communications specialist Thinfilm Electronics to develop a range of smart closures to tackle the growing problem of counterfeiting in wine and spirits.
The new companies have signed a letter of intent in order to pool their collective knowledge in order to “better serve the needs of the wine and spirits industry”.
Based in Massanzago, Italy, Tapì believes its collaborations with California’s ThinFilm will create “dependable, cost-effective closure solutions for brand protection and consumer engagement purposes”.
Tapì Group chief executive officer, Roberto Casini, said: “This is further confirmation that, here at Tapì, we are capable of innovating and anticipating trends in our sector. We are excited to offer cutting-edge IoT technology in the beverage sector, which will protect and enhance our customers products on several fronts. Counterfeit products not only cause worldwide losses in the sector, but they are a big health problem.
“In addition, brands are also now looking for new ways to interact with their consumers. These cleverly integrated smart closures can help our customers track and protect their products while at the same time strengthening their reputations on the market by increasing engagement with consumers.”
Kevin Barber, chief executive officer of Thinfilm, said: “We are thrilled to be joining Tapì in addressing the rampant worldwide counterfeiting problem plaguing their spirits customers, as well as giving brands empowered consumers unique and engaging experiences.
“Many brands are looking for new insights in order to move from indirect, transactional engagement to direct, long-term relationships with their consumers, as well as improvements to their packaging that will make the products more attractive and safer.”
Tapì and Thinfilm have already begun to develop NFC-enabled OpenSense closures in order for brands to protect their products against counterfeiters. The technology can detect when a seal has been broken, alerting the consumer that the bottle may have been tampered with. Another closure, based on the Thinfilm Speedtap tag, is also in development.

A man could be facing criminal charges after walking into an off-licence in Florida with an alligator tucked under his arm.

The incident happened in Jacksonville, with Robby Stratton, as reported by Gentside, strolling into the liquor store armed with an amphibian.
At about 5ft long, we are estimating, the alligator was small enough to be carried around the store by Stratton.
During the impromptu shopping trip, Stratton can be seen ‘chasing’ other customers with the river-roving reptile, while Stratton picked up a six-pack of beer.
The episode was filmed by another individual, with Stratton later admitting that he couldn’t even remember having taken the alligator into the store with him. 
The amphibious animal’s mouth was muzzled, but its presence was enough to spook fellow shoppers, and the man is now at risk of being prosecuted.
You can watch the video here. 
The strange tale reminded us of several other cases of animal invading institutions of alcohol, such as the rampaging peacock of 2017, who trashed a liquor store in Los Angeles, and Francis Bacon, the Vietnamese pig who was banned from a London pub for stealing pints and head butting its patrons…

The BIVB Chablis has confirmed that the Chablis Winegrowers Union is to implement a new innovative methanation system that will recycle all by-products from the winemaking process, hailing it a breakthrough in the region’s move toward greater sustainability.
Chablis: The £4.8m methanation facility is expected to be up and running by the autumn of 2021.
It follows a six-month study in Belgium to test the feasibility of the project using a ‘pilot’ system, with wine by-products brought over from Chablis to find the most efficient method of methanation.
Methanation is the conversion of carbon oxides and hydrogen to methane and water through hydrogenation. It can also be used as a means of producing a synthetic natural gas, and as a way to store energy produced from solar or wind power, which would allow it to serve as a potential carbon capture mechanism.
Last month the Union’s general assembly voted in favour of the project.
The methanisation processing area will be located in the south of Chablis where 700 winemakers, belonging to the Union, will be able to bring the by-products of their winemaking to be processed.
Grape pomace will be passed through a machine to separate any seeds, which research found unsuitable for the process. These will instead be set aside for alternative uses such as cosmetics.
The remaining wine pomace will then be placed in covered silos where the fermentation process begins; then finally into the methanisation machine.
The biogas produced by the machine will be directly injected into the Gaz Réseau Distribution France (GRDF) circuits, the natural gas distribution network in France. The remaining product left in the machine will be sold as fertiliser.
Louis Moreau, president of the BIVB Chablis, said: “We are proud to be one of the first wine regions to put in place a methanation process of this kind and on this scale as well. Sustainability is a key focus for Chablis and the rest of Bourgogne so our winemakers are always looking at new innovations on both small and large scale projects.
“We believe the new system will be a success and with a younger generation of winemakers who have travelled the world for their studies and then come home to Chablis, we will work hand in hand with them to bring in new practices to protect the environment and our terroir.”
The project represents a €4.8 million investment, jointly funded by the Chablis Winegrowers Union and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, as well as subsidies from the local region.
The project is already underway and is expected to be up and running by the autumn of 2021.

Artist alexander Hall’s mews house is easy to find – a trail of pastel-coloured paint spatters along a cobblestoned street leads to his door in a quiet corner of West London.
Artist Alex Hall
Half English and half Swedish with wild blond hair and boyish good looks, the mixed-media artist seems to treat everything as a potential canvas, down to his white jeans, which are artfully flecked with paint. While he tends to stick to canvases, Hall has put his designs on everything from cars, clothing and furniture to Champagne bottles.
Having worked as a professional artist since 2011, his big break came in 2015 when he was asked by avid collector Peter Jones – of Dragon’s Den fame – to create an original artwork for a charity auction Jones was organising. Sitting in his former studio in an old fire station in Battersea, Hall had a flash of inspiration when he began reminiscing about a memorable trip to the South of France when he was a teenager, which involved driving around in a soft top with a group of older friends, then making memories as the stars came out over bottles of Dom Pérignon.
“I wanted to recreate the feeling of the rush of endorphins I got while I was driving, then the shared experience of drinking Champagne together, which helped us open up to one another and tell our stories,” says Hall. The resulting painting featured a trio of Champagne bottles with ‘Breakfast’, ‘Lunch’ and ‘Supper’ on their labels.
Hall wasn’t expecting much of a reaction to it, but it ended up selling for “a considerable amount” at the auction. The buyer was so taken with the work that he asked Hall to paint four more versions to give to his friends, one of whom happened to be restaurant mogul Richard Caring. “I’ve been very lucky in my career as everything I’ve done has led to something else,” Hall reflects.
Celebrate life
Other high fliers soon became fans of his work and asked Hall to create original paintings for private clubs in London, shooting lodges in Wales and holiday homes in Courchevel. Having initially focused on animals, Hall has made a name for himself by painting the trappings of success – from sports cars and Champagne bottles to polo ponies. The aim of the works is to celebrate life rather than flaunt wealth – having lost people close to him, Hall is only too aware of the brevity of life and the importance of making the most of every moment.
Before he discovered painting Hall had a passion for putting things together. “I loved Lego as a kid, and was building dining room tables at eight. My uncle was a carpenter, so encouraged that creative streak.” His artistic endeavours at school began with landscapes, houses and cars painted with oils. “In my mind they were really boring conventional subjects. I always enjoyed doing them but never enjoyed looking at them,” says Hall, who doesn’t see the point in creating art that aims to replicate reality. “If a camera can do a better job then that’s not art to me. Art is all about ideas and the artist’s ability to interpret their subject matter. The shape of the bottle is the only reference I make to Champagne, because it’s universally recognised and understood. The spirit of what I do comes from a desire not to dwell on the past but look forward to the future and give people the feeling of excitement you get from anticipation.”
Hall realised that he might be able to make a career out of his hobby when he sold his first painting aged 16 to a Swedish collector for £950. Spurred on by his mother’s exemplary work ethic, since then Hall has relished the freedom that comes with a creative career. “There are no rules when it comes to art. If you’re told that something you’ve done isn’t right, then you end up approaching a canvas anxiously and trying to control the work. You can sense the anxiety in it – the paint looks stagnant and the movement isn’t fluid,” says Hall, who has no such inhibitions when he paints. “I love the thrill of a blank canvas.”
db’s 200th cover: Hall’s Hip, Hip, Hooray painting has gone on sale for £10,500
The rise of Instagram has been instrumental in helping Hall to raise his profile and widen his audience. As have his connections with well known collectors. His paintings are proving so popular, that Hall now finds himself in the fortunate position of being able to pick and choose his commissions. He’s come a long way in a short space of time. “In the past few years I’ve had to say no more than yes to work, as I don’t want to look back on my career and think ‘I didn’t enjoy doing that painting’,” Hall says. “I’m fortunate to be in this position. I feel very lucky that it’s all working out.”
While he paints everything from perfume bottles to classic cars in his signature drip style, like Damien Hirst and his dot paintings, and Andy Warhol and his soup cans, Hall has made a name for himself with his Champagne bottles, and is keen to keep developing the theme. “I feel I’ve found my niche with the Champagne bottles and I’m so grateful my work has been accepted, because I like the idea of doing one thing really well,” he says. Hall creates around 30 original paintings a year, which he sells through his artistic platform, Haut de Gamme, meaning ‘high-end’ in French. Hall is keen to highlight that Haut de Gamme is the name for his work, rather than an alias like Banksy. “It would be very arrogant to refer to myself as being ‘top of the range’. It’s more about wanting to do my best. When I was growing up my parents taught me to put the same effort into the things people wouldn’t see, like painting the back of a cabinet even if only the wall gets to appreciate it.”
A painting inspired by Chanel N°5
This year Hall has branched out from bottle paintings to painted bottles, and has just been commissioned by Australian Formula One driver Daniel Ricciardo to paint the Jeroboam of G.H. Mumm Champagne he received after winning the Monaco Grand Prix last year. The project is particularly special to Hall as one of his biggest passions is motor racing, having grown up around the sport – both his father and godfather were well known drivers. “I want the bigger bottles I paint to be treated like sculptures and living pieces of art that can be used as things like door stoppers.” The move into bottle painting came after Hall was commissioned by the InterContinental Hotel Group last summer to hand paint 200 bottles representing each of the operating hotels in its portfolio.
When he first got the call, he thought it was a prank. After a representative from the hotel convinced him otherwise, Hall found a large studio in Ealing in which to create the piece. His vision for the work was clear. “I wanted it to look like a random mass of bottles when viewed from the hotel’s entrance, then when viewed from another angle it reveals the number 200,” he says.
Working to a tight deadline, after three months of planning, it took Hall a few weeks to paint all 200 bottles. “I was living on adrenaline and working through the night in the artificially lit studio. The whole thing was being filmed and I had all the bottles lined up in rows like toy soldiers so as not to mix them up.”

The European Commission has confirmed geographical indication (GI) status for Irish whiskey as well as Irish cream liqueur and Irish poitín.," 5th April, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/04/european-commission-approves-irish-whiskeys-gi-status/,"5th April, 2019

The European Commission has confirmed geographical indication (GI) status for Irish whiskey as well as Irish cream liqueur and Irish poitín.
The Irish whiskey technical file was originally submitted by the Depart of Agriculture, Food and The Marine in October 2014. The file documents the principle physical characteristics of the spirit.
Among them are that the spirit must range in colour from pale gold to dark amber and must be distilled from a mash of malted cereals, with or without whole grains for other cereals.
“The general classification ‘Irish Whiskey/Uisce Beatha Eireannach /Irish Whisky’ also contains three varieties, ‘Pot Still Irish Whiskey’, ‘Malt Irish Whiskey’ and ‘Grain Irish Whiskey,'” the document notes.
“The above varieties can also be combined to form a ‘Blended Irish Whiskey/Irish Blended Whiskey’. Irish whiskey is a spirit distilled on the island of Ireland, including Northern Ireland. It must be distilled to an alcoholic strength of less than 94.8% and is subject to the maturation of the final distillate for at least three years in wooden casks, such as oak, not exceeding 700 litres capacity.”
Irish whiskey must not be matured outside of Ireland and cannot be exported in barrel.
The file was submitted to conform with a 2008 EU Spirit Regulation, which required member states to submit a technical file to the European Commission for each GI registered by 20 February 2015, outlining production methods, ingredients and links with the geographical area in question.
Carleen Madigan, legal advisor to the Irish Whiskey Association (IWA), said: “This is a momentous achievement for the Irish whiskey industry and ensures that the traditions and high standards of the Irish whiskey category will be protected in the EU and globally in markets with which the EU has a trade agreement.
“As sales of Irish whiskey continue to boom globally, we have seen a trebling in the complaints to the association regarding fake Irish whiskey around the world.
“The geographic indication provides the strongest possible protection against these infringements and gives us the basis for enforcement action against misleading products.”
Vincent McGovern, head of the IWA, added: “This week’s announcement was likewise of great significance to both Irish cream and Irish poitín as their technical files were also approved.
“Both categories will benefit from the strong protection and higher profile a European geographic indication provides at home, across the internal market and in export markets worldwide.”

Method and Madness Micro Gin
Irish Distillers has expanded its experimental portfolio with its Method and Madness Irish Gin, the first release from its micro distillery at Midleton, made with botanicals including black lemon and Irish gorse flower.
The gin is the result of a reinterpretation of the historic gin recipes made in Cork in 1798, found in a notebook kept in the Midleton Distillery archive written by a rectifier in Cork called William Coldwell. Made with 16 botanicals, the 43% ABV gin was made in ‘Mickey’s Belly’, Ireland’s oldest gin still, which was commissioned in 1958, and named after Michael Hurley, a distiller at Midleton Distillery for 45 years.
RRP: €50.

Billing itself as ‘Scotland’s farm maltster’, fifth generation working family farm A Milne & Sons has launched a craft malting business after securing a £500,000 funding package from HSBC UK.
Called Crafty Maltsters, the business operates out of the family farm located just outside Auchtermuchty in Fife. Alison and David Milne, who took over the farm from David’s parents in 2014, wanted to find ways to diversify and add value to their existing arable and livestock farm.
The £500,000 investment will be used to build a 3,000sqft shed for storing and processing grain as well as purchasing the equipment needed to turn the grain into malt.
Alison Milne, a former commercial director for the National Union of Farmers Scotland and now owner of Crafty Maltsters, said: “After studying the malting supply chain we spotted a gap in the market for small-scale malting providers that can guarantee quality, locally-sourced malt for brewers and distillers across Scotland.
“We want to help put small-scale malting at the forefront of ingredient supply chain and tell the story of Scotland’s grain-to-glass journey, as well as the value that malt brings to beers and spirits.”
David Rhind, agriculture relationship director at HSBC UK, added:  “We were impressed with Alison’s experience and expertise in the sector and, along with her family, she has clearly spotted an excellent business opportunity.
“HSBC UK is dedicated to supporting businesses of all sizes connected to Scotland’s burgeoning food and drink sector. We wish Alison and Crafty Maltsters every success in taking the business forward.”
The investment is part of HSBC’s £12 billion SME fund of which £650 million is allocated to Scotland.
Scotland Food & Drink, the country’s national agency for the food and drink industry, is aiming to make Scottish brewing a £1 billion sector by 2030. Scotland currently boasts over 130 breweries supplying around 8,000 jobs.

This week, the Bruichladdich Distillery on Islay announced plans to expand its facilities with the installation of its own multimillion-pound on-site malting operation.
The distiller is also keen to reduce its impact on the environment. It currently grows 42% of its barley locally, but is required to transport this Islay-grown raw material to Inverness for malting, incurring unwanted transportation costs.
Last year, it acquired 30 acres of land next to the distillery for the malting operation, where it hopes to develop its sustainable farming practices and conduct further barley experimentation.
While the on-site malting operation is subject to planning permission, the team hopes that the new facility will be operational by 2023 as part of a £20m investment.

"Iconic Scottish restaurant The Strathearn at Gleneagles will once again open its doors this May, following an extensive renovation with interiors inspired by the golden age of railway travel."," 5th April, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/04/gleneagles-hotel-to-relaunch-the-strathearn-restaurant/,"5th April, 2019

Iconic Scottish restaurant The Strathearn at Gleneagles will once again open its doors this May, following an extensive renovation with interiors inspired by the golden age of railway travel.

Founded in 1924, the hotel has welcomed numerous famous names over the decades, from Vivien Leigh, Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir Sean Connery, to John Travolta, Bob Hope and Her Majesty The Queen.
The restaurant’s new design is inspired by the golden age of railway travel, when glamorous socialites would travel from London to Gleneagles to indulge in seasons of country sports and decadent dining.
Created by Gleneagles’s own in-house design studio Ennismore, the new interior will pay homage the flora and fauna of Scotland and to the luxurious fine dining experiences of the 1920s and 30s.
A mosaic-floored orangery will offer guests views of the estate and the Ochil Hills, while a new stage for musical performances will echo the first-class carriage journeys of the early twentieth century.  The area that housed Gleneagles’ kitchen in the 1920s will act as a kitchen-style breakfast counter, as well as an occasional private dining space.
Traditional gueridon service from bespoke dining trolleys will add a theatrical touch to dinner service, offering guests the opportunity to see the team at work as they carve a Scottish smoked salmon, prepare and dress a salad, or flambé a ‘Steak Strathearn’ on request.
CEO of Gleneagles and Ennismore, Sharan Pasricha, said: “As one of the final strands of our three-year design transformation, the renovation of The Strathearn restaurant was always going to be one of the most important phases of all. After years of meticulous planning, 12 months of interior design work and four months of careful renovation, we can’t wait to unveil the beautiful new look in May. Originally known simply as ‘the Dining Room,’ the restaurant has been a destination for decadent dining and lively celebrations since Gleneagles first opened nearly 100 years ago.
“It’s been cherished by generations of guests, so we didn’t want to radically change the fabric of the space or the spirit of the experience. Instead, we wanted to take the essence of The Strathearn and turn up the volume. By amplifying all the elements that are so well loved – the elegant décor, the history, the lively atmosphere, the culinary theatre and the exceptional food – the team has brought back the vibrancy, energy, playfulness and glamour of fine dining experiences a century ago.”
Daniel Greenock, who has returned to his native Scotland following his tenure at Marcus Wareing’s Michelin-starred restaurant at the Berkley Hotel and the world-renowned three Michelin-starred Eleven Madison Park in New York, will take the helm as restaurant manager.
Using the finest Scottish seasonal and locally-sourced ingredients and celebrating classic French cuisine, the menu will be devised by a kitchen team led by head chef, Jason Hardcastle; executive sous chef, Richard Dalgleish; executive pastry chef, Phil Skinazi; and overseen by executive chef, Simon Attridge.
Advanced Court of Master Sommelier, Jean-Marie Contestin, former manager of wine at the two Michelin-starred Gidleigh Park and Le Pont de la Tour in London, will curate a wine list that has doubled in size to 700 labels. A selection of over 100 single malt whiskies will also be on offer.
The new breakfast area, The Scullery, will offer a choice of ‘naughty’ and ‘nice’ options. The ‘nice’ will provide guests with a fruit and juice bar, dairy and gluten-free options and an avocado station, whereas the ‘naughty’ will include game, charcuterie, bread, and pastries featuring Gleneagles’s own sausages, haggis, and carved bacon.  An open kitchen will see chefs make fresh pancakes and eggs to order alongside a cocktail station devoted to the Bloody Mary.
Porridge will also feature as a highlight on the breakfast menu, with guests choosing between an à la carte menu and a rich and indulgent version in The Scullery, based on an award-winning recipe and with a choice of decadent toppings.
A new honey station will offer local heather, clover, rapeseed and blended honeys sourced from hives based in the local countryside, with one of the producers less than 7 miles from the hotel. Gleneagles is installing eight of its own hives with a focus on producing honey from bees that forage upon the natural wildflowers, heathers and heathland of the hotel’s 850-acre estate, with the hope of collecting the first harvest of Gleneagles honey later this year.
The Strathearn reopens in May.

Founded in 2005 by Brett Woonton, Charlie Young and Elena Ares and inspired by the wine bars of Spain and Italy, Vinoteca provides informal restaurant and bar hybrids with a large selection of wines on offer. Each site has its own wine shop, offering UK delivery, with the company launching its own wine membership club in 2019.
The first Vinoteca in Farringdon was followed by those in Marylebone, Chiswick, King’s Cross and the City, with the company currently operating five sites within London.
Vinoteca City, the biggest to date, occupies two floors in Bloomberg’s new European headquarters.
Now, it is reported that Vinoteca is in negotiations for the acquisition of a prime site in central Birmingham, at 1 Chamberlain Square within the Paradise development, which would be its first outside of the capital.
Will Baxter, partner at Dow Schofield Watts in London, said: “Vinoteca’s highly experienced management team are passionate about their brand. As interest in wine continues to grow in the UK, their ability to offer high-quality products at accessible prices in a friendly, informal setting has proved highly popular with customers and landlords. The team are now seeking further investment to allow them to take advantage of the huge growth opportunities.”
Specialising in providing fundraising and corporate financial advice to the hospitality and leisure sector, Will Baxter and Payam Keyghobadi have advised brands including Bel & The Dragon, Giggling Squid, Rosa’s Thai Café, Mowgli, Las Iguanas and triyoga.

Viticoltori Ponte has been cultivating its vineyards in the north-east of Italy since 1948. Founded by a formidable band of winemakers in the aftermath of WW2, it now counts 1,200 members within its ranks and produces 1.25m nine-litre cases a year from 2,000 hectares of vines. Here, winemaker and operations manager Damiano Canali, who joined the company in 2010, explains the benefits of a co-op model, and how he is taking Ponte’s portfolio to new heights.
Viticoltori Ponte’s winemaker and operations manager, Damiano Canali
What is Ponte’s key focus in the winery?
Mainly sparkling wines, with an important focus on Prosecco DOC and DOCG Valdobiaddene. Regarding still wines, we are one of the leading companies in the production of Pinot Grigio (also a new sparkling version) and some reds, such as Merlot and Cabernet.
What are the characteristics of wines from north-east Italy, and what makes your portfolio stand out?
In the eastern part of Veneto, the wines stand out for their freshness; in smaller quantities we have some red wines destined for ageing. At Ponte, we look to our white wines (Prosecco & Pinot Grigio primarily) for fruity and floral notes, which allow us to obtain an elegant and balanced wine that evolves, as in the case of Manzoni Bianco, into mineral notes. In the reds, as well as fruit, we also look for spicy complexity, which comes from the use of oak. In aged red wines we look for complexity, given by its natural evolution and use of select toasted woods.
What are the benefits of working as part of a co-op for a winemaker?
Working with a company such as Ponte is a huge advantage as a winemaker, as your are able to follow the entire process, starting with the grape (during harvest), to selecting the best cuvées for both small and large batches of product. This represents a very important guarantee
for buyers, who consistently receive quality wines.
What new trends are you seeing with regards to sparkling and Prosecco?
There is much debate about rosé Prosecco. Not everyone agrees on this issue, but personally I think it is right. All the most famous wines have their rosé versions, such as Champagne, and in Italy the Trento DOC or Franciacorta. The market will be the final judge of the success or failure of a product. The demand for brut wines with less sugar is also increasing.
How can winemakers differentiate their offer and raise the quality of Prosecco?
I think that the right path has been taken, but for further improvement producers must invest in technology to enhance the conditions of vinification and to prevent malolatic fermentation during the preservation of the bases, and also experiment with new yeasts in foam forming to improve their nutrition, thus avoiding moments of cell stress during the refermentation, which could lead to less clean fermentations.
With regards to still wines, what big trends are emerging?
Still wines are suffering from the success of sparkling wines. In the future, I believe we will have an even greater separation between consumers oriented towards base wines, and evolved consumers who will prefer more complex wines. A style that may be of interest are aromatic wines, such as Sauvignon Blanc and Traminer, which can catch the consumer’s attention with their distinct aromas. We have included a Sauvignon Blanc and a Traminer in our range for restaurants.
Looking ahead, what are Viticoltori Ponte’s aims and ambitions?
Viticoltori Ponte is aiming to increase its presence on the market. Our goals are to increase the sales of our own-branded products, including both sparkling wines and still, and to be recognised for our wine quality, service and reputation. Viticoltori Ponte pays a lot of attention to its customers’ needs and market demands. As well as products from the DOC delle Venezie appellation, we are proposing a Pinot Grigio Spumante Brut using the Charmat method. It is excellent as an aperitif, and matches well with fish.

"Champagne shipments to the UK fell by 1m bottles in 2018, although the British market for the fine French fizz has “stabilised and rebalanced”."," 5th April, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/04/champagne-shipments-to-uk-fall-by-1m-bottles/,"5th April, 2019

Champagne shipments to the UK fell by 1m bottles in 2018, although the British market for the fine French fizz has “stabilised and rebalanced”.
Following the release of official Champagne shipment figures for 2018 at ProWein, db can confirm that the UK market has seen a decline in Champagne imports, but at a lower rate than the previous year.
While 2017 witnessed a drop in shipments of more than 11% – taking the UK market down by almost 4 million bottles to 27.8m – last year saw that number drop by 3.6%, or 1m bottles, to total 26.8m for 2018.
With the average price of Champagne in the UK retail sector on the rise, and sales by volume slowing at a reduced rate, the British market may be smaller, but it is also more upmarket, according to Andrew Hawes, who is chairman of the UK Champagne Agents Association and managing director of Mentzendorff, the UK importer and distributor for Bollinger.
As a result, during an exclusive interview with the drinks business, he said, “Champagne in the UK is heading back to where it was 30 years ago – which is a smaller, more premium market.”
While acknowledging the fact that Champagne sales have dropped in the UK, he also recorded a stable market for sales of relatively expensive branded Champagne, collectively known as les grandes marques, along with the emergence of a stronger sector for ‘grower-Champagnes’ – those produced by vineyard owners using only grapes from their own estate.
“It is easy to look at the top-line number and see it as negative for the UK market, but if you look at the trends below that, then there is an interesting story, and I’m taking the positive angle for Champagne in the UK,” he said.
Such an optimistic outlook concerns the fact that “the long-established quality premium brands are holding their own or in some cases growing share in a falling market.”
He also recorded a marketplace for “the grower side of things”, which is said may be “niche”, but “totally new” and “gathering momentum”.
Continuing, he said that such Champagnes had only recently “found their correct route to market, which is via indie specialists and serious restaurants”, observing that their approach is “terroir-driven, almost Burgundian”.
Far from seeing such a development as a threat to bigger négociant branded Champagne, he said that “the grower movement is rightly drawing attention to their own wines and styles, and helping to remind everybody that this is how all Champagne is produced: it is a quality product.”
As for the slowdown in volume decline in Champagne in the UK, he said that there was a positive story to tell here too, with the market “stabilised and rebalanced”.
Following the Global Financial Crisis (GRC) of late 2008 onwards, he said that volume sales of Champagne in Britain had been “held up” by “high-low” promotional activity in multiple grocers – which prevented the market for Champagne “correcting as much as one might expect it to after the GFC.”
Such price discounting in UK supermarkets was fuelled by the “sudden stock availability” of Champagne following the economic shock, felt globally, post the Lehmann crash.
However, “that cycle has now run its course”, according to Hawes, who said that ‘generic’ Champagne sold at discounted prices was less prevalent in the UK.
“Own-label and tertiary brand activity is still there, but there is less of it,” he stated.
Looking at the longer term, he said that the strength of Champagne was notable.
“If you look at shipments over 40 or 50 years, then Champagne has survived the oil crisis of the 70s, the collapse of the stock market in the 80s, and then the GFC, following by the rise of Prosecco and the rise and fall of Champagne in the supermarkets,” he said.
Consequently, he concluded, “You have to be struck by the remarkable resilience of Champagne in the face of all these things.”
The UK total market for Champagne:
Shipments to the UK in 2018 (Comité Champagne): 26.8m bottles (-3.6%)
Shipments to the UK in 2017 (Comité Champagne): 27.8m bottles (-11%)
Shipments to the UK in 2016 (Comité Champagne): 31.2m bottles (-8.7%)
Shipments to the UK in 2015 (Comité Champagne): 34.2m bottles (+4.5%)
Shipments to the UK in 2014 (Comité Champagne): 32.7m bottles (+6.2%)
Shipments to the UK in 2013 (Comité Champagne): 30.8m bottles (-5.2%)
Shipments to the UK in 2012 (Comité Champagne): 32.5m bottles (-5.8%)
Shipments to the UK in 2011 (Comité Champagne): 34.5m bottles (-2.8%)
Shipments to the UK in 2010 (Comité Champagne): 35.5m bottles (+16.4%)
Shipments to the UK in 2009 (Comité Champagne): 30.5m bottles (-15.3%)
Shipments to the UK in 2008 (Comité Champagne): 36.0m bottles (-7.9%)
Shipments to the UK in 2007 (Comité Champagne): 39.1m bottles (+6.3%)
• Shipments of Champagne to the UK have dropped by 7.4m bottles over the past four years, but have fallen by 12.3m bottles from a peak this century of 39.1m in 2007.
The UK retail market for Champagne:
UK off-trade sales by volume MAT to 05.01.19 (Nielsen): 10.3m bottles (-8%)
UK off-trade sales by value MAT to 05.01.19 (Nielsen): £287m (-3%)
UK off-trade average price per bottle (Nielsen): £23.22 (+5.6%)
The UK retail market for sparkling wine: 
UK off-trade sales by volume MAT to 05.01.19 (Nielsen): 99.8m bottles (-3%)
UK off-trade sales by value MAT to 05.01.19 (Nielsen): £865m (+1%)
• Champagne represents 10% of the UK retail market for sparkling wine, but one third of the category by value.
• It is important to note that the figures above from Nielsen are primarily a reflection of the performance of Champagne/sparkling wine in the UK supermarkets. Nielsen captures very little of the sales through the UK’s independent wine shops or fine wine merchants, and such numbers do not include the on-trade. As a result, these results do not include an important proportion of the high-value sales of Champagne in the UK.

One of Rioja’s leading wineries, La Rioja Alta, has announced the release of its third Gran Reserva wine for its Viña Arana line.
The first vintage of Viña Arana, the 2012, has just been released this month and means La Rioja Alta is the only winery in Rioja with three Gran Reserva expressions.
A blend of 95% Tempranillo sourced from vines in Las Cuevas, El Palo and Las Monjas in Rodenzo and 5% Graciano from the Montecillo estate, the two varieties were aged separately in American oak with racking every six months for three years before being blended in March 2016 and then bottle aged for two more years.
Julio Sánez, winemaker at the estate, said: “The release of this Viña Arana Gran Reserva is a historic moment for us and we have chosen a very dear brand from our winery. For this new wine we used a traditional blending with GR ‘vocation’: the Tempranillo grapes provide structure and elegance and Graciano, only used for our Gran Reservas, provides greater aromatic intensity and acidity. I think it’s the perfect balance for ageing.
“It’s a really fresh and elegant wine with structure and high aromatic intensity, easy to pair and great to enjoy. It’s the next step in our acknowledgment of a successful category of wines that has made Rioja great and famous.”
Kirsten Kilby, managing director of UK importer Armit Wines, added: “Armit Wines have been working as the exclusive importer of La Rioja Alta S.A. for almost 10 years and I am delighted that we will be the first to release this new wine worldwide. The impeccably elegant and fresh Viña Arana Gran Reserva is a testament to the incredible wine-making skills of Julio Sáenz and the team at La Rioja Alta.”

Trade in London’s Soho, a kindly priced members club for those connected to the hospitality industry, was brought into being by two star Master Sommelier operators.
A classy refuge, day and night, for an initial 800 members of the hospitality trade, who are typically “hedonistic, but not very rich,” says Xavier Rousset, co-founder with Gearoid Devaney of this bijou Frith Street members club, as well as Blandford Comptoir, Comptoir Cafe & Wine and Cabotte.
Accessed via entryphone, the nondescript matt grey frontage beside the vivid Bar Italia gives way to a potentially decadent chamber with a brushed gold ceiling (adding an extra £6,000 to the build!), framed historic menus, and well-equipped handsome bar (thanks to Speciality Drinks’ Dawn Davies MW) and authored coffee counter. The best seats are the sofas in the alcoves. GM (and keen golfer, “weather permitting”) Michael Burke (formerly of Craft and Soho House) is the urbane mine host.
Wholly repaired and refitted, the former gay members club required much TLC to remedy water ingress, and is proving a learning curve for Master Sommeliers, Rousset and Devaney. “We’ve never done a members club before and are noticing things like Monday’s busier than Saturday.” Keep an eye out for special events, such as Bloodshot, an after-hours feast by chefs for chefs created by The Dairy’s Robin Gill, who worked alongside Rousset and Devaney at Le Manoir Aux Quat’Saisons.
Rousset, who is powered by five espresso per day, says the “quirky” core list of 40 whites and 40 reds including Slovenian Malvazija, and brand new Bordeaux, “Clavis Oréa” features “hardly any classics.” There’s real excitement via the eagerly thumbed little black book, which might feature 15-year-old Côte-Rôtie (Domaine Pierre Gaillard), 20-year-old Pomerol (Château Hosanna), 25-year-old Ornellaia, and young Domain Trevallon, served in fine glassware. The sweet spot is £50-100 per bottle, at which point “the wines fly out.”
Dishes by head chef, Tony Monzó (formerly of ETM, Aubaine, and Club Gascon) are not fixed to one cuisine and may include: miso braised mushrooms on toast with raw yolk, slow-cooked, crispy suckling pig (72 hours noticed required) and crêpes Suzette.

Constellation Brands has sold around 30 of its lower priced wine brands and related facilities to E&J Gallo in a deal worth US$1.7 billion as part of a strategy to streamline and premiumise its portfolio.
The New York-based drinks producer, which is also responsible for Corona and Modelo beers, has signed a deal that will see its wine brands priced at US$11 and below sold, including Clos du Bois, Black Box, Estancia, Mark West, Wild Horse, Franciscan, and Ravenswood, along with six winemaking facilities, to E&J Gallo.
Those wineries include Mission Bell, Turner Road Vintners, Clos du Bois and Wild Horse in California, Hogue Cellars in Washington, and Canandaigua in New York.
Commenting on the sale, Joseph E. Gallo, chief executive officer of Gallo, said: “We are committed to remaining a family-owned company focused on growing the wine industry. While we continue to invest in our premium and luxury businesses, we see a tremendous opportunity with this acquisition to bring new consumers into the wine category,” adding: “We will continue to provide our customers and consumers with quality products at every price point.”
The deal follows rumours that Constellation had been preparing to sell off up to 40% of its portfolio, in February, having reported weaknesses in sales of its low-end wine business. 
The move, according to Bill Newlands, CEO and president of Constellation Brands, will allow the company to focus on its premium brands which he said are performing better in a statement confirming the deal on Wednesday.
“One of the hallmarks of our success over the years has been our ability to evolve and stay on the forefront of emerging consumer trends,” said Newlands.
“This decision will help enhance organizational focus on a more premium set of wine and spirits brands that better position our company to drive accelerated growth and shareholder value. In turn, Gallo is acquiring a collection of great brands that complement their operational model and business strategy to provide quality products to consumers at every price point.”
Constellation’s remaining wine and spirits portfolio includes: Robert Mondavi; The Prisoner Wine Company; Kim Crawford; Ruffino; Meiomi; and SVEDKA Vodka, as well as high-end brands like Schrader Cellars, Mount Veeder Winery, Casa Noble Tequila and High West Whiskey, among others.
The deal follows Constellation’s near $4 billion additional investment in Canadian cannabis company Canopy Growth last year, pushing its stake to 38%. The company acquired its initial stake in October last year for £141 million (US$179m), back when, according to the Wall Street Journal, Canopy Growth had a market value of £1.3 billion (US$1.6bn).
The transaction is subject to closing conditions and regulatory approval, and is expected to close at the end of the first quarter of the 2020 financial year.

US wine auctioneer Acker Merrall & Condit has announced it intends to rebrand simply as ‘Acker’, ahead of the company’s 200th anniversary next year.
The rebrand is part of a “year of dynamic change” the auction house announced in a statement this week, including its first spirits only auction next month.
Last year the auctioneer realised US$125 million in sales, taking total sales since its auction arm began to over US$1bn the company said.
Founded in 1820 in New York, Acker is the oldest wine shop in the US and one of the world’s largest wine auctioneers.
The house will hold its first dedicated spirits sale in Hong Kong on 11 May as well as auctions in New York on 6 April, 15 May and 19 June.

Vijay Mallya, the former head of India’s United Spirits, is being kept by his partner, personal assistant, a business acquaintance and his children, according to his formal response to a bankruptcy petition presented by 13 Indian banks.

Mallya’s lawyers told the High Court in London yesterday that he is willing to cut his spending to £29,500 a month, compared with the £18,300-a-week allowance he had been granted by the court while a global freeze on his assets remains in place.
Mallya is fighting multiple actions by his creditors in both London and India as he awaits an appeal hearing against extradition to India to face charges of fraud and money laundering.
The court was told that Mallya’s “partner/wife Pinky Lalwani” has annual income of £150,000 and that Mallya ‘s personal assets have fallen to £328 million, which he has offered to the Karnataka High Court to settle his debts.
India’s authorities have seized more than £1billion of Mallya’s assets, including multiple properties and his holding the country’s biggest beer group, United Breweries.
Despite claiming to be on his uppers, lawyers for the creditor banks said Mallya continues to live a “lavish lifestyle,” and “is suffering no real hardship as would be understood by the man on the street”.
They said he has other sources of income including a £7,500 monthly payment from Kingfisher Beer Europe Ltd. and his family’s wealth, much of which is tied up in trusts.
In his defence, Mallya’s counsel told the court: “Dr. Mallya continues to do all he can to support a court process in India which should see creditors paid off in full……. Dr. Mallya meanwhile lives well within the court-ordered limits and looks forward to its [the bankruptcy petition’s] conclusion in the coming months.”
The full court hearing is scheduled for December.

Loyal supporters
db would never have reached 100 issues, let alone 200, without the support of brand owners in this business, and we are particularly pleased to see that so many of the partners that featured in our first ever edition of the magazine are still working with us today. Among such longstanding supporters are major players in the world of Champagne and Spain, with producers in Rioja proving particularly loyal. Indeed, both Marqués de Cáceres and Campo Viejo – the two power brands of this region – featured in issue 1 and this, the 200th copy of db. Testament to their strength, and the enduring appeal of this region, the president of Marqués de Cáceres reminds db readers how much the competition for the classic wines of Europe has intensified during this century. Nevertheless, the top drops of Rioja have retained their relevance, enticing a new generation of wine drinkers. For Campo Viejo, a cornerstone to this brand’s strength relates to its early adoption of sustainable approaches to production, and, it was not long after db launched that this famous Rioja brand completed a new winery, which was one of the first in the world to follow the principles of sustainable architecture, seamlessly integrated with the environment. Laying the groundwork ahead of a forecasted rise in demand for sustainable drinks, Campo Viejo was also Spain’s first winery to be certified Carbon Neutral in 2012. And, such a green focus has been recognised today, with Campo Viejo receiving a ‘Sustainability Award’ in the 2018 Green Awards by the drinks business, which you can read about in our January edition.


It’s been 200 issues since the drinks business arrived onto the scene. Published monthly, we’ve been producing magazines since July 2002, and with an average pagination of around 100 sheets in each edition, we must have printed 200,000 pages of drinks-related news and comment since we started – representing at least 100 million words.
That’s without including our Hong Kong magazine – launched in October 2011, or our website, which went live in January 2006, making it an essential news resource for the global drinks industry for more than 13 years.
the drinks business has developed significantly since issue one, notably from a monthly magazine into a powerful multi-media brand in the beer, wine and spirits trade. It has achieved this since its first edition, which was published in July 2002, through the development of its awards, designed to recognise and reward excellence in drinks; its numerous special reports on trends, sectors and countries; and its powerful online presence, along with its events and masterclasses for both trade and consumer audiences, and finally, its blind-tasting competitions, called the Global Masters.
Today, we proudly state that db is the world’s leading print, online and social media channel for dedicated news and objective editorial covering the wine, beer and spirits sector. Despite reaching such a stage in our development, db is constantly improving its offer, as well as expanding its reach. Among the publishing brand’s most recent launches is a website dedicated entirely to our Global Masters tasting competitions: theglobalmasters.co.uk.
Not long before this, we unveiled a further website, along with a printed guide, devoted to rating restaurant wine lists, called Wine List Confidential. This was augmented at the start of this year with a run-down of London’s top 50 most influential sommeliers. As for the future, the end of this year will see db celebrate the world’s best winemakers, with both a printed guide and an event, which will reward the top performers from our Global Masters competitions.
So, how should we mark this milestone edition? We have settled on a set of themes, each supported by a medal-winning wine from our Global Wine Masters.
Such subjects represent 10 areas of the wine trade that have changed beyond recognition since we started. If you like, these are the defining drinks of our century so far.

The city of Christchurch on New Zealand’s South Island will host the next NZ Pinot Noir celebration in 2021, the first time the event will have been held in the city in its 20-year history.
Cathedral square in Christchurch, New Zealand.
Pinot Noir NZ was established in 2001 with the aim of bringing the world of Pinot Noir to New Zealand by creating an experience to “showcase everything unique about growing Pinot in Aotearoa”.
The three-day celebration is held every four years, when more than 100 New Zealand Pinot Noir producers gather, along with Pinot enthusiasts, journalists and members of the trade, to explore the country’s most popular red variety.
The last event was held in 2017 on Wellington’s waterfront and was attended by industry professional including Jancis Robinson MW, Andrea Frost and Elaine Chukan Brown.
Pinot Noir NZ 2021, which will be the sixth in its history and will also mark its 20th anniversary, will build on the 2017 event with the ongoing aim of positioning New Zealand Pinot Noir producers as international leaders of the notoriously pernickety grape variety.
“The New Zealand wine industry is becoming mature and confident, comfortable about who we are and how we talk about ourselves,” said Pinot Noir 2021 co-chair Helen Masters, winemaker at Ata Rangi in Martinborough, and NZ Winemaker of the Year 2019.
“New Zealand’s continual innovation in grape growing, winemaking and industry-wide sustainability attracts great interest on the world stage.”
For the first time in its 20-year history, the event will be hosted in Christchurch, with the committee organising a packed programme in celebration of Pinot Noir, featuring tastings, seminars and events in venues across the central city, alongside new branding.
Helen Masters explained “The committee considered a number of venues for Pinot Noir 2021, but Christchurch really stood out for its energy and collaborative approach. It’s a fascinating city, the speed with which it’s evolving makes it an extraordinary destination for our guests to explore.
“It’s also a natural mid-point for our Pinot Noir growing regions in the North and South islands. Following the appalling terrorist attack in Christchurch on Friday 15 March, we are even more committed to showing our support for the city.”
Pinot Noir 2021 will run from 23rd to the 25th of February. For more info visit pinotnz.co.nz

Having been by far the dominant Liv-ex index of the past few years, the Burgundy 150 stumbled again in March, declining 2.3%.
A part of the Fine Wine 1000, the broadest measure of the market, the Burgundy 150 is showing signs of slowing after a powerhouse performance over the last five years.
It declined 2.29% last month after a decline of 3% in February as well.
It is now down 5.6% on the year-to-date. It’s still up 22% over the course of a year and 93% over the last five but perhaps Burgundy prices have finally got a bit toppy in a market that is settling back a little bit at the moment – as witnessed by the Fine Wine 100’s performance as well.
Pretty much all of the sub-indices of the FW1000 declined to some extent last month with the exception of the Champagne 50 and Italy 100 which each rose a little over 1%.
The index as a whole declined 1.3% in March after a 3% dip in February. These declined have reversed a quite extraordinary run of growth for the FW1000 which has been rising fairly constantly since early 2016.
Neither the Fine Wine 100 or 1000 have shown any positive performances so far this year.

The US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has set up a cannabis working group to work out how to regulate the sale and marketing of cannabis-infused food and drinks, and is asking for feedback from stake-holders.
The FDA said it remained “committed to exploring an appropriate, efficient and predictable regulatory framework to allow product developers that meet the requirements under our authorities to lawfully market these types of products”.
It has announced a public hearing on 31 May that will allow stakeholders to share their experience and challenges with products containing cannabis and compounds derived from it as well as provide feedback on the existing regulation, in order to move forward on regulation, marketing and labelling.
According to CNBC, the FDA has already been searching for a solution, following calls from Congress.
In a statement on the FDA website, outgoing FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said it was “critical” to address unanswered questions about CBD and other cannabis and cannabis-derived products in order to inform its regulation on these products.
He confirmed that the high-level working group will “explore potential pathways for dietary supplements and/or conventional foods containing CBD to be lawfully marketed; including a consideration of what statutory or regulatory changes might be needed and what the impact of such marketing would be on the public health.”
He said stakeholders were looking to the FDA for clarity, particularly after Congress passed the Agriculture Improvement Act (Farm Bill), which removed hemp (an almost identical plant that does not contain the psychoactive compound Tetrahydrocannabinol or THC) from the schedule 1 of controlled substances Act, but maintained the FDA  should still regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds.
“We recognize that stakeholders are looking to the FDA for clarity on how our authorities apply to such products, what pathways are available to market such products lawfully under these authorities, and how the FDA is carrying out its responsibility to protect public health and safety with respect to such products,” he said.
“This is a complicated topic and we expect that it could take some time to resolve fully. Nevertheless, we’re deeply focused on this issue and committed to continuing to engage relevant stakeholders as we consider potential paths forward.”
The working group is expected to share its findings as early as this summer, Gottlieb said.
The US cannabis drinks industry was worth around $86 million last year, according to the CBD Drinks Report, which was published by drinks experts Zenith Global and Beverage Digest in February, but sales are likely to pass the $1 billion barrier in 2023.
It comes off the back of loosening regulation which has increased the rate of innovation in cannabis-infused drinks with companies such as Constellation Brands, investing in cannabis start-ups and developing products infused with the drug.

"Familia Torres has outlined further plans for its projects in Priorat including a new classification for ‘old vines’ and a new vineyard being planted at over 700 metres, having just released a new single vineyard wine from the region named ‘Mas de la Rosa’."," 4th April, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/04/torres-lays-out-plans-for-priorat-projects/,"4th April, 2019

Familia Torres has outlined further plans for its projects in Priorat including a new classification for ‘old vines’ and a new vineyard being planted at over 700 metres, having just released a new single vineyard wine from the region named ‘Mas de la Rosa’.
Yesterday (3 April) saw Torres unveil its newest single site wine in the UK, the Mas de la Rosa 2016 (Celler Val Llach also produces a ‘Mas de la Rosa’ as well).
Introduced by Migeul Torres Maczassek at a tasting of the new vintages from the company’s ‘Antologia’ and ‘Iconic’ range of wines, Mas de la Rosa represents another stage in the on-going attention that Torres has been putting into the Catalonian region, which until now only included the ‘Perpetual’ label using fruit sourced from old vines across the region.
The 1.8 hectare plot is located at 500 metres above sea level near the town of Porrera, and is planted with Garnacha and Cariñena (Grenache and Carignan) dating to 1939-1940.
Torres said that the company had worked with the site’s original owner, Manolo del Aguila Ruiz, for a number of years before buying his part of the vineyard but Ruiz still takes an active part in tending the vines – all of which has to be done by hand due to the goblet trained vines and its situation.
Just under 2,000 bottles and 160 magnums were produced in the 2016 vintage where average yields were 300 grams of fruit per vine and only some 60 bottles with an estimated retail price of over £200 each will be available in the UK through Torres’ agents Fells.
In addition, Torres revealed that the company was currently planting a small half-hectare plot on the nearby Els Tossals where it has purchased 15ha of land in total.
It is apparently the highest point in Priorat where slate can still be found in the soil and it used to be planted with vines until the region suffered its severe contraction at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries.
At 750m above sea level however it is a very cold spot, as much as 5˚C cooler than in Porrera. On the other hand, Torres said that with one eye on climate change, cooler vineyards at higher elevation could be a vital resource.
Although only half a hectare of Garnacha and Cariñena have been planted so far, Torres said “we hope to increase it” but added it would be “a long process”.
Finally, he said that later this month he and some other growers were going to put it to the region’s governing body that any mention of ‘old vines’ (Vinyes velles) can only refer to vines that are at least 75 years old.
As he explained, this classification is designed to help protect old vines which are too often the first to be uprooted by growers that view them as unprofitable due to the low yields they give.
“We want growers to respect and pay more for fruit [from these vines] to make them more valuable,” he said.

New horizons (and heights) in viticulture were reached this week (1-5 April) with the planting of the first two of five small vineyards in the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan.
The first vineyard is planted at Yusipang. Photo cred: Bhutan Wine
The two vineyards will soon be joined by three more next week and although altogether they will cover just six acres the plan is to gradually expand them as the right sites and varieties reveal themselves.
The project is the brainchild of American MW student Mike Juergens who first went to Bhutan to run a marathon and noticed that the conditions could be “ideal for wine”, with there being lots of south-facing slopes and iron-rich soils (among other criteria).
As he explained to the drinks business, at a dinner with government officials that same trip he asked if there were any vines planted in the country and was told there were not.
Juergens laid out why he thought the country would suit viticulture and, once home, after some further research he wrote a white paper for the government to follow up on (Juergens is a partner at a “global consultancy firm”).
A third party validated the paper and said it would work but nothing happened until Juergens returned for another marathon and found more people interested in his idea. Having written a business plan for them they then asked, ‘would you help us?’.
For Juergens this represented a “glorious opportunity”. Living in California he explained there was always the possibility of planting his own vineyard. This, however, was something quite different; a country entirely devoid of viticultural heritage (or baggage)* – which holds, Juergens believes “ridiculous potential” –where the industry was starting entirely from scratch.
‘To be able to build not just a vineyard but a whole region,” he said. “It was way too good an adventure [to pass up].”
The next few years were spent in consultation with the Bhutanese authorities as well as finding a nursery to source plants from – and Juergens said that emailing nurseries to tell them you’re setting up a vineyard in Bhutan was often treated in much the same way that emails from ‘Nigerian princes’ are.
Eventually a nursery partner was found in the US however and nine varieties (and various rootstocks) chosen for the initial plantings: Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Pinot Noir, Malbec, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Petit Manseng.
The vineyards are located at various places around the country to take advantage of the various climates that Bhutan offers and see what works best were. Juergens explained that they were, “trying vineyard styles from terraces to flat and with all these different things in play we hope we’ll dial in quickly on what is working and then change accordingly.”
As a mountain country, Bhutan offers elevations from 1,000 feet up to 23,000ft and with it dramatic changes in conditions ranging from fairly temperate to tropical. The highest vineyard that will be planted is at 2,700 metres above sea level, not quite the highest in the world – those are still in Argentina (for now). Juergens said it would be possible to find ‘the highest’ point but it would be more of a marketing ploy rather than a practical venture so he wasn’t interested.
Juergens was also quite clear that, “not everything we’ve bought is going to work,” but he was “highly optimistic” it would be a success and he was already had in mind certain places that he thinks will prove themselves suited to red grapes and a few for whites.
As well as his faith in the climate, another factor is the Bhutanese themselves. “If there’s one thing the Bhutanese are good at it’s agriculture,” said Juergens. “Their site prep was as good as I’ve ever seen in the world.”
And in addition to the people is the relatively pristine nature of the land itself. Bhutan is a carbon neutral country, “revered” for its sustainable practices and on-track to being 100% organic. As such the need for clean planting material was vital as Juergens did not intend to be the first person to, “roll in there and f*ck it up.”
On the other hand, there are very few pests on any of the other crops in Bhutan, the often dry conditions with good breezes should naturally combat mildew and there is no esca or flavesence dorée or any other moths, molds, critters or fungi that are attacking vines elsewhere in the world.
“It’s completely untapped,” said Juergens “and it’s protected on all sides by mountains. If you’re a phylloxera louse it’s pretty hard to sneak over K2 to snack on a vine.”
The only forseeable problems will be birds and frost – unless there’s some abominable vine disease in Bhutan that hasn’t been discovered yet and if there is, Juergens joked he’d at least be known for that.
All that considered, the vines will therefore be worked organically with Juergens – though not a committed ‘disciple’ of Steiner – keen to incorporate some elements of biodynamics as well – principles he also thinks would be readily appreciated by the Bhutanese themselves and their philosophy of agriculture.

But vineyards are only half the battle as there are no wineries in Bhutan either. The Bhutanese make their own rice wines, each family having a “secret” recipe that they guard jealously and Juergens says that locally made peach wines have become popular in recent year.
The only thing approaching wine made in the country is by the army who import bulk wine from India and, more recently, South Africa which is then bottled and sold with the proceeds going towards supporting retired veterans.
No winery, no problem though says Juergens who said: “I’m going to build a winery”.
He hasn’t decided quite where yet, much again will depend on which vineyards look like they’re going to be the most viable and that won’t be known for a few years.
Another hurdle is the lack of winemaking knowledge in the country. While Juergens said he wasn’t so keen on getting in a consultant because that would mean paying someone “to make an educated guess”, he will be looking to bring in a team “of vineyard folks to help with knowledge transfer”, once the successful vineyards have been identified.
Although Juergens said he’s looking into introducing vines to smallholders – of which there are many in Bhutan – and creating a small co-operative system that might lead to a slightly larger base for the industry, the main focus is going to be on terroir-focused wines (Juergens says the wine will be labelled ‘Thunder Dragon’), “you could drink in New York”.
As Juergens said: “There are a range of microclimates and the idea is to produce terroir wines not bulk. I’m not interested in $5 bottles of plonk. We really want to dial in on terroirs and leverage those. This is a long-term project. We’re picking top quality sites.”
It will of course be a “challenge” but, as Juergens saw from the beginning, it’s also, “a chance to make something truly unique on the global wine stage.”
All it needs now, is a bit of time.

Pernod Ricard has unveiled a new long-term sustainability strategy that will see it ban single-use plastic, commit to 100% recyclable or compostable packaging, slash its carbon footprint and implement gender balance in its top management teams by 2030.
The new strategy, unveiled at the company’s Martel distillery in Cognac yesterday, lays out eight ambitious targets in four key areas, which include nurturing its terroir and boosting biodiversity, valuing people through increasing diversity and training, minimising waste and creating a circular economy and fighting alcohol misuse though responsible hosting.
CEO Alexandre Ricard said it was the “perfect time” to set very ambitious goals in all aspects of its business and the company would continue to build for the longer-term.
The ‘Good Times form a Good Place’ initiative will see changes implemented to respond to the challenges of climate change, including formulating strategic biodiversity for all of the Group’s global affiliates, and developing regenerative projects in vineyards in 8 different wine regions – Argentina, California, Cognac, Champagne, Spain, Australia, New Zealand and China by 2030. This is aimed at mimicking natural processes to improve the quality of top soil, watershed (the land that drains into rivers and lakes) and the wider ecosystem.
As part of its plans for valuing people, it has pledged to ensure equal pay across the business by 2022, and ensure the top management teams are gender balanced by 2030. Training is also on the agenda, with ‘future-fit training” being provide to its staff at least every 3 years to develop new skills, and training for 10,000 bartenders to work in a more sustainable way, by being anti-waste and plastic-free.
It also plans to ban all promotional items made from single-use plastic, and ensure 100% of its packaging is recyclable, compostable, reusable or bio-based by 2025, as well as piloting initiatives to boost recycling rates in its top 10 largest markets with low recycling levels.
Finally it will boost its commitment to responsible drinking though its Responsible Party program and new program to fight alcohol misuse.
Vanessa Wright, VP sustainability & responsibility, who oversaw the company’s decision to ban single-use straws in January 2018, will lead the overall project.
She said the customers expected the company’s brands to be responsible and respectful of the environment and although this had been embedded in the company’s ethos, the new roadmap helped place the responsibility right across all areas of the business.
“These 2030 commitments provide us with a focused framework across our business in helping to address some of the biggest sustainability issues, so consumers can enjoy our products in a convivial and sustainable way,” she said.
She added that the company needed to make sure it was responsible in the way it put together its communications and marketing campaigns.  “That means really exploring creative routes to break stereotypes, which is something that we’ll be looking at by at least by 2023,” she said.

The Vinitaly International Academy (VIA) has welcomed 23 new ambassadors and one new expert to its international community after its five-day course in March this year.
The course, which began on 29 March and ended on 2 April, saw new ambassadors and an expert welcomed into the VIA community, hailing from countries including Sweden, the UK, Ireland, the US, Japan, Italy, France, Poland, Hong Kong, UAE, Mexico, Australia and Switzerland.
Organised by Veronafiere and Vinitaly International with the support of ICE – the Italian Trade Agency – the VIA Italian Wine Ambassador course took place in Verona and saw 62 wine professionals from 22 different countries participate.
Commenting on the news, Stevie Kim, managing director of Vinitaly International, said: “The VIA Verona edition of 2019 was a bumper crop. The selection for our flagship course is very competitive and we have the privilege of choosing among the best pool of highly-qualified professionals. Overall, we now have 204 certified Italian Wine Ambassadors and Experts.
“It is important to underline that nearly 560 candidates have gone through the course to date and by the end of 2019 we estimate that the number of course participants will reach 800.”
The course, which has recently been restructured, has been taken to Hong Kong, Los Angeles and Chengdu, returning for its flagship edition in Verona to coincide with the start of Vinitaly.
This year’s intake included a high proportion of buyers, importers and sommeliers. Participants had the opportunity to taste 320 wines over four days of the course and listened to presentations from the VIA team.
Newly-appointed Italian Wine Ambassador and US-based sommelier Jennifer Burgess said: “I am absolutely amazed about how in-depth we are going into a few different areas, particularly with the soil structure. I find that we are getting a lot more of information that I have had access to in prior courses. I find the walk-around tastings really amazing: to have the opportunity to try as many wines that we are trying and to compare and contrast as many different varieties coming from different parts of Italy or from different producers, and generally the depth of information. I found this to be an exceptional course.”
Fellow Italian Wine Ambassador Annette Lizotte, originally from Sweden, added: “I really appreciated how the course put together all the different aspects: the history of the country and the history of wine-making in general. So, grape by grape, I started to discover a completely new aspect of Italy that I didn’t know, even after living here for 14 years, after working in the wine business, and after my sommelier education. And it is fantastic to share the knowledge and the tasting notes with people from all over the world that are passionate about Italian wine. This is something really special. Also, the possibility to taste the wines that we don’t get in the countries where we live – there are some grape varieties and related wines that haven’t arrived in Sweden yet – this was really something fantastic.”

Former River Café chef Theo Hill will open his first solo venture called Gold in London’s Notting Hill this spring, offering a modern European menu with an Italian focus.

Led by Theo Hill, the chef will be joined by Alex Ghalleb and Arez Akgundogdu, formerly of the Soho House group.
The new neighbourhood restaurant and bar will open on the site formerly occupied by the pub Portobello Gold on Portobello Road in west London’s Notting Hill.
The menu promises to feature plates designed to share that “exude colour, taste, and modern freshness, with a focus on produce-led, minimal process cooking,” including a whole sea bream with wild oregano and capers; burrata garnished with charred pears, Parma ham, radicchio, and balsamic vinegar; wood-roasted cauliflower with toasted buckwheat, cumin, yoghurt, and coriander; and nettle ravioli consisting of sheep’s ricotta and sorrel.
The four-floor space will include a bar, open kitchen and garden room featuring trees and a retractable roof, with further dining areas and a private dining room on the upper floors.
The “Modern bohemian interiors, from local architect and design duo Felix and Valerie von Bechtolsheim, will draw on Portobello’s once-thriving industrial past to create a restaurant and bar that is both informal and open” inspired by the artists, designers and musicians of Notting Hill.
Portuguese artist Vhils has been commissioned to create a series of works, one of which will cover the exterior of the restaurant.
Gold opens in May.

2018 is an exceptional vintage.

2018 is an exceptional vintage. But it is one that is more heterogeneous in quality than either 2015 or 2016 and whose greatness and unevenness are defined by the challenge of global warming.
As I reported this time last year, Bordeaux 2017 was a vintage defined by the frost – its presence and its uneven distribution (within and between vineyards). 2018 is also a vintage defined by climatic challenges – but not in the same way, nor ultimately to the same extent. And unlike its immediate predecessor, 2018 is an undoubtedly great vintage, richly deserving of it place in the recent pantheon of qualitative greats: 2005, 2009, 2010, 2015 and 2016.
But, having just returned from the week of the Bordeaux en primeur tastings, what is striking is that this is a more complex and, in the end, a more heterogeneous vintage than perhaps any of these other recent greats.
To understand why is to understand the climatic challenge that needed to be negotiated both in the vineyard and in the chai – and the extent to which that challenge was met.
First, the good news. In practically every property that I visited, the vines recovered well from last year’s intense frost. Anxieties about damage over the two-year vegetative cycle proved largely unfounded. Potential yields were reduced by a number of factors, but the lingering consequences of last year’s frost damage were not among them.
Indeed, as Julie Guinaudeau explained at Château Lafleur, the mild and early spring led to an early bud burst and prolific early growth. Things had started well. Yet this was in fact a precursor for what would turn out to be the biggest challenge of the vintage.
For between March and June an average of 361mm of rain fell in the region – over 80% of the rain that fell in the entire growing season. March alone saw 126mm of rain, almost exactly double the 30-year average. This, in combination with the precocious and mild spring, led downy mildew to spread like wildfire through untreated or late-treated vineyards (as it was doing in other regions of France, notably the Rhône valley where producers tend to trust to the Mistral to keep it at bay).
The result was potentially devastating – the 2018 equivalent of the frosts that had ravaged vineyards almost exactly a year earlier. But, unlike the frost in the preceding vintage, this time the best terroirs were not spared and the problems were greatest in vineyards managed organically or biodynamically. The authorised treatments were simply no match.
As this suggests, the damage was spread very unevenly. Least effected were the airy, wind-dried côtes of St Emilion and the extreme north of the Médoc; Petit Verdot (typically grown in the largest quantities in the southern Médoc) was also partially spared, leading to some unusual final blends (in the Margaux appellation in particular).
Worst effected, of course, were organic and biodynamically farmed vineyards – with Châteaux Palmer and Pontet Canet reduced to miniscule yields of 11 hl/ha and 8 hl/ha respectively and with Château Angludet (in Margaux) tragically losing 90% of its potential yield (after suffering the loss of its entire crop to frost in 2017).
Yet mildew was not the only climatic threat to the vintage. The next problem came not from the ground, but from the heavens – in the form of the intense if localised hail that has become a perennial threat in recent vintages. On 26 May, it was the vineyards of Bourg, Blaye and parts of the lower Médoc and Pessac-Léognan that were hit – with the entire production of Château La Lagune (in the southern-most part of the Haut-Médoc) wiped out by hailstones “the size of pigeons’ eggs”, as Caroline Frey put it, and with considerable damage in the vineyards of a number of Médoc and Pessac classed growths (including Cantemerle and Smith Haut Laffite).
And almost two months later, on 15 July (as France were winning the World Cup Final) hail again ravaged parts of the region. This time Sauternes was the principal appellation to be affected (though Bourg and parts of the Haut-Médoc were hit for a second time), with Château Guiraud’s entire production being wiped out while neighbouring Château d’Yquem was only narrowly spared.
Yet, this localized explosion from the heavens notwithstanding, July brought relief from the rain that had thus far characterised the year. It ushered in one of the longest and driest summers on record (with a mere 82mm of rain falling between July and the end of September). The transformation was as remarkable as it was timely – and it saved the vintage.
But there is another – perhaps more alarming – way of looking at this. For 2018 was a summer that, in the absence of the monsoon conditions of the early spring, would have led to very significant (and vintage-threatening) hydric stress in the vineyard.
In other words, the only way that the spring and early summer of 2018 could turn out well was if it were followed by such an exceptional and long late summer; and, conversely, the only way that a summer like 2018 could have turned out well was for it to be preceded by a monsoon spring. On such fine climatic margins are great vintages now made.
In a way, and despite its considerable challenges, Bordeaux 2018 is a ‘miracle’ vintage – a phrase repeated many times during the en primeur tastings. It was saved, in effect, by global warming from global warming.
But that makes it worrying when placed in a longer-term perspective. For with global climate change vintage-threatening risks proliferate. The unevenness of rainfall across the year is increasing; the likelihood of early bud-break exposing vineyards to the risk of hail and frost damage is rising; average summer temperatures are rising; average summer rainfall is falling; and violent hail storms are more prevalent.
With the exception of frost, 2018 saw each effect in play. This is the ‘new normal’; and the new normal may well make exceptional vintages less frequent.
But in 2018 circumstances conspired to produce optimal ripeness. As Sébastien Vergne explained to us at Château Margaux, the long, languid Indian summer saw alcohol levels peak in late August and early September and then plateau.
This allowed picking to be done, row by row, parcel by parcel, over the period of an entire month – with full maturation of the tannins and tiny grapes concentrated by mild hydric stress and a rather windy September. The results are spectacular, at Château Margaux and more generally.
So what of the wines themselves? In future pieces on the Médoc, the Right Bank, I will try to paint a more complex and nuanced picture of the vintage.
But, in general terms, this is an exceptional yet distinctive year. It is also neither a ‘Left Bank’ nor a ‘Right Bank’ vintage. Excellence is to be found in both.
Alcohol levels are undoubtedly high but in the majority of cases and certainly from the best terroirs they are adequately compensated by the freshness that comes with higher levels of acidity.
Where this is reinforced by restrained and intelligent wine-making the results are truly fantastic. The top wines, really in each appellation, are as good as any en primeur samples I have tasted in recent years. The quality of the gloriously opulent and svelte tannins is remarkable, drawing comparisons with 2016 and making many of these wines approachable even now. The vintage is rich, plump, plush, powerful and intensely structured.
But there were pitfalls too. Over-extraction, over-ripeness, alcoholic ‘heat’, and even a hint of residual sugar marred many samples and masked many terroirs. The succulence of the tannins allied with the power and concentration of these wines at times lead to a certain soupy heaviness and a lack of precision and finesse.
In 2018, freshness is the key. Where it has been captured the wines are extraordinarily elegant and lithe, yet dynamic and energetic – more so than in 2016 in my view.
But where it is absent, the wines taste one-dimensional and lacking in terroir expression, interest and singularity. The highs are very high indeed; but not everyone got this tricky vintage right.
Though it is very difficult to generalise, in the Médoc the very best wines tended to come from St Julien (probably the most consistent appellation in 2018) and St Estèphe – though Pauillac, too, produced some glittering successes (notably among its first and second growths).
On the Right Bank it was the wines from the limestone côtes of St Emilion and from Pomerol that were most fêted – and which retained most freshness. Particularly impressive were those wines with a good proportion of Cabernet Franc and/or Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend.
Finally, 2018 is much more of a red than a white wine vintage. Sémillon, in particular, suffered in the summer sun, producing wines that are just a little too fat, just a little too alcoholic and just a little too lacking in freshness and precision.
The exceptions, then, are wines made exclusively from Sauvignon Blanc – such as Pavillon Blanc de Château Margaux and Les Champs Libres (from the Guinaudeau family of Château Lafleur) – and those with an unusually high share of Sauvignon in the bland – such as the wonderfully exotic Château Haut-Brion blanc.
In short, there are plenty of fantastic wines to be found in Bordeaux 2018; but freshness is the key and you have to go looking for it.

Scotch whisky brand Johnnie Walker has submitted plans to enhance the “visitor experiences” at its Cardhu and Clynelish distilleries.
The plans are part of brand owner Diageo’s £150 million investment in the Johnnie Walker brand, which also include a visitor centre in Edinburgh.
Cardhu will become the “Speyside home” of Johnnie Walker and Clynelish the “Highland home” according to a statement.
At Cardhu there are plans for “significant” new landscaping around the distillery, including the planting of an orchard.
Laura Sharp, Cardhu Distillery’s brand home manager, said: “This is an important step in our plans for the distillery. We have already shared our initial plans with the local community and now we look forward to working with local stakeholders as we progress the planning process.
“Speyside a hugely important part of the Scotch whisky tourism map and we are very excited by the plans for Cardhu, which we believe will bring new visitors to the distillery and to the region.”
At Clynelish meanwhile the work will be more extensive with a new upper floor being added to the distillery for visitors and a new bar and tasting area with views of the Sutherland coast.
Jacqueline James-Bow, Clynelish Distillery’s brand home manager, said: “This is another significant milestone on our journey to transform the visitor experience at Clynelish.
“We have seen great growth in tourism over recent years with the NC500 bringing new visitors to the Highlands. We believe the investment we are making at the distillery will create a major new attraction and help bring more tourists to this part of the world in the future.”
Subject to planning permission being approved, work is expected to start later this year and be finished by late 2020.

Pernod Ricard has officially confirmed that it will take on DBR Lafite’s two popular volume brands, Legende and Saga, for the Chinese market starting from 1 July.
The news was announced today following an earlier report by dbHK that DBR Lafite had ended its exclusivity with its longtime partner in China ASC Fine Wines.
The addition of the two popular volume brands is expected to “significantly” supplement the company’s existing wine portfolio to “satisfy the rising demand of consumers,” the company says.
Its existing wine brands include Jacob’s Creek, Campo Viejo, Stoneleigh, St Hugo and Louis Latour.
DBR Lafite is known for its first growth Château Lafite Rothschild, but its mid-tier wines such as Legende and Saga have become immensely successful in China thanks to their association with Lafite.
DBR Lafite’s distribution plans in China have been much talked about and speculated as the sheer volume and brands involved for one of the most important French wine companies.
China has grown to be its key export market. The company reportedly shipped some 350,000 cases of wines to China alone in 2015.
Speaking of the company’s partnership with DBR Lafite, Jean-Etienne Gourgues, managing director of Pernod Ricard China, said: “We are honoured to be a part of this partnership. Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) is a leading French Bordeaux brand renowned for its expertise and tradition upheld for generations by the Rothschild family. Together with them, we are confident in accelerating consumer recruitment and making greater achievements here in China.”
Jean-Guillaume Prats, president of Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite), added: “Our group has been committed to providing Chinese consumers with high-quality wines full of finesse and elegance, capturing the ‘Lafite Spirit’. Likewise, Pernod Ricard China is widely recognised for its efforts in offering the most comprehensive and balanced portfolio. Sharing the same vision, we will work closely in the future and jointly promote the development of the industry as a whole.”
Meanwhile, ASC will continue to work with DBR Lafite in China. It retains exclusive distribution of DBR Lafite’s Viña Los Vascos from Chile and Domaine d’Aussieres from France in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.
“ASC and DBR Lafite have enjoyed exciting and fruitful partnership since it was forged almost a decade ago. We played an instrumental role in the development of each other, in a time when the entire wine market in China was booming in unprecedented scale and speed,” commented Yoshi Shibuya, CEO of ASC.

Pub chain operator Mitchells and Butlers (M&B)  has dominated a new report that shows on-trade brands still gathering momentum on the high street, despite the ongoing “turbulence” in the restaurant sector.
Mitchells & Butler previously launched a simpler wine range to take the “anxiety” out of wine choice
The pub and restaurant operator, which operates 17 different brands, saw its Miller & Carter brand top the list of restaurants in the CGA Stone & River Brand Momentum Report, coming out ahead of  Nando’s, Cote, Five Guys and Bella Italia for growing momentum, brand awareness and consumer loyalty. The report put this down to brand having a “quality and simplicity of offer”.
M&B also dominated the top five pub restaurant list, with four of its brands making the top five: Stonehouse Pizza & Carvey, which opened two years ago took the top spot, and upmarket pub chain Ember Inns and Vintage Inns, and Sizzling Pubs. Greene King’s Farmhouse Inns was in second spot.
However its well-known Toby Carvery brands fell in the rankings this year, along with Greene King’s Hungry Horse and Flaming Grill.
Phil Urban, chief executive officer at Mitchells & Butlers said the current outperformers in the portfolio – Miller & Carter, Nicholson’s and Ember Inns – had “consistency and longevity, performing year after year”.
High Street pubs
The top five pubs remained fairly static this year, headed by JD Wetherspoon in the top spot, appealing to a broad mass market, along with All M&B’s All Bar One, Revolution, Marston’s Pitcher and Piano, which appeal to a different demographic -“people looking for a good night out and exciting drinks” – and the Bay Restaurant Group’s Slug and Lettuce moving up to make it into the top five.
The report said the key challenge was to prove ‘authenticity’ of big brands in a saturated market.
“The lack of movement in this category demonstrates how little the large chains are changing—or, at least, how little the customer notices of their attempts to change,” the report said.
Significant turbulence
However, the report noted the “significant turbulence” in the eating and drinking out market, with many casual dining brands in particular hit with rising prices in terms of food, property and people as well as intense competition and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty.
“Consumer confidence remains uncertain and fast-changing habits, not to mention the impact of technology and delivery, are altering their brand perceptions. This is impacting both the top and bottom line,” it said.
It also warned that investment from umbrella companies in the pub restaurant sector was sometimes low, and there was danger of brands “losing their relevance”, while delivery services such as Deliveroo and Just Eat were starting to steal share from the lower end of the dining out market.
M&B’s Urban told the report that labour cost remained the main challenge “with or without a hard Brexit”.
“We need to keep growing the wage rates we pay, and I’d love to be able to accelerate that, but it does come down to affordability. We recognise that the demand for
quality people is only going to become greater. Growing your own talent is key,” he said.
The report, which at consumer’s opinions, awareness and loyalty, draws on CGA’s quarterly survey of the attitudes and habits of 5,000 nationally representative British consumers, BrandTrack, as well as data from its Outlet Index database of licensed premises.

Marks & Spencer has brought back its long-running ‘food porn’ marketing campaign for the third time, slyly recognizing the much-parodied seductive voice-over of the original ads.
The ‘Not just any food…” campaign, which originally featured the sultry voice of Northern Irish actress Dervla Kirwan seductively extolling the slow-mo close-ups of M&S food ran for six years, and was key in establishing the perception of M&S’s as a premium food and drink retailer.
The first ad, for a chocolate pudding, saw sales rise 3,500% , according to The Guardian. It was axed in 2010, although a nod to the original ad was briefly resuscitated in 2014.
The new campaign, which coincides with the retailer’s sponsorship with ITV prime-time show Britain’s Got Talent, features a series of short clips of people mimicking the original ad’s seductive voice-over in the course of their day. It was created by creative company Grey London and opens with a Transport for London announcer getting distracted by an advert of M&S.
M&S launched the #ThisIsNotJust food… was launched on Twitter and will run alongside a digital campaign.

Denbies Wine Estate, based in Surrey, has announced it will increase its winery workforce by a third by the end of 2019 as it installs new machinery which will quadruple its sparkling wine production capacity.
Denbies said the news is part of a £4 million “comprehensive investment drive” which will create multiple new job opportunities over the next three years.
It follows news that the English wine industry could potentially create up to 30,000 new jobs by 2040, according to figures from Wines of Great Britain (WineGB).
The first phase of the winery expansion was completed at the start of April this year with the installation of a fully-automated disgorging line and riddling cages.
Speaking to the drinks business last month, CEO of Denbies, Christopher White, said: “We’re now got a fully automated disgorging line, and we can process up to 5,000 bottles a day. We do a lot of contract disgorging for people now, and this investment will make us a lot more competitive.
“We made wines for about 15 other vineyards last year. We had to bring in temporary storage, which is the first time we’ve ever had to do this.
“We’re holding back greater volumes of base wine for sparkling wines to make sure we can maintain our quality and consistency. We typically hold back around 20% of production to allow for fluctuations in supply. Sometimes this is in tank and sometimes in bottle.”
The new machinery will allow the estate to increase production speed fourfold, giving it the capability to produce and process a larger amount of wine. It can now also disgorge both half bottles and magnums. Denbies is one of the few wineries in the south east to offer contract disgorging facilities, a much-needed industry requirement given the lack of winery space and winemaking facilities last year.
The estate will continue to expand into 2021, increasing both its tank capacity and its cellar storage area.
Commenting on the news, White said, “The demand for contract winemaking solutions has grown exponentially over the past 10 years with the growth of vineyard plantings in the UK.
“This new equipment will enable us to quadruple our sparkling wine production capacity by the end of 2019. Moreover, our programme of new plantings, and planned winery investments will enable us to expand, while continuing to drive the quality of our sparkling wines.
“The additional winery expansion programme will also ensure that we support growing demand for our full range of still wines, from entry level up to the premium ranges.”
Denbies is also investing in wine tourism and will open a carbon neutral 17-bedroom hotel this summer. Part of the new Vineyards of the Surrey Hills Group, the estate hopes the new accommodation will increase travel to the region. The hotel, the first vineyard hotel in the UK, will include an Orangery restaurant and will be fitted with solar pannels, tesla batteries, Enomatic wine machines, heated garden pods and a wine barrel sauna.
The winery currently attracts around 350,000 visitors each year and offers 7 miles of public footpaths.
With the first wines planted in 1986, Denbies claims to be the largest single estate vineyard in England. It has 265 acres under vine and produces a range of 16 wines and over 450,000 bottles a year. The entire Denbies estate comprises 635 acres and the winery is currently engaged in other projects such as bee and bat conservation.

Chinese spirit brand Kweichow Moutai opened with a record high share price of RMB 900 (US$134) per share on Monday (8 April), spurred on by the company’s strong performance in the first quarter of the year, with 20% growth in revenue and nearly 30% growth in net profit.
The company reported about 30% growth in net profit in first quarter of the year to RMB 11.59 billion (US$1.72 billion), the first time the company has broken the RMB 10 billion mark for profit, the Chinese baijiu company has announced.
Its company revenue also grew by 20% to RMB 20.9 billion (US$3.11 billion), passing the RMB 20 billion mark for the first time.
This marks a remarkable rebound for the baijiu distiller, which suffered sharp falls in October last year when its share dropped to RMB 550 (US$81.8) per share on the Shanghai stock exchange, dampening consumer market confidence amid China’s slowing economy.
For years, Moutai’s performance has served as a bellwether for consumer confidence. The rebound in Q1 might give some confidence back to distributors and retailers in alcohol industry across China especially in these challenging times.
In 2018, the company recorded sales revenue of RMB 75 billion, and its profit reached RMB 34 billion, up by 25%.
For 2019, the company has set a revenue target of RMB 100 billion and RMB 45 billion in profits.
Moutai rocketed to fame due to its close affinity with Chinese Communist revolutionaries. It’s frequently drunk at state banquets and most famously was enjoyed at a state dinner with American president Richard Nixon during his first visit to China in 1972.
The liquor is a popular drink within China, and Moutai is the most sought-after brand among consumers and collectors.
A bottle of ‘Lay Mau’ produced in 1935 fetched a record of RMB 10.7 million (US$1.6 million) in 2011, making it the most expensive single bottle of Moutai ever sold in China.

Diageo, the world’s largest premium alcoholic beverage group, is caught in the crossfire in a row between the European Union and the UK Treasury which could cost it £278 million in back tax.

The dispute centres on a tax scheme introduced in 2012 by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne. It involves complex “controlled foreign company rules” covering how tax is levied on interest payments on inter-company loans made by offshore subsidiaries.
After an 18-month investigation, the European Commission has ruled that Osborne’s tax scheme gave an unfair advantage to multinational companies based in the UK and has ordered the Treasury to reclaim more than £1 billion from about 50 companies including Diageo.
The EU says the scheme falls foul of its rules designed to stop big companies avoiding tax by moving profits into countries where taxes are low. It says the measures introduced by Osborne were tantamount to state aid.
Tax experts say the position is a muddle and expect either HM Treasury, the companies involved or both to make legal challenges to the Commission’s ruling.
The EU’s Competition Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager is quoted by The Sunday Times as saying: “Anti-tax avoidance rules are important to ensure that all companies pay their fair share of tax. But they must apply equally to all taxpayers. The UK gave certain multinationals a selective advantage by granting them an unfair exemption.”
In its latest interim accounts, published in January, Diageo said it was “monitoring developments” in the investigation and said that its total liability could be £278 million but that it had made no provision to meet any such bill.
At the weekend Diageo said: “We operate in accordance with UK law and are transparent about our maximum potential liability. We await the detailed decision [from the EU] and the UK government’s response in order to assess what it means for us.”
HM Treasury said it would “carefully consider” the Brussels ruling.
However, if Britain leaves the EU with a deal in the near future, the ruling from Brussels may be meaningless as the tax potentially to be collected would be due to the Treasury, not Brussels, and the government could choose not to change its position. The ruling could also be challenged if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. A long delay in Brexit could complicate matters.

"While many winegrowing nations rely on provenance and heritage to market their products to, a lack of tradition gives rosé producers the chance to win new customers, according to one industry insider."," 8th April, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/04/why-rose-wine-is-ideal-for-innovation/,"8th April, 2019

While many winegrowing nations rely on provenance and heritage to market their products to, a lack of tradition gives rosé producers the chance to win new customers, according to one industry insider.

Valerie Astier, who produces the annual Pink Rosé Festival in Cannes, France, told the drinks business that, while producers in regions with an established winemaking culture such as Bordeaux or Bourgogne are bound by certain viticultural, vinification or labelling practices, wineries making rosé wine do not face the same challenge of consumer expectations and are able to innovate.
“Of course, some places such as Provence have a very long history of making rosé, but overall we feel there’s more liberty, and more freedom for producers in this category,” Astier told db.
According to a recent report jointly published by FranceAgriMer and the Interprofessional Council of Vins de Provence, global still rosé wine consumption has grown steadily for the past 15 years (+28% between 2002 and 2017) with a very slight slowdown between 2016 and 2017. This stabilisation, Astier said, hides many differences depending on the rosés types such as in the USA (second largest world rosé consumer) where the blush rosés are slowly replaced by dry ones.
And while the biggest rosé consumers are France and the USA, the market in Asia is still small, but there are signs of future growth. In China, rosé wine sales are meagre, but they are forecast to increase by over 36% by 2019, according to estimates by Vinexpo.
A 21st century hit
When it comes to marketing, rosé wines certainly have something of an upper edge compared to their counterparts.
Rosé wine has been one of the biggest success stories of the industry in the 21st century. At the start of this century, rosé was hardly considered a serious drink, and it wasn’t a celebrity-endorsed category, but since 2002 it has become both, with A-list stars such as Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, Sarah Jessica Parker and Jon Bon Jovi launching their own labels. Famous for off-dry orangey pink offerings from the likes of Portugal and California at the start of the millennium, now it is the height of sophistication to sip bone-dry rosés, primarily from Provence, and especially in large formats, which is reflected in the French study.
Capitalising on the growing global thirst for rosé, the Pink Rosé Festival welcomes thousands of producers, buyers and hospitality professionals from across the globe. The event follows a similar structure to Prowein in Dusseldorf. At Pink Rosé Festival, each producer has a minimum of 16 appointments, each one lasting 30 minutes and is held over two full days with a set schedule, enabling both the producer and buyer to meet according to their pre-set agendas.
Astier told db that, ultimately, the aim for the Pink Rosé Festival is collate more studies on rosé wine sales and consumption from other nations where production is significant, such as Italy and the US.
“We want to be a platform for the rosé market,” she said. While the festival already provides an opportunity for producers and buyers to convene, the festival group’s ambition, she said, is to create a universal information database for rosé producers as consumption continues to rise in other parts of the world and shift from sweet blush styles to bone-dry and age-worthy expressions.
Transparency trends
The event’s third annual design awards took place this February. All three finalists, Astier told db, steered well away from traditional paper labelling, instead opting for glass bottles either embossed or lightly engraved that offer a tactile point of difference. In fact, six out of the top 10 winners in the competition were singled out for their “obviously these are not big numbers, the trend is so obvious that of course it means something.”
 Astier said that, owing to the variations in colour rosé wine can have, from deep pinks to pale salmon, producers can create a unique selling point and premium feel for their wines through packaging alone, “that’s why the design awards are such an important part of our festival.”
Transparency is one of the major trends in the rosé category when it comes to product packaging, not only with the bottles themselves but also in the use of closures, Astier said. Each of the top three winners (Cuvée Irrésistible – Vignobles Jolivet from Bordeaux; Cuvée Roseline Prestige – Château Sainte Roseline from Provence and the Cuvée Grezan – Château Grezan from Faugères) used glass caps, creating “spectacularly transparent” effects.

Scottish craft beer giant Brewdog has announced the acquisition of a 100-hectolitre brewery, bottling line and taproom in Berlin, formerly owned by California-based Stone Brewing.
The brewery, housed in a building that dates to 1901, is based in the Mariendorf area of Berlin and was originally opened by the American brewery in 2016.
Brewdog will officially take ownership on 1 May and said in a statement that it will close the site for a short period in order to turn the building “into a Brewdog space, similar to the vibe we have created at our Columbus brewery.”
The brewery also includes a canning line, 10 hectolitre pilot system, 2,500m2 tap room, 13m high glass wall to the brewery and 5,000m2 of outdoor gardens for enjoying a beer outside.
Brewdog has announced that it will be launching the ‘Berlin Craft Collective’ in the 10HL pilot brewery at the Mariendorf site, offering the facilities to Berlin-based craft brewers to help them start up or scale up their businesses. The brewer said it will then showcase their beers at its bars in Germany.
Brewdog has had a bar in Berlin since 2017 and will be opening a site in Hamburg this year.
It first started working with Stone Brewing in 2007 and the two brewers have collaborated many times over the years.
Commenting on the reasons for selling the site to Brewdog, co-founder and executive chairman of Stone Brewing, Greg Koch, said: “Ultimately the project turned out to be too big, too bold and too early in our growth curve in Europe. Sure, in hindsight maybe we should have started smaller, aimed for the treeline instead of the stars.
“Today we lick a few wounds, but count our successes too. We are not leaving Germany. Or Europe. We’ve met a whole new country and continent of craft beer fans! Our distribution to more than 30 European countries will continue to grow.
“Stone Brewing Tap Room – Prenzlauer Berg is still very much open, and pints will still flow.  We stand proud, and are heartened that we can pass the Mariendorf beer temple into the capable hands of our friends at BrewDog. They will do great things. And from time to time, as we’ve done in the past, we’ll do some of those great things together.”
While admitting that Stone should perhaps have chosen a different site, he said the state of the construction industry in Berlin further complicated matters.
“We invested a significant portion of a decade and significant millions building Stone Berlin. And it didn’t work out. These things hurt and these things happen. This one happened. And this one hurts a lot,” he added.
“Stone Berlin was one of the most difficult and frustrating things I’ve ever done. Yet, against professional counsel, I’m going to express one very specific frustration with Berlin. I say this because I love the city, and want it to thrive.
“The truth is, the construction industry in Berlin is broken. The real challenge was the tendency of our contractors to stop everything when a problem arose.
“Any time you attempt to build something with the size and scope of Stone Berlin, you’re going to run into unexpected challenges. We always keep moving, keep working.
“Our Berlin contractors simply couldn’t or wouldn’t do this. It cost us dearly. After talking with fellow business owners in Berlin, seems we’re not alone in that experience.
“There, I said it. At the end of the day, the responsibility falls on me. That’s my job. I take the bullet.”

Founders of Asian-inspired Hackney restaurant Pidgin are set to launch a new sandwich, soft serve, craft beer and cocktail shop in King’s Cross development Coal Drop’s Yard this summer, called Sons and Daughters.
The eatery will be the third venture to be opened by James Ramsden and Sam Herlihy.  The pair opened fine-dining concept Pidgin in 2015, known for its tasting menu which changes weekly, followed by Magpie in Mayfair, which closed last month following issues with footfall.
Son and Daughters will join restaurants including Barrafina and Le Café Alain Ducasse at the new food and retail development in King’s Cross.
Herlihy says that Sons and Daughters will be a “fast-casual sandwich bar from the team behind award-winning restaurants Pidgin and Magpie. All of our sandwiches are made in house using the freshest and best ingredients around.”
It is rumoured that the team are waiting for an alcohol license application to go through before releasing further details.

This year, Jameson’s Barrelmen’s Homecoming will invite bartenders to connect, share knowledge and create new cocktails ‘From Farm to Glass’ for the chance to receive up to €20,000 towards a local community project.
Produced by Irish distillers in Midleton Distillery, Jameson Irish Whiskey has launched its annual global bartender engagement platform called Jameson Barrelmen’s Homecoming.
From Farm to Glass, the programme’s theme for 2019, will challenge bartenders to work with the local community to take advantage of what the area has to offer in order to create a new Jameson-based cocktail that complements the smooth taste of the whiskey.
The competition will encourage participants to meet and share knowledge with one another, in keeping with Jameson’s ethos of promoting connections between people, and as a consequence to broaden and develop skills.
The global programme will launch in around 30 countries including the US, Malaysia, Brazil and Sweden, with the one-day events bringing together local bartenders to discuss ‘From Farm to Glass’ as well as offering masterclasses on Irish whiskey and the wellbeing of the bartender.
The event will also give bartenders the opportunity to qualify for a place at the global event, taking place in June, through a cocktail competition.  Bartenders will be required to create a simple cocktail utilising the flavour profile of Jameson Irish Whiskey, Jameson Black Barrel or Jameson Caskmates, epitomising the brief of From Farm to Glass.
International cocktails experts Oisin Davis and Andre Duncan will lead a seminar entitled Grow Your Own Cocktail, forming the basis for an online documentary series showing bartenders how to source, forage and grow local ingredients and how to use them in the most effective way.
The winners of the local heats will be invited to attend the global Jameson Barrelmen’s Homecoming event in Ireland, taking place in June 2019, with the opportunity to win a partnership with Jameson Irish Whiskey in order to develop a project supporting their local community and with funding of up to €20,000.

In addition to a programme of educational seminars and entertainment, the global cocktail competition will test bartenders on classic Irish cocktails and the creation of new ’From Farm to Glass’ serves.
International marketing director for Jameson at Irish Distillers, Simon Fay, said: “Jameson Irish Whiskey is leading the renaissance within the category that we have seen over the past ten years.
“Bartenders around the world have been key to the global success of Jameson, so we are incredibly proud to unveil the evolved Jameson Barrelmen’s Homecoming programme as it underlines our commitment to supporting bartender education, community and innovation.

With the 2017 wines, Symington Family Estates has announced the first back-to-back vintage declaration in its history but also one of the smallest.
The “remarkable” 2017 crop was eventually judged good enough to be declared a vintage and so follows on from the highly acclaimed 2016s (declared last year) to be the first consecutive vintage pair since the company was founded in 1882 and just the sixth declared vintage of the 21st century – and also the smallest, producing a third less than the 2016s (which was also a small vintage).
This was due to low rainfall and high summer heat which resulted in small but compact bunches, with the final crop 20% below the 10-year average.
It was also an exceptionally early harvest with harvests beginning in August but the wines had, “extraordinary intensity, concentration and structure, combined with stunning aromas and freshness,” Symington Family Wines said in a statement.
The conditions of the year were very close to 1945 which produced an extremely famous vintage it was also noted.
Charles Symington, head winemaker at Symington Family Estates, said: “In my 25 years as a winemaker in our family vineyards, I have never seen a year like 2017. The yields were extremely low, but the concentration and structure took my breath away. We have made some really remarkable wines.”
Vintage Ports have been produced across Graham’s, Dow’s, Warre’s and Cockburn’s as well as Quinta do Vesuvio, Capela da Quinta do Vesuvio and Graham’s ‘The Stone Terraces’, with the 2017 marking just the fourth release of the latter two.
Johnny Symington, chairman at Symington Family Estates, added: “Few wine regions in the world restrict vintage years with such integrity as we do in the Douro. The decision to declare Vintage Ports from two consecutive years was not one taken lightly. However, these two exceptionally strong harvests have produced wines of such immense quality that we felt justified in making this historic decision.”

Mahou San Miguel, which owns lager brands Mahou and San Miguel, made just over €260 billion in net profits in 2018.
The brewer also “significantly increased” its investment within the business by 31.5%, to €119.8 million, which has been allocated to update and rennovate its production centres in Spain and overseas.
San Miguel’s total sales also set new records, reaching 18.3 million hectolitres, an increase of 10.2%, of which 14.1 million came from beer and 4.2 million from flavoured and functional mineral water.
Alberto Rodriguez-Toquero, Mahou San Miguel’s CEO, said the company’s growth last year “demonstrated our capacity to anticipate market needs, leading and driving the category through innovation, premiumisation and generation of new experiences.”
Last year, the drinks giant invested €25.4 million in product innovation, up 23% from 2017, and launched three new products to the market; Mahou Maestra Dunkel, San Miguel Radler, and Mahou Cinco Estrellas Radler. Just under 5% of its total net sales came from innovation, compared to 3.8% in 2017.
The company has also invested in craft beer brands. At the end of 2017, Mahou San Miguel bought a 30% stake in Colorado-based craft brewer Avery Brewing as part of its ongoing strategy to position itself as the leading Spanish producer in the craft beer sector, and strengthen its presence in the US.

The United States Trade Representative (USTR) has proposed tariffs on US$11 billion worth of imports from the EU in response to its subsidies that support Airbus over rival aviation company Boeing.

The USTR has released a list of products – including wine, cheese, aircraft, motorbikes and olive oil – which will be affected by the proposed tariffs. It cites evidence put forward by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which found that EU subsidies to Airbus have caused “adverse effects to the United States”. The USTR estimates that these adverse effects amount to as much as $11 billion in trade each year. Ruling back in May last year, the WTO stated that Airbus had received illegal funding for its A380 and A350 models, adversely affecting Boeing’s sales.
US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, said: “This case has been in litigation for 14 years, and the time has come for action. The Administration is preparing to respond immediately when the WTO issues its finding on the value of U.S. countermeasures.
“Our ultimate goal is to reach an agreement with the EU to end all WTO-inconsistent subsidies to large civil aircraft. When the EU ends these harmful subsidies, the additional U.S. duties imposed in response can be lifted.”
Currently, the product list is preliminary and the USTR has stated that it will release a final product list once the WTO has released a report on the value of the US countermeasures.
In a statement, Boeing said it “supports the U.S. trade representative and his team in their ongoing efforts to level the playing field in the global aircraft marketplace.”
The US first brought its case against EU subsidies to the WTO in 2004. The WTO subsequently looked into the matter, finding that between 1968 and 2006, Airbus had received $18 billion in subsidised financing from the EU.
The EU and the US are already engaged in a trade battle which has seen extra tariffs placed on goods imported to both regions.
In June 2018, the EU Commission confirmed that it would be imposing a tariff on imports of Bourbon and American whiskey from July, in retaliation to president Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 25% tax on imports on steel.
In July, Canada responded to the US president Donald Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs with its own countermeasures, imposing tariffs on more than 250 US-made goods – including a 10% tariff on American whiskey – as well as a 25% duty on US metal products.
Mexico also imposed a retaliatory tariff of 25% on US whiskeys, and China introduced a 25% hike on American whiskey imports.
With respect to American whiskey, in a report released at its Annual Economic Briefing in March 2019, the US Distilled Spirits Council reported the imposition of retaliatory tariffs beginning in June 2018 had caused exports to decline by 8.2% between July and November compared to the same period in 2017. But the available data was only through to November, and the council declined to project full year results.

the drinks business is delighted to announce that leading UK tax warehousing company and wine storage specialists London City Bond (LCB) is sponsoring the Independent Retailer Award at the 2019 Drinks Business Awards, due to be presented on 21 May at the London Wine Fair.
The Independent Retailer Award is presented by the drinks business to the company that combines impeccable personal service with in-store innovation and independent flair. LCB stated that the winner will share its “passion for, and dedication to, providing clients with the very best possible service and a willingness to always go that extra mile”.
Previous winners include London retail chain Borough Wines & Beers and wine specialists South Downs Cellars. Borough, who picked up the award in 2016 and 2018, impressed the judges with its investment in its online presence, a click & collect service that means orders are ready within 24 hours, and the expansion of its spirit offering.
This year, LCB is celebrating 30 years in business under its current ownership. The company actually dates back to 1870. Taken on by Ben Jones and Alf Allington, it has grown from one small warehouse on the north bank of the Thames to an estate with 12 sites across the whole of the UK, and is planning to open a further site later this year “to cope with the continuing demand from new customers”. In total, the company’s sites cover two million square feet, while it also expands its reach through its in-house fleet of delivery vehicles.
LCB’s flagship warehouses are capable of picking over 50,000 cases of wine for customer orders every night. Running through the night, its fleet of articulated lorries move customer orders between six distribution hubs for delivery later in the day. A total of 280 vehicles can be on the road in one day, serving a minimum of 70% of UK mainland postcodes every day.
LCB’s Vinotheque warehouse at Burton-on-Trent holds around £1 billion worth of the world’s finest wines, maturing in a Mitsubishi-designed climate control system, maintaining constant temperature and humidity levels.
Alf Allington, LCB’s managing director, attributes the company’s success to “the work ethic of the team and the culture of the company”.
He added: “Another important factor is that with no outside shareholders to satisfy, we are driven entirely by operational needs. This entire focus on operations, service and systems development has led directly to this sustained growth catapulting LCB to become the UK’s number one, and all through market reputation and word of mouth.”
Engineered to recognise and reward the top performers across the international drinks industry, The Drinks Business Awards were launched 17 years ago. Divided into personality, business and marketing sections, other awards include Retail Buyer of the Year, Best Drinks Company of the Year and Best Drinks Event.

“Hot on the heels of the 2016s” Port estate Quinta do Noval has declared the 2017 vintage for both the Quinta and its ‘Nacional’ label.
Alongside Symington Family Estates, the property has declared both the 2016 and 2017s as full-blooded vintage Ports, “perhaps among the best we’ll ever see,” according to managing director Christian Seely.
Seely said he considered the wines, “to be among the best I have known during my time at Quinta do Noval. The decision to declare them was a very easy one.
“As is well known, at Quinta do Noval, we do not hesitate to make small declarations of our Vintage Ports even in years which are not being generally declared, provided that the quality is excellent.
“But the 2017 is clearly an exceptional year which I believe will be remembered as one of the historic Vintage Port declarations of Quinta do Noval.
The wines are characterised by an exuberant ripeness, with remarkable aromatic intensity, profound fruit and strong velvety tannins. These are great, very seductive Vintage Ports, hugely enjoyable to taste now, but clearly with immense ageing potential. Perhaps among the best we will ever see.”
As was the case across the region, a hot and dry summer led to an early harvest and extremely concentrated (and small) crop.

Tech company Smart Spirits has launched a drink dispenser that allows you to create unique beverages that supposedly replicate the flavour of spirits such as whiskey, gin or rum at home.

The dispenser, which is being rolled out in the UK, USA and EU throughout 2019, makes over 30 different drinks across all major spirits categories with its unique ‘Taste Of’ capsules.
The capsules come in a range of flavours that mimic the taste of alcoholic drinks, including “Tennessee Bourbon”, “Black Sambuca” and “Irish Whiskey”. These capsules are meant to be inserted into the device, much like a coffee machine, before being mixed with a neutral grain spirit also sold by the tech company, or water, or a mix of the two, allowing consumers to control the ABV of their end product.
It uses Bluetooth connectivity to link up to any iPhone or Android smartphone via a Smart Spirits app.
According to Smart Spirits’ website, almost all spirits have the same basic recipe: “alcohol, water and flavour.”

“There are any number of new brands vying to achieve ‘premium’ status, even when they lack the necessary gravitas and kudos, so the confused consumer often selects the most advertised brands by default.”
A great deal of time, labour and, more importantly, resources go into developing aged spirits such as whisky and rum, leading many spirits companies to launch sustainability initiatives to counteract the affects of their beverage production on the environment.
But the tech company claims its flavour capsules can “replicate the taste from the ageing process with natural and nature identical flavours .”
An increasing number of businesses are launching home drinks dispensers. AB InBev partnered with coffee-maker Keurig in November 2018 on a device capable of preparing cocktails, beers and ciders through ‘pods’ that contain signature blends of spirits and natural flavours, created by in-house mixologists.
Pernod Ricard also sells an OPN at-home cocktail dispenser, which mixes cocktails and is controlled through an app. In contrast, OPN uses 75cl cartridges filled with varying spirits that are connected intelligently to track levels, measure and mix drinks via an app, and was expected to be rolled out commercially last year.
However, Smart Spirits said these devices “focus on pre-formulated cocktails, without the range of choice or the control of the Smart Spirits system.”

A group of fraudsters that were involved in a £1 million wine investment scam have been jailed for a combined total of 17 years and nine months after being sentenced at Southwark Crown Court last week.

Many of the individuals targeted by the group in the scam, which took place between 2013 and 2015, were elderly and vulnerable.
Adam Edwards, Barry Warner, Christopher Brummit, Tarik Drissi and James Brooks were sentenced on 5 April at Southwark Crown court after being found guilty of fraud.
The five men operated three fake companies called Mayfair Worldwide Trading Ltd, Commodex Global Limited and Winchester Associates Ltd. Each company claimed to be fine wine brokers operating out of glitzy London locations such as Berkeley Square in Mayfair. The businesses were instead registered in an industrial state on the outskirts of Great Dunmow in Essex.
The men targeted known fine wine investors, selling their wines onto legitimate buyers and pocketing the proceeds. They then lied to their victims about the whereabouts of their money, with some being told that it had been reinvested into graphene, diamonds or gold.
Victims were exposed to a series of aggressive sales tactics, with Mayfair Worldwide Trading even issuing a bogus press release claiming it had won fake award in order to boost its authenticity.
At the court hearing, Adam Edwards was sentenced to six years in prison plus a five year Director’s Disqualification Order; Barry Warner was sentenced to five and half years in prison; Tarik Drissi was given three years; James Brooks was given a 20-month sentence suspended for 2 years with 300 hours unpaid work; and Christopher Brummitt, who was absent, was sentenced to three years and three months in prison, plus a five year Director’s Disqualification Order.
Sian Mitchell, specialist prosecutor at the CPS Specialist Fraud Division, commented: “This was an unscrupulous gang who would go to great lengths to defraud elderly and vulnerable people out of their very valuable wines, many of which represented their savings for their retirement. One of the victims was a disabled man who, as a result of not receiving payment, was unable to buy a new wheelchair.
“They went to great lengths to legitimise their fraudulent activities – Mayfair Worldwide Trading issued a bogus press release claiming that the company had won the ‘2014 ID Times Trading Award for Best Asset Exchange Programme and the Internship Europe Excellence Award.’ Obviously, no such awards existed, and were designed to dupe innocent investors.
“We are delighted to have secured custodial sentences for this group, and will continue to prosecute those who think they can benefit from fraud.”

Vijay Mallya, the former head of United Spirits, has until the end of this week to file a new appeal against being extradited to India to face charges of fraud and money laundering, after his first was rejected last week.
(Photo: Wiki)
The High Court in London has rejected his first initial appeal following Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s upholding of the order issued by Westminster Magistrates Court in early December. Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot found that Vijay Mallya has a case to over substantial “misrepresentations” of his financial dealings
Mallya, the former head of United Spirits, is wanted to face trial over debts of some £1.15 billion associated with the failure in 2012 of his Kingfisher Airlines venture. In India, the authorities have already seized assets owned or controlled by Mallya worth approximately £1.5 billion.
However, they stress that enforced repayment of Mallya’s debts does not absolve him of the alleged criminal activities.
Mallya maintains that he always intended to repay his debts and that he has made full proposals to do so. He alleges he is being made a scapegoat by the Delhi government.
The news agency PTI has reported a court official as saying: “The application for permission to appeal was refused by Justice William Davis on April 5. The appellant has five business days to apply for oral consideration. If a renewal application is made, it will be listed before a High Court judge.”
If Mallya makes a further appeal it will take the form of a brief oral hearing at which legal teams for both sides will restate their cases.
If that fails, Mallya will have little further room to delay extradition. In India many commentators suggest that he is trying to do so until this month’s general elections are concluded in the hope that a change of government will alter attitudes to him.
In separate proceedings in London Mallya’s global assets have been frozen, with his lawyers suggesting he is willing to cut his spending to £29,000 a month compared with the £18,300 a week previously sanctioned by the court.

Exports of all US wines reached US$1.47 billion in 2018 despite a stronger dollar and various global challenges.," 9th April, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/04/us-exports-top-us1bn-in-2018/,"9th April, 2019

Exports of all US wines reached US$1.47 billion in 2018 despite a stronger dollar and various global challenges.
Total exports in 2018 were down 4.8% in value and 1.2% in volume (to 375 million litres/41.7m cases) and this was due to the dollar exchange rate as well as the retaliatory tariffs China has in place and the implementation of free trade agreements between countries in Asia and various New World rivals such as Chile and Australia.
California continues to dominate US exports – to the tune of 90% – and Robert Koch, CEO of the California Wine Institute, said that the state’s wines had “performed well under very challenging circumstances”.
In part this was due to, “top markets continuing to embrace our reputation for premium quality, leadership in sustainable winegrowing and diverse offerings,” and also various marketing programmes that, “continued to generate new fans among media, trade and consumers”.
Exports from California have risen 60% in the past decade and 170 wineries now export to 142 countries.
The top markets by value are: Europe (US$469m), Canada (US$449m), Hong Kong (US$130m), Japan (US$93m), China (US$59m) and Mexico (US$27m).
Charles Jefferson, Wine Institute vice-president of Federal and International Public Policy, said: “We have made critical progress on trade agreements with the UK, Mexico and Canada, and we continue to advocate for wine tariff elimination in key markets including China and Japan.
“Wine Institute will continue fighting for a level playing field and the removal of trade barriers in markets around the world.”
The UK showed strong volume growth in 2018 – up 15% – although value declined a slight 1.4%.
Damien Jackman, Wine Institute trade director, UK and Ireland, commented: “This is an impressive result considering that the British pound (GBP) closed the year at $1.26 against the US dollar versus its pre-Brexit buying power of $1.55 or higher.
“These currency headwinds impacted the value/volume mix of many importers.  At the same time, volume growth has resulted from growing trade interest and sales of Californian wines under £20.
“This has been a key focus of our California Wine Institute programs in the UK and was the central theme of our recent ‘Essential California Tasting’ in London which was praised by the trade for its focus.”
In Asia meanwhile there was a “softening” after several years of positive growth thanks to the current trade spat between Washington and Beijing.
Christopher Beros, Wine Institute trade director for China and Pacific Rim, explained: “In 2018, US wine exports to Asia experienced a softening compared to the healthy growth rates of the prior two years. A nearly 25% decline in exports to China by value was the largest contributor to the softness, primarily the result of trade issues between the US and China and the increased tariffs on US wines imported into Mainland China.
“The long-term prospects for California wine sales in China, however, remain very strong. Exports to Hong Kong are a bright spot, growing 10% to $130 million in 2018. Clearly some of these wines are being re-exported to other countries including Mainland China. Exports to Vietnam increased by 51% from a small base. Vietnam is a promising market for California wines with its huge population, young average age, and aspirational consumer psychographics.”

ASC Fine Wines has made a push for ‘everyday Bordeaux’ wine in China’s lower tier cities with the ‘Grand Bateau’ label, which will be distributed through Changyu Pioneer Wine Company, the wine merchant has announced.
Grand Bateau is a collaboration between Maison Barrière and Château Beychevelle, both of which are part of the Suntory company’s portfolio in Bordeaux.
Having gained exclusive distribution for the wine in 2017, ASC reported that Grand Bateau’s business recorded a 400% increase in 2018, according to the company.
During the Chengdu Wine Fair last month, ASC signed a strategic bilateral partnership agreement with Changyu, in which Grand Bateau is a key brand that ASC and Changyu will co-operate closely on as they seek greater market penetration, particularly in the second- and third- tier cities.
It was also revealed Maison Barrière will increase its investment in China to support the growth of its business in China.
Described by ASC CEO Yoshi Shibuya as a wine that pursues the “excellence of great Bordeaux”, Grand Bateau red is made from a blend of 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 80% Merlot.
The white wine is 100% Sauvignon Blanc.

While still wine consumption is set to stay fairly flat for the next few years, organic styles are rapidly entering the mainstream.
Senior woman holding a cluster of grapes
IWSR Drinks Market Analysis released a report last year on the state of the global organic wine market.
The report shows that, despite overall wine consumption is predicted to stay fairly flat over the next three years, organic style are bucking the trend in every key market.
Around the world, drinkers are predicted to get through 87.5 million cases of organic wine annually by 2022.
“Overall, total still wine volume is increasing slightly but remains largely flat, while the organic market is forecasted to reach 87.5m cases” said Mark Meek, IWSR’s CEO.
In addition the report, which also includes findings presented at the Millesime Sudvinbio fair earlier this year, found that people are still willing to spend more on sustainable drinks, and the total organic area under vine has increased by 234% since 2007 and in 2017 surpassed 400,000 hectares.
We’ve pulled out five key facts we think are important for industry insiders to know.
 
Europe dominates
The vast majority of organic wine is consumed in Europe.
The European Union defines wine as ‘organic’ if it is produced from organic grapes or from oenological techniques and substances authorised for organic wine. Wineries receive regular inspections from agricultural authorities for roughly three years before they can gain certification.
But in the US, the United States Department of Agriculture rules that both the growing of the grapes and their conversion to wine must be certified before a bottle can be labelled as organic.
Meek said that, currently, organic wine consumption is “being driven by Europe, which will account for 78% of the global organic wine market by 2022.”
 
People are happy to pay more
The report found, perhaps unsurprisingly, that consumers in the UK are paying an average 38% more for a bottle of organic versus non-organic wine, and are buying considerably more red wine than white/rosé (60% versus 40% respectfully).
 
Consumers can vary depending on location
Producers who wish to sell organic wine overseas may need to think carefully about who they target, and where.
The report found that, while people who buy organic tend to have higher incomes, the audience for organic wine is different depending on where they are based.
In the US, for example, buyers tend to “skew female, Millennial, and higher income”, pursue healthy lifestyles and “have a preference for natural food and beverage products.” In the UK the same is true, but there is a greater focus on buyers in “metropolitan” areas.”
However in Germany, while the target consumer still tends to be female and with a relatively high income, they also tended to be over 50.
and in France, where organic styles make up some 4% of the country’s total wine consumption, “Though Paris is the key driver of the country’s organic wine market, the trend is beginning to spread into other large metropoles and the French countryside.”

Sea Change, an environmentally-minded wine range created to support ocean conservation, has been launched in Hong Kong through Beef & Liberty.
Only available in rosé at the moment, the pink wine is listed at the steak and burger specialty by the glass and by bottle, its first entry into the Asian wine hub.
Developed by 10International, the range actively supports ocean conservation with 25 euro cents from the sale of each bottle being donated to Plastic Oceans UK and Sea-Changers. The two charities are geared towards raising awareness of the problem of plastics in the ocean and supporting beach clean-ups and conservation efforts.
The range has been designed with minimal packaging in mind to reduce potential waste and to maximise its environmental credentials. It claims no plastic was used in the finished product, and that ‘Grape Touch’ labels have been used, which consist of 15% recycled grape waste with the remaining raw materials coming from FSC certified forests ensuring environmental and social benefits.
Its closure features no plastic elements and is fully biodegradable and recyclable. It also eliminated the use of capsule to minimise packaging.
It was named ‘Green Launch of the Year’ by the drinks business at the Green Awards last year.
The wine is priced at HK$65 glass and HK$220 a bottle.

Bad weather has pushed down yields in Barossa Valley, with harvests said to be the lowest in 10 years.
According to a report by Australian journal Financial Review, local experts say the harvest for 2019 vintage could be down as much as 50% compared with last year’s 78,000 tonnes in Barossa, due to frost and hail damage.
The region was hit by a dry winter last year, then frosts in September and November, followed by hailstorms in late November before extreme heat enveloped the region in the first two months of this year.
The adverse climate is expected to have affected production at many wineries including the country’s leading wine giant, Treasury Wine Estates and its Penfolds brand.
“It will be the lowest-yielding vintage in the last decade. There’s not much anyone can do about frost and hail,” Barossa Grape & Wine Association viticulture development officer Nicki Robins was quoted as saying.
Commenting on the low yields in Barossa, a spokesperson for TWE commented: “We are still feeling really good about the overall vintage in Australia. While some regions might be below the prior year’s vintage, there are other regions for us that are well above the prior year vintage.”

Distill Ventures, a Diageo-funded small business investment firm, has appointed Ara Carvallo as a portfolio director as it expands its senior team and European presence.

The appointment completes a trio of new senior leaders across the company’s global operations. In 2018 Matt McKee joined as MD of Rest of World, and more recently Nicolas Proszenuck was appointed as Investment Director in North America.
Carvallo said: “I’ve been fascinated by Distill Ventures since the company started six years ago; the unique approach of this exceptionally talented team, which empowers entrepreneurs with the freedom and tools required to scale their brands is something that I’ve always applauded. It’s incredibly exciting to be working alongside some of the most innovative brands and people in the industry.”
Distill Ventures has provided funding worth £60 million to more than 15 independent drinks brands including Danish whisky, Stauning, Melbourne-based whisky producer, Starward, and American single malt whiskey, Westward.
While Distill Ventures is independent, Diageo has been working with the company since 2013 and is its sole investor. The company helps fund innovation within the spirits world, drawing on industry expertise to identify, invest in and accelerate aspiring drinks brands, while affording Diageo an effective route to invest in new spirits brands.
Last year, Diageo acquired German vermouth brand Belsazar – the first company to have “graduated” from Distill Ventures.
The company announced it would set aside around £40,000 for a fund dedicated to non-alcoholic drinks brands in 2017.
Frank Lampen, CEO and co-founder of Distill Ventures, Carvallo “brings deep knowledge of both the European market and Mexico, and through her work at Barra Mexico she has real insight into founder-led spirits brands.
“Having seen Belsazar acquired by Diageo, and with Seedlip growing strongly, we’re focused on helping the next brands in the portfolio to achieve strong sustainable sales growth and Ara’s experience will increase our ability to do this.”

"“We are closer than we have ever been,” said Séverine Schlumberger of Domaines Schlumberger in reference to Alsace imposing legal guides to sweetness levels in wine on labels."," 9th April, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/04/alsace-closer-than-ever-to-imposing-legal-sweetness-guides/,"9th April, 2019

“We are closer than we have ever been,” said Séverine Schlumberger of Domaines Schlumberger in reference to Alsace imposing legal guides to sweetness levels in wine on labels.
Séverine, the seventh generation of her family to manage the Alsace wine estate, said the producer had been using sweetness guidelines on their bottles for 10 years.
“We’re pushing to have them imposed by law,” she said. “The co-ops are against it as they often make sweet Riesling and they don’t like people knowing how sweet it is.”
Bottles of Domaines Schlumberger wines are ranked according to their levels of residual sugar in the following categories: dry, medium dry, medium sweet/mellow and sweet.
As a guide, Séverine said the wines in the dry category contained between 6 and 8g/l of residual sugar, medium dry wines had between 8 and 16g/l, medium sweet or mellow wines had around 16 to 40-45g/l while sweet wines were above 45g/l.
Back in 2015, it was announced that plans for the compulsory labelling of all dry Alsace wines as dry were to be put on hold. The Alsace Vintners Association (AVA) had achieved near-unanimous approval for the proposals and had planned to introduce the labelling from the 2016 vintage onwards.
The AVA submitted a file asking the INAO to impose an obligation on the labelling of Alsace dry white wines – wines with less than 4g/l of sugar, or 7g/l of sugar in wines with a minimum of 9g of tartaric acidity, according to EU rules.
According to measures for vendange tardive (late harvest) and sélection des grains nobles (SGN) wines drawn up in 1983 and implemented in 1984, Riesling and Muscat must have minimum sugar levels of 235g/l for VT and 276g/l for SGN while Gewurtztraminer and Pinot Gris must have 257g/l for VT and 306g/l for SGN.
Séverine was speaking to members of the wine press at a tasting at The Rosebery Lounge at the Mandarin Oriental in London. The Rosebery is currently pairing three of the estate’s Grand Cru wines with afternoon tea – the Riesling Grand Cru Saering 2015 with a selection of sandwiches, the Gewurztraminer Grand Cru Kessler 2015 with scones with jam and rose petal jelly, and the Pinot Gris Grand Cru Kitterle 2011 with a patisserie selection.
“I don’t like drinking Riesling by itself – it works so much better when it’s dry and it’s mean to be drunk with food,” Séverine added.
“Riesling is like an apple, no matter when you eat it it will always be acidic. Pinot Gris is more like a peach, an our Grand Cru Pinot Gris is like a peach that’s been left out until the end of the week – it is fruiter and tastes sweeter. Gewurtztraminer is like exotic fruit – it’s also hard to grow.”
She said that sales of her Riesling were rising year-on-year in the UK, with the country now ranked fifth or sixth in the estate’s top export markets. Domaines Schlumberger exports 65% of its wines, its top two markets being Belgium and the US.
The estate is also looking to boost its direct to consumer and cellar door sales with the opening of a new tasting room and cellar door in May at its site in Guebwiller.
Cellar door sales currently amount to €200,000 a year, equating to 5% of total sales. Séverine told news site DNA that she hopes the investment will triple this figure in the next five years.

While reductive styles of Chardonnay have become popular the world over, the practice should be approached with caution, according to Michael Brajkovich MW.
Hawke’s Bay is a hotbed for quality New Zealand Chardonnay
Speaking at the inaugural Chardonnay and Sparkling Wine Symposium in Gisborne, New Zealand, earlier this year, Kumeu River’s winemaker, Michael Brajkovich MW, told attendees:
“Some producers make the mistake of playing around with oak and reduction too much. Reduction is a bit like cranking up an amp – cranking it up a bit can improve the sound but too much and it becomes distorted.
“It all comes down to personal taste. It’s great that we have a range of Chardonnay styles in New Zealand – the trend for chasing reduction swung in an extreme direction in the past but we’re coming back to the middle ground now.
“We like consistency and regularity in the New World but ultimately quality will come with complexity and diversity from working with a mixture of different clones and aspects.
Michael Brajkovich MW believes reduction should be approached with caution
“There is a huge demand for NZ Chardonnay now and more vines are going in the ground, but I wouldn’t want us to end up growing as much as Australia as we may not be able to sell it – we also have to keep the quality high,” he warned.
Kate Radburn of Radburn Cellars welcomes the diversity of styles of New Zealand Chardonnay on the market. “We’ve seen more reductive styles come to the fore in the last decade, which is an exciting development.
“A wave of reductive Chardonnays came onto the market when the style became successful, but things have settled down a bit now.
“I expect purity of fruit and beautiful complexity from New Zealand Chardonnay, and weight of flavour in the mouth. If you’re going to make reductive styles of Chardonnay you need good fruit and oak to back it up,” she said.
“The beauty of Chardonnay lies in its diversity of styles, and the grapes thrives all over New Zealand. It’s a very exciting opportunity for us as a country to make small volume, quality focused wines,” she added.
But while reductive styles of Chardonnay are largely welcomed by winemakers, Hugh Crichton of Vidal Estate warned during the symposium that it’s easy to overdo it.
“A lot of people are chasing reduction for the wrong reasons. The key with Chardonnay is to start with great quality fruit with good concentration and to keep reduction in check.
“Heavy reduction can get a bit swampy and sit on the fruit. Chardonnay gives New Zealand winemakers the chance to build more complex wines without masking the fruit,” he said.
“Sauvignon Blanc has done amazing things for the New Zealand wine industry but I’d love to see more Chardonnay in the ground as it can command higher price points, so will become an important part of our story and the next stage of development for New Zealand,” he added.
There are currently around 3,300 hectares of Chardonnay planted in New Zealand compared to 50,000 in France and 42,000 in the US.

The London Shell Co. is set to launch The Grand Duchess which will open on a permanently moored boat beside the team’s debut venture on Regent’s Canal in Paddington, offering seafood and sparkling wine.
Founded in 2015 by siblings Harry and Leah Lobek, The London Shell Co. opened restored cruising wide beam barge The Prince Regent in 2016, in collaboration with chef Stuart Kilpatrick.
The new forty-cover boat will offer a menu focused on British cuisine, with over 90% of their seafood sourced directly from Cornwall and a wine list celebrating English sparkling wine.
Moored on the Grand Union Canal at Paddington Central, guests will have the opportunity to dine outside on the bank of the canal, while The Captain’s Table, a private banqueting space in the bow of the boat, will accommodate parties of between six and thirteen.
The team said: “In our opinion, there is no more romantic or exciting setting to eat fish than on a boat.”
A selection of small plates and sharing platters will be available alongside the lunch and dinner menus, with a choice of seafood-based nibbles to accompany the sparkling wines on offer.
The London Seafood Co.
The menu promises to feature dishes such as beer battered lobster with fried curry leaves and ‘chip shop curry sauce’; monkfish with wild garlic Kiev, new season lettuce, croutons and anchovies; and a surf’n’turf 500g dexter rib with grilled Langoustines in garlic butter.
The wine list will offer 50 sparkling wines and is designed to “celebrate small producers and undervalued regions,” with a choice of seasonal cocktails also on offer.
The team said: “We have always dreamt of opening a static restaurant where you can have your hake and eat it.”
The Grand Duchess will open on 10 June, with the restaurant accepting bookings from 14 May.

A health foundation in the Australian state of Victoria has questioned the sponsorship ‘spin’ of top Instagram influencers by the alcohol industry but its own findings seem a little inflated too.," 10th April, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/04/alcohol-industry-accused-of-social-media-spin-in-australia/,"10th April, 2019

A health foundation in the Australian state of Victoria has questioned the sponsorship ‘spin’ of top Instagram influencers by the alcohol industry but its own findings seem a little inflated too.
VicHealth looked at the top 70 Instagram influencers in Australia and found that over a period of 12 months they posted 477 pictures that featured alcohol.
As both VicHealth itself and other publications have stated, the research found, “almost three-quarters of influencers featured alcoholic drinks in their posts, yet only a quarter fully disclosed when they had been paid by alcohol brands.”
Yet a line in the Guardian noted that of those 477 posts, “12% were likely sponsored mentions”.
In other words, 57 posts were “likely” (and it could be greater) sponsored content featuring alcohol.
As the Guardian post went on: “Of those 61% were disclosed and 39% were undisclosed, meaning they did not feature a hashtag such as #sponsored #ad or #collab or use the “paid partnership” option for brands.”
Again, that means of those 57 sponsored posts, 34 disclosed their sponsorship and 22 did not.
In the span of a whole year, 70 of Australia’s top Instagram influencers posted 57 pictures (“likely”) featuring sponsored alcohol content and 22 failed to disclose this fact. That’s not quite two posts a month.
This fact did not deter VicHealth however, which ploughed on regardless: “The research also found the alcohol industry often partnered with non-alcohol brands like active wear and events such as festivals, allowing the industry to use influencers to promote their products without having to disclose their sponsorship.
“Alcoholic products such as branded glasses of wine or bottles of champagne were often featured as props by influencers, further blurring the lines of what are considered sponsored posts.
“With Instagram and its influencers particularly popular with young people, the findings show the alcohol industry is using social media as a key tool to promote their products as cool and glamourous to an impressionable audience.”
Dr Lyn Roberts, VicHealth’s acting CEO, added: “Our research shows the alcohol industry is employing tactics straight out of the playbook of Big Tobacco, using high profile influencers to make their products appear glamorous and sophisticated to young people.
“What’s most concerning is that influencers and brands can get away with not disclosing paid content, making it really hard for young people to discern when they’re being sold an ad.
“We also know that young people who like or follow alcohol brands on social media are twice as likely to drink at risky levels than those who don’t.
“Alcohol brands spend millions each year advertising their products to impressionable young people and it works – for every advertising dollar spent, young people drink 3% more alcohol.”
As a result, VicHealth announced it was launching a new “competition” called ‘Top Spin’ designed to encourage Victorians to “call out the sneaky tactics” the alcohol industry uses to “keep us drinking and spending heavily”.
Each week of the five-week run AU$1,000 will be offered to winning entries.
 
db view: It’s rich bordering on ludicrous that having cherry-picked some already very selective ‘facts’ from a tiny sample size that VicHealth should accuse the alcohol industry of ‘spin’.
Part of the problem is that Australia does not currently have a national alcohol strategy although there are guidelines which they are supposed to follow.
Whether they do or not is beyond the scope of this piece but VicHealth was about using Instagram.
Again much too broad to examine here is the argument within wine and industry circles about the use of Instagram influencers and how useful/real/helpful they are anyway.
That aside, why shouldn’t brands (alcoholic or otherwise) seek to use new outlets for advertising? They always have and they always will and this is not as insidious as one senses VicHealth would dearly love to imply.
The other problem is that while VicHealth across its site likes to suggest that the alcohol industry uses flawed data, it itself is resting much of its own suggestions on studies that are just as flawed.
Dr Roberts suggests that, “for every advertising dollar spent, young people drink 3% more alcohol”. No supporting evidence or link to any is given to support this nor is there any to support the statement that those that follow alcohol brands on social media are “twice as likely” to drink at risky levels.
The problem that ‘studies’ of this type surrounding social media and advertising routinely make is that they seemingly assume that advertising equals causation. That the mere act of seeing some advertising or even any sign of alcohol or drinking in general makes people go out and drink.
There is indeed a correlation between advertising and drinking as there is for buying washing machines or cars but the idea that people are so slack jawed that mere advertising makes them immediately go out and buy a product should be as laughable as those fears in Cold War America that subliminal Soviet messaging in popular television shows were going to brainwash people into being Communists.
Ultimately, despite finding evidence that some Instagram influencers are not honest about shilling for brands (shock horror), the study comes up with the fat, zero lump sum of absolute nothingness to show that any of those Instagram posts, sponsored or not, actually encouraged anyone to drink, let alone to an unsafe level.
But who needs to measure that when you have a competition to plug?

Sotheby’s next sale in London on 17 April will feature the second tranche of limited edition ‘Versailles’ cases from Château Mouton Rothschild.
The first tranche of 25 cases were sold in Hong Kong at the start of April for HK$7.1 million (£691,120) and the next 25 are now to be offered in London and the final set of 25 will be offered in New York on 4 May.
Featuring a bottle each of the 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2013 vintages, the starting bid per case is £9,000 but Sotheby’s noted that in Hong Kong, “each case quickly soared beyond the opening bid to sell for an average price of approximately HK$283,700/£27,640.
All proceeds from the sale of the 75 cases are going towards restoration projects at the Palace of Versailles.
As well as the five bottles, buyers of the cases will also be invited to a dinner at Château Mouton Rothschild on 21 September this year – an event at which the 1945 vintage (among others) will be served.
Serena Sutcliffe MW, honorary chairman of Sotheby’s Wine, said: “The glory of Versailles and the magnificence of Mouton are a symbol of France’s brilliance and talent. The link between art and wine is centuries old, illustrating the strength of creativity and devotion to excellence in both these fields, and it is the moment to celebrate this marriage of the senses.
“Mouton Rothschild has fostered art, both ancient and modern, throughout generations of the owning family, acquiring treasures for their museum at the Château and commissioning the greatest international artists of our time to design labels for each vintage. Mouton at the Palace, philanthropy and pleasure, this is French flair at its best and an extraordinary opportunity to spread Gallic splendour to all corners of the world.”
The sale will also feature more Bordeaux from the cellar of a Swiss collector, principally first growths and top Right Bank counterparts from the 1980s and 1990.
Burgundy will include bottles and magnums of Domaine Armand Rousseau’s wines from 1986-2003, including magnums of the 1990 Chambertin and 1995 Clos de Bèze. The collection as a whole is valued at £470,000.

Vineyards of the Surrey Hills

With similar groups in Kent, Sussex and Hampshire already in existence, five Surrey wine producers banded together last month to launch the Vineyards of the Surrey Hills, covering wineries based in a designated area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).
The new group consists of five Surrey-based wine producers which include Greyfriars Vineyard, based on the Hogs Back just outside Guildford; Chilworth Manor Vineyard, located on the Chilworth Manor estate which is recorded in the Domesday Book; Albury Vineyard, an organic producer located just outside Guilford; boutique winery High Clandon; and English wine stalwart, Denbies, which is based in Dorking.
To celebrate its official launch on 8 and 9 June, the group has planned activities across all five member vineyards, giving guests the chance to sample the different wines and explore a “secret vineyard trail” at Denbies.
Other activities include live music in the vineyards, an art and sculpture exhibition among the vines at High Clandon, and ‘the battle of Waterloo tasting’ where visitors can sample Surrey wines alongside Champagne.
The wine group has also created a map of the region, which also provides details of how to travel to the area from London or the surrounding counties. All producers are within a 20-mile radius of the capital.
Commenting on formation, Nick Wenman, owner of Albury Vineyard and chair of WineGB South East, said: “England is now internationally recognised as a leading producer of top quality wines. We are proud to be putting Surrey on the map as a premium wine region, offering some of the very best wines and visitor experiences that England has to share.”

Gonzalez Byass has bought the Fournier winery in Ribera del Duero, an acquisition the company said will “strengthen its position as a key player on the Spanish wine scene.”
The DO of Ribera del Duero has a reputation for producing premium wines, typically reds made mainly from Tempranillo grape. The DO represents roughly 16% of Spain’s domestic red wine production.
Around 80% of the grapes are still picked by hand in the region, which recorded a total of 8,224 wine growers and 315 wineries in the 2018 harvest.
Gonzalez Byass owns wineries in 10 of Spain’s most significant appellations including Jerez, Rioja, Cádiz, Cava, Penedés, Rueda, Somontano, Castilla, Rías Baixas and Ribera del Duero, as well as operating estates in Chile and Mexico.
The latest purchase includes both Fournier’s winery and vineyards, which are located in La Finca El Pinar. The property, which began operating as a winery in 1979, comprises of 80 hectares, of which 50 are vineyards. The average age of the vines is 30 years, although some strains have been growing for 70 years.
During the last harvest, Ribera del Duero saw volumes rise to its second highest level in 2018, as the region recovered from disastrous weather last year, which slashed yields by more than 60%. Around 125m kilo of grapes were picked between the middle of September and the end of October, according to The Consejo Regulador de la Denominación de Origen Ribera del Duero.
Gonzalez Byass is not the only business purchasing land in the region. Marqués de Caceres Group opened Bodegas Finca la Capilla in the Ribera del Duero last month. The vineyard was described as “extreme” by the group, sitting at an altitude of 800m, with “severely harsh and cold winters and very hot and dry summers”.

UK retail giant Tesco remains confident it can meet its turnaround targets as it posts strong full year results ahead of expectations.
Booker CEO Charles Wilson with Tesco CEO Dave Lewis
The UK’s largest supermarket reported group sales up 11.5% to £56.9 billion, with like for sales in the UK and Republic of Ireland up 2.9%. Within this, Tesco saw a rise of 1.7%, with the newly acquired Booker business up 11.1%.
Group operating profit rose 34% to £2,206 million with the UK and Republic of Ireland seeing £1,537m, (a rise of 45.1%), with Booker contributing £196m Booker versus £185m last year.
So far it has made savings of £1.4 billion to date towards its £1.5 billion target, and announced it would be paying a dividend of 5.77p per ordinary share.
Chief executive Dave Lewis said the company had met the “vast majority” of the company’s turnaround goals over the last four years and had built a “sustainable base of profitability”.
“I’m very confident that we will complete the journey in 2019/20,” he said.
He added that he was “delighted’ with the broad-based improvement across the business and restored competitiveness for its customers.
“The full year margin of 3.45% represents clear progress and the second half level of 3.79%, even before the benefit of Booker, puts us comfortably in the aspirational range we set four years ago,” he said.
“Whilst the market remains uncertain, our performance to date is strong, leaving us well-positioned to invest in our competitiveness as we continue to celebrate 100 years of great value for customers. We remain comfortable with consensus profit expectations for 2019/20. We are continuing to focus on customer satisfaction, cash profitability, free cash flow and earnings growth.
It reported strong growth in all of its store formats, but noted the strength of its One Stop convenience channel, while online sales grew 2.8%, despite the close of Tesco Direct.
The results didn’t mention the axing of its standalone wine website, Tesco Wine by the Case, which was closed in October 2018 due to lack of profitability.
The grocer also recorded 149,000 more customers shopped at Tesco over the year and noted it had been named as the most improved supplier for third year running by the Grocery Code Adjudicator Survey in June 2018.
More information about ‘untapped value opportunities’ for the retailer will be released in June, it noted.
Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said the financial year had been “productive… but not a bed of roses”.
“Looking into FY2020, challenges remain not the least of which is the comparatives in the first half for the UK business, an industrywide situation. That said if the UK Commissions and Mergers Authority does indeed kill off the attempted merger of Sainsbury-Asda then the mood music around Tesco UK from investors may be better than it could have reasonably been expected,” he said.
Fund manager Freddie Lait, CEO of Latitude Investment Management said the most exciting aspect of Tesco’s financial position lay in getting its pension under control, ensuring neutral debt levels are keeping cash flow high.
“Over the next few years it is likely that Tesco will be one of the highest dividend payers in the FTSE and may even instigate a share buy back,” he said.

"Giusti launched an extra brut Prosecco at VinItaly this week, taking advantage of the fact that its source region, Asolo, is the only appellation in Prosecco that permits this drier style of fizz."," 10th April, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/04/giusti-launches-extra-brut-prosecco/,"10th April, 2019

Giusti launched an extra brut Prosecco at VinItaly this week, taking advantage of the fact that its source region, Asolo, is the only appellation in Prosecco that permits this drier style of fizz.
Following a change in the laws by the consorzio for the Asolo Prosecco Superiore DOCG in 2014, the smallest region of Prosecco became the first and only area to allow producers to label their wines as Extra Brut.
The new fizz from Giusti comes with just 3g/l of residual sugar, half the quantity allowed for any wine labelled Extra Brut, which covers a range of 0-6g/l, and five times lower than the average Prosecco, which tends to be bottled with around 15g/l, and labelled as Extra Dry.
When asked by db on Monday at Vinitaly why the drier style of Prosecco had been produced, founder of the business, Jo Guisti said that it was both to make use of the change in labelling laws, but also because he saw a market opportunity.
“We have noticed a tendancy for the Prosecco drinker to go away from sweeter styles, and because we are in the Montello area, we produce a much better Brut and Extra Brut than anywhere else in Prosecco,” he said.
Acknowledging that Prosecco’s other DOCG, Conegliano Valdobbiadene, makes a “great Extra Dry” – 12-17g/l – he said that Asolo produced grapes that more naturally lend themselves to drier styles of the fizz, because the region, which encompasses both the Asolo and Montello hills, yields a richer and more mineral style of wine, according to Giusti.
He also recorded that more of his customers were asking for a drier style of Prosecco, particularly in the UK, where he said there was a rising demand for Brut, Extra Brut and zero dosage sparkling wines.
The laws in Prosecco DOC and DOCG Conegliano Valdobbiadene don’t prevent producers from making a sparkling wine with a lower residual content than Brut (12g/l or lower), but they can’t put it on the label.
This means, for example, a brand such as Ruggeri, who are based in Valdobbiadene, do make an Extra Brut, and label it as such, but the packaging doesn’t feature the word Prosecco or its source DOCG on the label.
Prosecco encompasses three regions, in order of size:
Prosecco DOC
9 provinces in 2 regions of Italy – Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia
Area under vine: 24,450ha
Max yield: 18,000kg/ha
Production (2018): 464m bottles
Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore DOCG
15 communes in the province of Treviso
Area under vine: 7,800ha
Max yield: 13,500kg/ha

English wine estate Gusbourne has announced that next year it will plant an additional 57 acres of vines in West Sussex.
Scheduled for some point in 2020, the new plantings will boost the West Sussex vineyard to 136 acres and Gusbourne’s total plantings across its West Sussex and Kent sites to 288 acres.
Chief winemaker Charlie Holland, said: “Expanding our vineyard holdings in West Sussex gives us the opportunity to increase production, as well as the flexibility to blend from a wider selection of high quality fruit, as we seek to make the finest sparkling wines.”
First planted in 2004, vineyard manager Jon Pollard explained that the fruit from the chalky soils of the West Sussex vineyard, provide elegance and structure, drive and energy, whereas the clay and sand in our unique microclimate in Kent supply the power, intensity and sheer weight of rich, ripe fruit.”
English wine is going through a growth spurt currently with producers large and small investing in new plantings and expanded production facilities.

Sharing a similar flavour profile to English fizz, “purity and acidity” are the hallmarks of New Zealand sparkling wine according to Jane Skilton MW.
Rudi Bauer of Quartz Reef in Central Otago is leading the charge on the New Zealand fizz front
Speaking at the inaugural Chardonnay and Sparkling Wine Symposium in Gisborne, New Zealand, earlier this year, Skilton told attendees: “For me, purity and acidity are the hallmarks of New Zealand sparkling wine.
“The better our winemakers get, the more complexity they will add to them, but it’s still a very new industry here where freshness is the focus. Regional character is beginning to emerge in New Zealand sparkling wine but people still buy by brand like they do with Champagne – producers triumph over site at the moment.
“Production is centred around Marlborough and Central Otago. There are a few producers leading the way like No. 1 Family Estate and Quartz Reef. Australia, the US and the UK are taking the lion’s share of our sparkling exports at the moment, but we also drink a lot of it ourselves in New Zealand. The overall quality here is high – there aren’t many turkeys.”
Andrew Keenleyside of Akarua in Central Otago is looking to double production of the estate’s sparkling wines to capitalise on the category’s growth
While the NZ fizz industry looks set to grow, Michael Brajkovich MW believes the initial investment required to make sparkling wine is putting winemakers off.
“Serious traditional method sparklers are hand harvested and whole bunch pressed. You have to do it to make quality wine. The juice extraction step is critical.
“Being a sparkling producer is not an easy thing to do – it requires capital and you have to buy a lot of equipment and have the means to build up your stock. The expense discourages many New Zealand winemakers from doing it.
“Being able to use other people’s equipment is helping some producers to make their own sparklers, and once you get going the business model is good,” he said.
“We’re building up our library of reserve wines, which are aged in old barrels. Using around 30-40% reserve wine in our sparklers would be ideal,” he added.
Francis Hutt of Carrick Wines believes the future is bright for NZ sparkling wine. “Sparkling wine is a big effort to make it but I think we’ll see more and more Kiwi winemakers giving it a go over the next few years.
“People like Rudi Bauer of Quartz Reef in Central Otago are helping to pave the way and are giving us confidence in the quality of the sparkling wines we are able to produce in New Zealand.
“It’s still a very small industry at the moment though,” he told attendees at the Sparkling Wine Symposium.
Another producer leading the way on the fizz front is Akarua, which dedicates 20% of its output to sparkling wine production. Being able to use the equipment at the No. 1 Family Estate facility in Marlborough helps.
“Tony Jordan has consulted on our sparkling wines from the start, which has helped us build our style and reputation. We get great acidity in our sparklers in Central Otago. Sparkling wine is booming all over the world and we’re looking to double production as we’re keen to invest in the category as we think it’s going to get much bigger,” Akarua’s winemaker Andrew Keenleyside told db.
“We sell our Brut in the UK through Liberty and it’s going really well. The sparklers across the range are getting better with age, even our non-vintage. I’d love to make a blanc de blancs as I’m a fan of Taittinger’s Comtes de Champagne, but we’re a bit hamstrung by Chardonnay grapes at the moment.
“They’re quite hard to get hold of in Central Otago as a lot of producers grubbed it up. We’ve increased our acreage and I think there will be more plantings in the future as everyone is talking about Chardonnay in Central Otago at the moment,” he added.

E&J Gallo is eying up growth in the super-premium segment as it launches an AOP Côtes de Provence rosé into the UK market.
The new Fleur de Mer brand is hoping to tap into growth of the popularity of Provence rosé, which was is driving the growth of the over £10 category in the off-trade, according to Nielsen, growing 41% in value and 45% in volume in the past twelve months (Nielsen MAT 05.01.19, wine overview for total off-trade)
The wine, a blend of Grenache, Cinsault, Syrah, Carignan and other reds from the Golden triangle of Luberon, has been created in partnership with Les Maïtres Vignerons de la Presqu’île de Saint-Tropez in Provence, a grower’s cooperative with more than fifty years winemaking experience, and made by winemaker Florian Lacroux, a director of wine co-opertive Saint-Roch-les-Vignes, in Cuers.
The brand has racked up sales of +57% growth overall, (62% retail and +48% on premise) in the US since it was launched, with sales up 62% across retail and 48% in the on-trade, Gallo said.
Edouard Baijot MW, Head of Fine Wine EMEA at E&J Gallo Winery described Fleur de Mer as a “fashionable” rosé brand that it was delighted to have as part of the UK fine wine portfolio.
“We want to emulate our success Stateside where the rosé category has grown an impressive +104% over the past 5 years . Fleur de Mer is an exciting proposition which we believe will appeal to UK consumers and contribute to the growth of the category.”
It describes the wine as a “classic’ Provence rosé, with bright fruit notes with crisp acidity and a delicate aromas of fresh watermelon and cherry give way to a complex refreshing palate.

Such has been the success of the latest vintage release from Bollinger, the Champagne house could have easily sold three times the quantity allocated to the UK.
During a discussion with the drinks business in Aÿ, the home of Bollinger in Champagne, a spokesman for the brand said that the 2008 release had been so demanded by UK wine merchants, the house could have sold 300% more than had been allocated to the market.
Released on March 11, the Champagne was snapped up by the trade, keen to take advantage of the belief that the 2008 harvest is widely considered as the best vintage of the noughties after 2002, and the fact that the Bollinger prestige cuvée had been given a 98 point score by Richard Juhlin.
Aside from the quality of the grapes from the 2008 vintage used in the latest Bollinger Grand Annee, the fizz differs from other previous releases in that it is the first Grand Annee to come in the unique, patented, Bollinger bottle – which was first unveiled in May 2012 for the brand’s Brut NV.
Speaking at a press launch for the vintage-dated cuvée in Aÿ on 26 March, Bollinger cellar master Gilles Descôtes described the Grand Année as “a genuine hand-made Champagne”, pointing out that the wines used for the fizz had been fermented in barrel, before being aged in bottle under cork, riddled by hand, and then disgorged manually.
As for the vintage, he called it “legendary”.
Continuing, he said, “2008 was a classical year, it was neither an early, nor a late year, so why is 2008 one of the legendary vintages of Bollinger? We don’t know. What we do know is that nothing was exceptional, but when we taste the wine, it is exceptional.”
La Grand Année 2008 was released to the UK trade at £800 per 12-bottle case.
It is a blend of 71% and 29% Chardonnay from 18 crus: mainly Aÿ and Verzenay for the Pinot Noir, Le Mesnil-sur-Oger and Cramant for the Chardonnay.
It comes with a dosage of 8g/l.

An advert that appeared on television and social media promoting Edrington-owned whisky brand The Macallan has been banned by the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for linking alcohol with risky and irresponsible behaviour.
The advert, which appeared on television, on video on demand (VOD) service ITV Hub and as a paid-for ad on Instagram, has now been banned from appearing in its current form in the UK.
It depicted a man jumping off a clip and falling towards the ground, only to sprout wings and start to fly. It was accompanied by the tagline ‘would you risk falling…for the chance to fly?’ It ended with text stating ‘The Macallan. Make the call.”
The ASA said it had received six complaints against the campaign which stated that the adverts were “irresponsible and linked alcohol with daring, toughness or irresponsible behaviour”.
Edrington argued that the line ‘make the call’ was used around the world as part of the whisky’s branding and was based on the decisions made in the history of The Macallan. The distiller also said that the ad featured a “fantastical story” which was mystical and “clearly removed from the real world”.
Furthermore, it asserted that the advert did not show anything that could happen in real life, and did not depict anyone consuming alcohol.
Clearcast, a non-governmental organisation which pre-approves most British television advertising, said that the ‘daring and toughness code rule’ had been considered as part of the approval process. It had ruled that the ad was “fantastical enough to be acceptable”.
ITV which had shown the ad on its channels and VOD service said “the ad was imaginary, fanciful and dreamlike” and was “detached from reality”. Instagram added that the advert had not violated any of its policies and had not received any complaints about it.
The ASA, however, said the opening scene of the man running and jumping off a cliff was reminiscent of the extreme sport of base-jumping.
It found that in places, the advert was not fantastical enough with there being “no suggestion that the male character had any super-human attributes or powers” and that the scenery depicted “was a typical mountainous landscape”.
It added that the close-up of the man clenching his fists “gave the impression that he was nervous about jumping” and was mustering the courage to launch himself over the edge.
The statement continued: “We considered that the act of jumping off the cliff was very dangerous, potentially fatal, and consisted of extreme risk-taking behaviour. That impression was compounded by the text “Would you risk falling … for the chance to fly?”
“Whilst we acknowledged that some elements of the ad were fantastical, such as the distance the man fell through the clouds, and the sprouting of wings which enabled him to fly away instead of hitting the ground, we considered, nevertheless, that the central message of the ad, which was explicitly highlighted through the tagline “Would you risk falling … for the chance to fly?”, was one of promoting risky or daring behaviour to reap possible rewards.
“Although the character was not seen consuming alcohol at any point, we considered the ads made a clear association between an alcoholic product and potentially very dangerous, daring behaviour and concluded that they were irresponsible.
The advert, which was unveiled in December 2018, was ruled to have breached BCAP code roles for social responsibly and alcohol.
Edrington is now banned from running the advert again in the UK in its current form.
A spokesperson for The Macallan brand said that the company had co-operated fully with the ASA investigation following “a small number of complaints about our brand’s global awareness campaign”.
“In light of the ASA ruling, we have acted to address their concerns and removed the campaign film from relevant channels accessible by the UK audience.
“As phase one of the campaign is now complete, we will take onboard the ruling as we plan for next phase of the campaign.
“The overall theme of the global campaign is about bold decision-making and targeting a new generation of luxury consumers.
“This will continue to be the focus of the global campaign, though we will of course take on board the ASA’s comments in relation to the film elements in the UK market as we develop the campaign in the future.”
The advert was part of the brand’s first global campaign which set out to “avoid category clichés”. Developed by creative agency J Walter Thompson London, it aimed to showcase “bold decision making” focusing on the Scotch’s top markets which include the US, Mexico, Taiwan, China and the UK.
The release of the campaign in 2018 topped off a major year for the brand which saw it open its new £140 million distillery in June.

Santa Rita Estate’s premium Argentinean winery Doña Paula has gained Argentina’s highest accreditation for sustainability.
Doña Paula’s head winemaker Marcos Fernandez
The Mendoza- based winery, which is part of Chilean wine group Santa Rita Estates, has achieved the Bodegas de Argentina Sustainability Protocol 3.0, the most up-to-date version of the country’s sustainability programme, that was rolled out in June 2018.
It is one of only ten Argentinean wineries to achieve the standard, which was originally developed by an association of 240 Argentine wineries and the Catena Institute of Wine, and addresses the specific environmental, social and economic challenges in Argentina’s viticulture and ensures wineries of all sizes can farm sustainably and preserve the country’s viticultural heritage.
The winery’s sustainability coordinator Ana Paula Minatel described it as a “great achievement” made possible by the work the company had carried out in different parts of the company over the past three years,.
“This certification also represents a challenge that drives all the Doña Paula team to improve our social and environmental performance throughout the winemaking process, minimizing the impact of our operations on the environment and generating shared value with our workers, their families and the communities,” she said.
The Doña Paula winery was established by Santa Rita Estates, also known as the Claro Wine Group, in 1997 and now comprises around 760 hectares in the premium areas of Luján de Cuyo and Uco Valleys in Mendoza, including 135hectares at Gualtallary.

We at team db want to celebrate the very best bottles from our Global Wine Masters. Every Wednesday, we’ll select a wine that picked up either a Gold or Master from our competition series, and tell you why the judges loved it.
If you’re ever looking to convince a sceptic that English sparkling wine is a serious quality fizz, then the wines from Wiston Estate are a great, safe pick. If we look across our Global Wine Masters competitions, this producer – based in Sussex – has consistently picked up top scores when judged blind by Masters of Wine against the world’s great sparkling wine regions, above all, of course, Champagne.
In our latest sparkling wine competition, it was the 2009 vintage expression that picked up a Gold medal from our exacting judges, a beautiful mature expression of bottle-fermented wine using grapes from the chalk slopes of the South Downs, carefully crafted by highly-respected English fizz winemaker, Dermot Sugrue.
The sparkling is showing wonderfully now, with flavours of toast, grilled nuts, cream and citrus, finishing with all the refreshment of a freshly-sliced apple – a hallmark of English fizz.
If this appeals – along with the bold and beautiful packaging – then you can buy the wine direct from Wiston for £35.50, and serve it ‘blind’ to those who still think that England can’t produce a great sparking wine

Accolade Wines UK saw profits more than double in the year to 30 June 2018, which it attributed to a better product mix and the recovery of Sterling.
Profits at the UK arm of the Australian wine giant rose 175% to 11,5 million, from £4,1 million in the financial year, according to accounts filed at Companies House last month, with operating profit quadrupling to £16,2 million from 4.8 million in 2017.
Turnover at the company, which was acquired by US private equity firm the Carlyle Group, for AU$1 billion (£548 million) last April, rose 0.72% to £477million. Accolade is owned by the Amphora Group Ltd, which was created by Carlyle for the Accolade businesses.
The directors attributed the increased to a better mix of products, as well as the recovery of Sterling.
“The recovery of GBP has reduced the cost of imported products, offset in part by the decrease of profit margins following the negative initial consequence of the Brexit vote.”
However it noted that gains in Sterling against other currencies had resulted in forex losses on the revaluation of foreign denominated bank and loan balances.
The company also noted impairments following write-down of £6.4 million in total – £1.9 million in intangible assets relating to non-core brands, which was identified in a strategic review, and £4.5m in investment. Going forward, the strategy is to concentre on the key high profile brands, it said.
The company also boosted its stock levels in anticipation of higher sales.
Bank loans of around £10million were repaid last year, as it said the company now had access to funding through Amphora and its related companies, who it said could draw on a 3301m loan facility. Loans were recoded at more than £28million
Accolade’s brands include Hardys, Kumala, Banrock Station, Mud House, Geyser Peak, and Echo Falls

Db talks to Daniel Gibney and Mitchel Fowler of Ferovinum, an exciting new platform helping wine producers, wholesalers and retailers release capital and unlock huge growth
Daniel Gibney and Mitch Fowler of Ferovinum
Can you explain what Ferovinum is and how it works? 
We created Ferovinum to resolve one of the biggest growth barriers facing the wine industry – that enormous amounts of capital are tied up in large inventories for long periods of time, instead of being used to support growth and innovation. Traditional banks or invoice financing platforms don’t sufficiently address this problem, but Ferovinum offers an innovative solution – we buy your wine stock from you and sell it back to you as and when you need it, freeing up cash for more productive use, but the stock is still available when required for onward sale.
What do you offer your customers that finance companies such as banks can’t? 
Speed, flexibility and our understanding of wine and spirits as an asset class. We offer a fully tailored service for each client. We understand that some customers may be in the pre-profit growth stage, which limits access to other forms of capital, whereas we make our decisions based on the quality of the wine. We can look at smaller transactions than banks would consider, and can even buy unfinished stock from wine producers, and allow them to finish it on site – something that’s particularly exciting for the growing number of UK wine producers. We offer short- or long-term plans and customers can re-purchase the wine as soon as they like. As wine is relatively easy to buy and sell in bond, we can offer this service without disrupting our customers’ supply chains. Our method of optimising inventories compares favourably with bank finance, which is far less flexible, and can sit around costing money when it’s not required.
Why don’t we hear much about working capital solutions in the drinks industry? 
Probably because they haven’t really existed in the UK wine industry until now. It’s no secret that the demand for finance and the burden of carrying inventory is proving a barrier to growth, especially for the flourishing UK sparkling wine industry. Providing a neutral platform to hold wine stock is a natural, effective and overdue solution that works for small and large companies.
Are we seeing a change to the way traditional financing in the wine industry works? 
New ideas and technology such as crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending are opening up funding options and fuelling innovation in the wider economy, yet the wine industry seems to be missing out. Traditional finance has not adapted to the specific challenges and opportunities of the wine industry. For example, distributors typically have to buy six months’ or a year’s worth of stock in a single producer allocation and sell it over the course of a year, often offering credit terms to their customers on top of that. That ties up cash for a long time compared with many other industries. Similarly, wine producers hold their wine for years before sale as it goes through the finishing and ageing process. And the more companies grow, the bigger the capital challenges become.
While companies might be able to access some bank or invoice finance, very little credit is given for these companies’ greatest asset – the wine itself. Being able to accelerate cash flows from wine stock offers a substantial competitive advantage whether you’re a start-up or an established firm, and that’s what’s at the heart of our proposition.
Has demand for your service increased on the back of Brexit preparations? 
Yes – our customers’ businesses depend upon being able to service their own customers’ needs come what may, and in the face of Brexit uncertainty, the most prudent course of action is to build up stock to ensure continuity. This is very well suited for our service as we can work with our customers to support such purchases in a short time frame.
Do you only offer this service for wine?
We are adapting our service to look at certain spirits. It is suited to a number of spirits, particularly for ones that have a longer ageing or maturation process.

Champagne Drappier has always been a bit different from the competition, but it’s unique approach is paying dividends, even in declining markets for the French fizz.
Drappier’s Brut Nature is doing well in restaurants in the US
Drappier, a family-run, Aube-based grower and négociant Champagne producer, has a very particular character that makes it something of an outlier among its rivals, but also a highly successful business.
Neither a grande marque nor strictly a grower, Drappier has 60 hectares of vineyards in southern area of Champagne around its winery in the village of Urville, but also buys in two thirds of its supply from vineyard owners in the appellation to craft around 1.8 million bottles annually.
And, according to Charlene Drappier, the 29 year-old daughter of Michel Drappier (who heads up the house), last year was “very good” in terms of sales, with demand up both in the domestic market and exports.
In particular, the two most notable declining Champagne-consuming nations of the UK and France are growth markets for Drappier, with the former even seeing a sales fillip of 10% for the producer in 2018 alone.
Explaining the reasons for the growth of Drappier, even in areas of falling Champagne demand, Charlene told db at the start of this year that the brand may be benefitting from a rising call for “more crafted products”.
“We are independent and family-owned and not of lot of négoce can say that,” she said.
Continuing, she remarked, “People are interest in our story, and they like what do.”
While the UK and French markets are in growth for Drappier, the greatest rate of increase is in fact coming from the US, where Drappier Champagnes saw a leap of 25% in volume sales in the past year.
Helping raise the profile and business of Drappier in North America specifically, says Charlene, is the producer’s Brut Nature, which sommeliers are increasingly taking on by the glass.
“Because it is made with 100% Pinot Noir, which is picked fully ripe, no-one is saying it is too dry, and, if it is blind-tasted, then they think it’s a Brut,” she recalled, explaining its appeal among those who may want low-sugar cuvées, but find them too tart.
Another area benefitting the positioning of Drappier is its focus on sustainability, as Champagne’s first carbon-neutral producer, with an increasing number of its vineyards certified organic (15ha today).
It also eschews all herbicides on its property and now has its own horse, which can plough as much as 6ha of the estate, while it is moving to electric tractors for the rest.
As for its winery, that uses 100% renewable energy, sourced from the sun.
Other elements make Drappier unusual, and in fact, ahead of its time, with a longstanding focus on low sulphur use, including a no-added sulphur cuvée, and an embrace of historic Champagne grapes, such as Arbanne and Petit Meslier, and in the future, Fromenteau too – the local name for Pinot Gris, which Drappier plans to use to make the only varietal Champagne from this grape.
In particular, Charlene is keen that Champagne becomes more eco-minded in its approach to vineyard management.
Commenting on the region generally, she told db, “Champagne means countryside, and we have to remember that the countryside is an ecosystem with more than one crop.”
Concluding, she said, “It is important to re-introduce an ecosystem in Champagne for more balance and biodiversity, but it is hard, because livelihoods may be at stake.”

Diageo has won a summary High Court order against Vijay Mallya, the fugitive former head of India’s United Spirits, to pay $135 million to the global drinks giant after it had to meet a guarantee on a loan to Mallya and his companies.

Diageo Plc, Diageo Holdings Netherlands BV and Diageo Finance Plc, claimed that Mallya, his son Siddharth, their company Watson Limited and a company held in a family trust called the Continental Administration Services Limited, owed them $175million after defaulting on a loan from Standard Chartered Bank, “We are suing Dr Mallya for repayment and damages amounting to approximately $175 million.
This is money Dr Mallya and some of his affiliate companies owe Diageo and we have always been clear that we are entitled to exercise our right to recover the sum in full,” said Diageo.
Last Friday, the UK court ordered Mallya to repay $135 million dollars within 28 days as part of its summary judgement. He has also been instructed to pay £200,000 towards the costs of litigation so far. A further court hearing later this year will determine whether Mallya will be required to repay the outstanding $40 million.
Mallya was refused a right to appeal against the summary judgement.
“We are pleased to have won in a clear vindication of our position”, Diageo said in a statement.
“The court was clear in rejecting Dr Mallya’s claim that there was a deal other than the one we signed. Diageo has consistently rejected those assertions. At all times through the protracted acquisition of USL, Diageo acted appropriately and in accordance with all legal obligations. All arrangements with Dr Mallya have been fully disclosed and accounted for.”
Mallya faces having to pay the $135 million at almost the same time as his final appeal against extradition to India to face charges of fraud and money laundering will be heard in early July.
Whether he will be able to do so is a moot point. India has enforced a global freeze on his assets which has been upheld in London and he is having to maintain his former playboy lifestyle on an allowance of £18,000 a week.
Earlier this month, Mallya was granted a one-year reprieve to repay Swiss bank UBS £20m against a loan secured on his luxury mansion in London. He is also facing the consortium of Indian banks who have initiated bankruptcy proceedings against him in a bid to recoup more than £1.1 billion in loans made to Mallya’s collapsed airline, Kingfisher Airways.
A further blow is that the re-election f Narendra Modi’s government in India dashes Mallya’s hopes of lenient treatment should he be extradited and found guilty. Modi has taken a strong stance against several financial fugitives, including Mallya, who has always claimed that the charges against him in India are part of a political witch-hunt.

After two small harvests, grape prices in Provence have more than doubled over the past two years and one producer has hinted at a possible Provence rosé shortage this summer.
After two short harvests one Provence producer has hinted at the possibility of a rosé shortage this summer
Speaking to db during Vinexpo Bordeaux earlier this month, Philippe Marion, sales and marketing director of Barton & Guestier, said:
“The hardest aspect of making rosé in Provence at the moment is getting hold of the right grapes – availability is a big issue this year.
“There is high demand for grapes and over the last two years we’ve had a couple of low crops in Provence, so grape supply is an issue and grape prices have increased off the back of it.
“Grape prices in Provence have more than doubled over the space of two years – Grenache, Syrah and Cinsualt from Provence all sell for around the same price. Everyone is putting their wine prices up in Provence after two short harvests.
The pale pink Provence rosé style is being emulated the world over
“Those price increases are being passed on to the consumer and rosés that used to be priced at around US$12.99 are now selling on the shelves for $18, but we’re finding that some people don’t trust the quality of rosés under $US20.”
Barton & Guestier’s winemaker, Laurent Prada, told db that he welcomed the grape shortage, as it meant there was no danger of being left with too much stock from the previous vintage to sell.
“We actually welcome the current grape shortage in Provence as it means that we’re releasing our Provence rosé stock slowly and carefully.
“It’s important to manage your rosé inventories as it’s a young wine that needs to be sold quickly – you don’t want to flood the market and leave people with stock that they can’t sell – that would be game over,” he said.
“The fragility of rosé could limit its long-term success. It’s a wine that needs to be drunk within a year, so we don’t want to make more than we can sell. In America they want the wine from that year on the shelves in time for Christmas,” he added.
Provence is now facing increasing competition on the rosé front from other French regions such as the Languedoc and Rousssillon, along with the likes of Italy and Spain, all of which are keen to emulate its delicate pale pink style.
“Rosé currently accounts for 10% of our total production, but that figure is growing. It could get to 20% but it’s dangerous to put too much of a focus on one thing,” Prada warned.
“Rosé is enjoying incredible growth in France – in three to four years it will be a bigger category in terms of volume sales in France than white wine,” he added. An in-depth focus on the global success of rosé will appear in the June issue of the drinks business, published in early June.

One of the complaints we hear from a lot of fine wine investors arriving at Amphora’s door for the first time is that they are always told what to buy but never told when to sell. We are sympathetic both to the investor’s position and, you may be surprised to learn, to that of whoever the investor bought from. With qualifications.
Any self-respecting investment advisor has key obligations, and one of them most definitely is to make the recommendation to sell, when appropriate. One of Amphora’s loudest proclamations concerns the secondary market: if you can’t sell it (whatever it is), it doesn’t qualify as an investment. By definition therefore we understand this requirement.
The problem is that while there are less scrupulous operators in this market place whose only interest is in selling to ‘investors’ more and more wine, we all understand that fine wine investment is a medium to long term activity, so it rather places the onus on the investors themselves to establish not only that their counter-party will be around for the long term, but will also tell them when to sell.
There are plenty of market participants through whom you can buy, merchants for example, who make no pretension of having any interest at all in what happens to you or the wine subsequent to the first transaction. You can’t go back to such people as this and moan about their not having told you to sell, and we do have sympathy with merchants like this because advice to sell is not part of their offer.
So the question is, how do we know when it is time to sell. The answer to this comes in many forms, as we shall now try to illustrate, and sometimes it is not so simple to get absolutely right. It is easier in mainstream investment where there is greater volatility and liquidity to the extent that you can impose disciplines like stop loss levels, which can alternately guide you to sell once a certain percentage gain has been achieved. Thus it becomes mechanical.
Other investors eschew this approach because it is a bit like a tall poppy syndrome where nothing is ever allowed to reach its full potential, but how do you know when a poppy gets too tall for its own good? In our view there are two answers to this, an emotional one and an analytical one.
Back in 2011 if you had owned a Bordeaux wine for two or three years your returns were such that the temptation to sell ought to have been extreme. If an investment doubles then trebles you have to ask yourself what you were expecting the investment to achieve, then tell yourself not to worry what you are leaving behind on sale. What you cannot do is to shut your eyes and hope that prices will keep on going up forever.
To this extent fine wine investment is very different from investing in a business. If you are lucky enough to invest in a business at its inception and it takes off the sky can indeed be the limit in terms of your return if the company continues to grow from a small base, and rewards investors by becoming cash generative and pays that cash back to investors as it grows.
But wine is a drink. It throws off no cash and pays out no dividends. Its price movement is conditioned by one thing only: the numerical relationship between buyers and sellers. That relationship is in turn influenced by a variety of factors which it is Amphora’s business to understand and try to explain to investors, but ultimately there will come a point when buyers no longer outnumber sellers.
Obviously we use our proprietary algorithm to help inform decisions as to the timing of purchases and sales, but these take little account of an individual investor’s risk appetite, which can sit anywhere on the spectrum, and the point at which different investors enter the market. It is perfectly possible to have a willing buyer and willing seller of the same wine at the same time with neither being right or wrong, simply because of the difference in their relative circumstances, and timing.
In truth it is customarily quite difficult to find wines which are egregiously expensive enough to merit a big ‘sell’ signal, and in practice we will most often recommend a sell once a wine has satisfied the pre-agreed ambitions of the investor. What all investors really ought to remember is that they have (or should have) a direct line to their adviser which they should use to assure themselves that their ambitions are still being taken care of, and that their instructions adhered to.
It being Chelsea Flower Show we should be ending this week’s note with ‘a few jobs for you to be getting on with this weekend’, but instead we will leave you with a few wines for you to consider selling.
We have been great supporters of Dominus and very much remain on that tack. That said, Amphora clients have made very good money out of the 2010 vintage which has now become quite stretched, especially against the 2015. Parker awarded both 100 points but the 2015 vintage scores slightly better overall (97 vs 95) and with the 2015 offered at £3,000 and the 2015 at just over £2,500 we believe investors should consider the switch.
Owners of Mouton 2007 and Beychevelle 2007 should also be looking at their options. These wines have done very well over the last few years and are now very expensive on a relative basis. There is much better value elsewhere and we now recommend selling into the current strength.
Pursuant to the Chelsea Flower Show reference it is interesting to note that the judges adopt a similar approach to that used by most wine critics. Essentially they score against a matrix of variables thereby removing the subjectivity, although as with a wine critic the judges are free to opine as to whether a garden is to their own personal taste or not, irrespective of the result.
Anyone wanting a practical demonstration of this might consider coming along to one of the free Amphora “Can You Tell The Difference” blind tastings. Do let us know should this be of interest as they take place on a regular basis. www.apm.wine/rsvp

According to market research company NPD Group, the dine-at-home market is growing rapidly with the demand for ready-to-eat delivered food increasing ten times faster than dine-out.

Through online and app-driven channels, technology has offered the restaurant sector a means of growth that didn’t exist several years ago.
Presenting challenges and frequently requiring capital when businesses face many other cash flow pressures, this growth has, NPD Group suggests, caused disruption.
Continuing to run at around 2%, inflation in the UK is driving food and beverage prices up at a time when consumer confidence levels are still showing a downwards trend.
Real wages have contracted for the past ten years, the longest period of contraction since the 1860s.  While customers believe in choice and convenience, value will always be a key factor in decision-making.
With the implementation of the increase in the national minimum wage, labour costs continue to rise.
Maintaining a large proportion of staff on zero-hour contracts, the hospitality sector is vulnerable to at least one major political party which has pledged to ban this form of contract entirely.
Fuelled by the recent flurry of high street businesses being either wound down or restructured via Administration or Company Voluntary Arrangement, notably including Jamie Oliver’s Italian last week, outrage over business rates is a crucial topic and has been so for years.
In the new economy, commissions payable to online food ordering platforms are typically in the range of 20% to 25% of the total order value.  These commissions, taken with the loss of wet sales associated with delivered food, mean that owners must adapt to this fundamentally altered business model.
Conventionally, the production of a kitchen needed to account solely for the number of in-house covers.  Today, a kitchen must overcome the capacity and staffing challenges created by online orders received at the same time.
The property market, NPD Group notes, is changing as a result.  As landlords and restaurateurs look to maximise kitchen space and reduce under-utilised dining space in their properties, this has resulted in a move away from dine-in customers.
This in turn has meant that properties with a larger kitchen capacity, or with the potential for extension, are now attracting a premium as they offer the ability to meet the increased demand for the takeaway.
‘Dark kitchens,’ servicing only online delivery orders, follows the ‘dark store’ model operated by some supermarkets as they first navigated the demand for online grocery sales.
Currently, as with independent grocers who couldn’t compete with larger supermarkets, smaller operators do not have the scale or the capital to do this themselves.  The difference, NPD Group suggests, is that aggregators are presently applying this model in conjunction with existing branded restaurant chains.
Aggregators could look to take additional margin by creating quality, white-label offerings to match branded restaurant food. Despite making their own products posing a risk, it also presents opportunities for the aggregators to exercise more control over output and reputation, with supermarkets a prime example of how quickly the private label caught up with name brands.
According to market analyst NPD, the food delivery market is expected to grow in value by 17% over the next two years, indicating it could be worth close to 5 billion by 2020.
Despite disposable incomes being low, consumers are increasingly deciding to spend their cash on experiences, including dining at a restaurant or at home via delivery.
The restaurant sector is undergoing a period of sustained metamorphosis with operators needing to balance the day-to-day cash flows in a challenging market against securing the vital capital investment required to shape the business for the future.

Around 516 exhibitors registered for the 39th annual London Wine Fair, an increase of 11% on last year, according to LWF.
However, despite seeing visitor numbers rise up to 14,250 in 2018, this year, 7% fewer guests walked through the doors.
Hannah Tovey, the trade show’s organiser, said the slight decrease in footfall this year came as a result of some guests having to pay for tickets for the first time this year, instead of registering for free as in previous years. “Implementing the charging strategy for some visitors also meant we expected a slight drop this year, something which our exhibitors were on board with. All the exhibitors I have spoken to over the last three days have sighted a better quality of visitor at their stand, with a smaller audience actually being better for doing meaningful business.”
Tovey stressed that the fair attracted a better “quality” of visitors thanks to the new measures.
“2019 was all about attracting a high-quality audience which built on last year’s strategy of delivering on higher numbers of visitors and a refreshed show.”
Miles Beale, chief executive of the WSTA, said: ” “I felt like the numbers were down but that the quality was up. Our members who spoke to us at the show were very happy.”
Tovey added that there was a large rise in visitor numbers between 2017 and 2018, which meant that the fair could “more than withstand a fall in numbers this year.”
She added that the LWF’s team are in “an extremely healthy position in the lead up to next year’s 40th anniversary.”
“2020 will be all about delivering a very special edition of the London Wine Fair; the anniversary will be a fantastic opportunity to celebrate the very best of the U.K. drinks industry and we very much look forward to sharing our plans over the coming months.”
Looking ahead to 2020, Tovey told the drinks business earlier this month that there will be a number of new features at the fair next year, including a space dedicated to low and no-alcohol producers.
The 2020 London Wine Fair will take place at Olympia from 18th to 20th May.

Mike Dawson, winemaker at South Africa’s Journey’s End, speaks about his fondness for the Harwood Arms, reveals why he enjoys visiting urban wineries and explains why nothing compares to London’s wine scene.
What is your favourite restaurant in London and why? 
It has to be the Harwood Arms. I visited this magic pub in 2017 and timed my visit, co-incidentally, with the newly appointed sommelier having to bin end a load of wines that were no longer on their list. As a result, I ended up drinking a 1991 Mosel Riesling which blew my mind. It was certainly the most interesting wine I have ever tasted!
Where / what is your favourite wine offering in London and what would be your go-to first glass of wine when you get there?
I really loved visiting the Urban Wineries dotted around London. It was such an alien concept to me – having spent the last 5 years living in a beautiful farm house in the Stellenbosch mountains, overlooking lush vines where the grapes only have to travel a mere 100 metres to the winery.
I couldn’t believe the quality of the wine coming from a few tanks in a small building in south west London, London Cru winery is definitely worth a visit, and if you can’t make it to the winery then keep a look out for their ‘Gresham Street’ Grenache, a particular favourite.
How does London compare to other big global cities in terms of the wine lists you find there? 
Nothing compares to London. It’s a totally epic city, and in my opinion, the food and wine hub of the world! To have a city that has so many varying suburbs, with some more gentrified than others, all boasting out of this world dining experiences is totally insane.
Soho used to be where all the best restaurants are in my mind, but now the variety is amazing.  It is expensive for me (remember I deal in rands), but I think one would have to be a little naïve to expect a bargain when going out for a meal. You pay for the experience, service and of course great food and drink! Good wine is priceless – London has it all.

Breweries in the US have blamed the Trump administration’s metal tariffs for a loss of thousands of jobs in the beer industry since 2016.

A report published by the Beer Institute and National Beer Wholesalers Association has found that 40,000 jobs have been lost in breweries as tariffs on metal have inflated the cost of aluminium cans.
The study found that 2.19 million people were employed in the US’ beer industry in 2018, down from 2.23 million two years ago.
Suppliers to the brewing industry – enterprises that manufacture bottles and cans, cardboard case boxes, brewing equipment or marketing displays – generate nearly $102.0 billion in economic activity and are responsible for almost 436,650 jobs, according to the Beer Institute.
US president Donald Trump sparked a trade war with several countries after he implemented a 25% and 10% import tariffs on steel and aluminium respectively from 1 June 2018.
“Aluminum tariffs are increasing brewers’ costs and are an anchor on a vibrant industry,” the Beer Institute’s CEO Jim McGreevy said in an emailed statement. “Each brewer is deciding for themselves how to absorb that expense, whether it’s raising prices, laying off workers or delaying innovation and expansion.”

To celebrate English and Welsh Wine Week, industry body WineGB has announced that a total of three million vines are due to be planted this year, resulting in a 24% rise in land under vine in Britain in just one year.
Figures previously announced by Wines of Great Britain (WineGB) had revealed that two million vines were expected to be planted this year, but this has now been increased by a further one million. This, the industry body says, makes the UK one of the fastest growing wine regions in the world.
The three million vines equate to an extra 690 hectares under vine, representing a 24% increase in the total area.
This figure is nearly double that planted in 2018 (1.6 million vines) and triple the number of vines that was planted in 2017.
After a record year in 2018, with favourable conditions experienced throughout the growing season and no severe frosts, a total of 15.6 million bottles were produced. This trumped the previous record (6.3 million bottles in 2014) by 9.3 million bottles.
Much of the planting has taken place in the south east of England in the counties of Kent, Sussex and Hampshire.
At the WineGB AGM, it was revealed there was to be an ambitious single planting project this year in which over 1 million vines were to be planted. In his book The Wines of Great Britain, English viticultural consultant Stephen Skelton MW notes that Mark Dixon of Château Berne in Provence, who made his fortune from serviced office firm Regus, had bought Kingscote and Sedlescombe vineyards and has also taken a lease on a site at Bodiam where he plans to plant vines. Dixon is also rumoured to have bought an estate near Gravesend in Kent.
Commenting on the new figures, Simon Robinson, chairman of WineGB, said: “This impressive figure of 3m vines represents another milestone in the growth of our fantastic industry. Last year we set out our vision that in the next 20 years, at the rate of current growth, we could be producing some 40 million bottles per year. We’re certainly heading towards that. This is a thriving British industry.”
Food minister David Rutley added: “Our winemakers are innovative, creative and determined, so it’s no surprise that we are seeing the fruits of their labour now shining on the world stage.
“I will continue to champion our innovative food and drink businesses, and I look forward to seeing more of our stand-out wines in restaurants and on shelves the world over.”
While expressing pride in the growth of the industry, winemakers have expressed concern with regards to the relative lack of winemaking facilities compared to the quantity of vineyards. Last year’s record harvest volume proved a stretch for many, with a number of vineyards having to order in extra equipment shortly before the grapes were due to be processed.

Crown Imports, a subsidiary of drinks giant Constellation Brands, has been fined US$420,000 by the US Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) for alleged “trade practice violations” in Chicago.
In a newsletter published on 24 May, the TTB announced that it had accepted a “$420,000 offer in compromise from Crown Imports LLC for alleged trade practice violations”.
In a supporting document, it claimed that Crown Imports, which has a portfolio of beer brands including Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Pacifico, Negra Modelo and Victoria, had “engaged in activities and conduct that violated 27 U.S.C 205(b).”
Expanding on this, it claimed that Crown had entered into agreements or understandings with retailers in Illinois indirectly through an independent third party or an affiliate of the retailer. Payment of these parties resulted in the retailer receiving money for “advertising, display and distribution services” relating to Crown’s portfolio of beer brands. In sum, Crown effectively paid to gain shelf space for its products.
According to the TTB, the violations occurred during the period 1 January 2016 and 25 April 2019 at an address in Chicago, Illinois.
This comes after a number of companies including Heineken USA and Eagle Brands were fined following similar trade violations.
Constellation Brands acquired the remaining 50% stake in Crown that it did not already own in 2012. It previously ran the company as a joint venture with Grupo Modelo but acquired the entire business when AB InBev completed its acquisition of Modelo.

Historic east London brewer Truman’s is to relocate from its current location in Hackney Wick to a huge new site the northeast London borough of Walthamstow.
An artist’s impression of what the new Truman’s brewery in Walthamstow will look like
As reported by the Evening Standard, the new 50,000 square feet brewery, set to open in early 2020, will have a production capacity of 25 million litres and will boast a tap room, street food market, live music space and artist studios.
The new Truman’s will offer tours of the brewery and punters keen to make their own beers will have the chance to do so at the site’s brewing school. The news marks a major expansion for the firm, which opened its Hackney Wick brewery in 2013, 24 years after it went out of business.
Truman’s has a long, illustrious history, having first begun brewing in what is now Brick Lane back in 1666, when the company was known as the Black Eagle Brewery. By the end of the 19th century it had become the largest brewer in history, and remained a powerhouse of the British brewing scene for much of the 20th century.
In 1989 the brewery was forced to close its doors on Brick Lane due to financial woes, but the business was revived in 2010 and three years later moved its headquarters to Hackney Wick.
“Having maxed out capacity at our current home in Hackney Wick, our new brewery gives us a springboard to grow for many years to come while flying the flag for east London brewing,” Truman’s CEO, James Morgan, told the Evening Standard.
“We’re delighted to bring Truman’s to Walthamstow and join part of its vibrant and growing craft beer community,” he added. The Hackney Wick brewery will close once Truman’s relocates to Walthamstow.

C&C, the Irish drinks group that rescued Bibendum and Matthew Clark following the collapse of Conviviality last year, has seen pre-tax profits rise 17% to €92.9m following a “transformational year”.
Group net revenue at the Magners and Tennants brand owner grew 188.1%, with operating profits up 21.5%, it reported.
The core C&C business saw organic turnover at the group rose 3.2% to 1,574.9m – with the combined Matthew Clarke (MCW) and Bibendum businesses accounting for around 64% (15.7m) of that total figure over the 11 months.
Although the company said the performance of the combined MCW and Bibendum businesses in the 11 months to 29 February 2019 had been severely impacted by the business disruption linked to the collapse of the Conviviality Group, in April 2018 , trading had stabilised across the division in the second half of the year, generating EBIT (earnings before interest and tax)  of €15.7m for the 11 month period and an EBIT margin of 1.6%.
Group CEO Stephen Glancey said the acquisition had changed the dynamic of the business by giving it unparalleled access to the profitable on-trade channel.
“FY2019 was a transformational year for the company. Despite strong multi beverage brand led positions in Ireland and Scotland, access to the wider UK on-trade had always been a challenge. The acquisition of Matthew Clark and Bibendum changes this dynamic,” he said.
He said the recovery and performance of Matthew Clark and Bibendum since acquisition was “particularly pleasing”, contributing to earnings growth of 20% in FY2019, but the plan was to “steadily restore the equity value” of the acquired businesses rather than to chase short term growth or synergy.
“Value and earnings from a low cost base will take priority and our focus will be on low risk, high value product and customers,” he said, acknowledging that “everyone associated with Matthew Clark and Bibendum from employees through to suppliers and customers” had had a pretty difficult year.
“The key to restoring long term confidence is in the skill set of our managers and their colleagues and this will require shareholder support and patience,” he said.
In March Matthew Clark’s managing director David Philips told the drinks business the company had been quietly working to get back on track and safeguard the business for the future, following the collapse of Conviviality including rebuilding wine stocks back to normal levels, consolidating the range, replaying debt and restructuring of the business.
Bibendum CEO Michael Saunders told the drinks business in December the company had “its mojo” back, and he was confident about the present and future health of the business.

Scotch whisky is bound by strict production rules and centuries of tradition, but hoping to cash in on the trends making millions for other brands, Glaswegian distiller Whyte & Mackay has brought a new take on the amber elixr to market.

Called Whyte & Mackay Light, the new product is a “spirit drink” bottled at 21.5% ABV, which the company said will allow it to benefit from the growing number of consumers who prefer to spend their money on lower strength serves.
“The success we enjoy across the Whyte & Mackay portfolio has been built on the brand that carries our name,” Ruairi Perry, Whyte & Mackay’s head of brand, said.
“We’re continually looking at trends in drinks & listening to our consumers across the UK, which is why we’re delighted to announce the launch of Whyte & Mackay Light.
Perry adds that the Light version of its whisky is “a different product, built with the same younger, lighter consumer in mind.”
“We see a different type of drinking occasion emerging – and Whyte & Mackay Light has been developed to satisfy that occasion.”
The Scotch company, founded i175 years ago, has sold a number of expressions over the years, including an 8-, 12-, 12-year-old Deluxe and 21-year-old Scotch, but the range of its portfolio has doubled since 2016. Whyte & Mayckay relaunched single malt Scotch Tamnavulin in 2016, before bolstering the product mix for its single malt whisky Jura, which launched 5 new whiskies for the domestic market in 2017.
Head of innovation Rod Gillies said the company is aware that it needs to “bring new consumers into the category.”
“With Whyte & Mackay Light, we’re using the strength of one of our existing brands to deliver an attractive option for the growing number of consumers who may be looking to keep an eye on their alcohol intake.”
Whyte & Mackay Light will be sold in Tesco stores nationwide from early June, priced at £12.

London restaurant Sexy Fish and Speciality Drinks have worked together on an own-label bottling of Chichibu whisky from Japan.
The single cask bottling (an ex-Chassagne Montrachet Pinot Noir cask) has produced just 254 bottles which will be available at the restaurant from this week as part of a revamped Japanese whisky menu.
With over 400 Japanese whiskies on offer and following a visit to the distillery last October, the Caprice Holdings’ director of bars, Xavier Landais, wanted an exclusive for the Mayfair restaurant.
Landais said: “Having our own Sexy Fish whisky was the next logical step, and what a whisky! From the legendary distillery Chichibu, we could not have dreamt of a better dram. Pink peppercorn, strawberry, coffee. Super sexy really. Thanks to Ichiro Akuto and Speciality Drinks for making a dream come true.”
Speciality Drinks’ creative director, Raj Chavda, explained that he drew on the restaurant’s aquatic theem for the label design.
The whisky is available at Sexy Fish for £30 per 50ml.

Every year, judges from The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) travel up and down the UK to find local pubs that have transformed into architectural and interior design masterpieces.

The Pub Design Awards, held in association with Historic England, recognise high standards of architecture in the refurbishment and the conservation of existing pubs.
There were five winners across different categories this year, ranging from refurbishment to best ‘street corner local’. Three additional pubs were also highly commended in this year’s awards.
Andrew Davidson, chair of CAMRA’s judging panel, said the boozers that stood out in 2019 were an “eclectic range of buildings, from a 6mx4m micropub on a bustling railway platform to a vast seaside pavilion to a former slaughterhouse.
“What all these buildings demonstrate is that it is possible to fight back against what is sometimes seen as a trajectory of inevitable decline, using imagination and good design. The awards are clear evidence Great British Pub is indeed alive and kicking.”

We at team db want to celebrate the very best bottles from our Global Masters. Every Wednesday, we’ll select a wine that picked up either a Gold or Master from our competition series, and tell you why the judges loved it.

English Wine Week kicks off on Saturday 25 May, and we’re itching to crack out our stash of homegrown fizz. If I had the money to burn, I’d start the weekend with this lovely pink sparkler from Kent’s onomatopoeic winery, Hush Heath.
Grapes for this single vineyard wine were hand-picked in the 2013 harvest, before winemakers Owen Elias and Victoria Ash worked their magic. This year English Wine Week falls on the May bank holiday, so Londoners can sample the estate’s wines themselves by schlepping to the state-of-the-art tasting rooms owner Richard Balfour-Lynn spent £4 million opening last summer.
Fermented in steel vats at 16%, this traditional method fizz spent 31 months ageing on its lees, which clearly made the difference with our judging panel, as it picked up a Gold in our 2017 Global Sparkling Masters.
The judges loved the rosé’s complexity, and despite a very delicate colour which one called “only just a rosé”, more than a few praised its “lovely” fruitiness. That secondary fermentation didn’t go unnoticed, as several judges including Lynne Sherriff MW enjoyed those baked bread and “toasted brioche” aromas.
Patricia Stefanowicz MW, who also joined our 2017 Masters judging panel, said she found the wine mature on the palate, with “crisp acidity,” while a number of MWs also picked up on its length. With hundreds of entries into our 2017 competition from Italy to the USA, it’s clear that Hush Heath’s rosé can hold its own on the international stage. Cheers!
The wine: Hush Heath Estate Balfour Brut Rosé

Léoville Barton and Grand-Puy-Lacoste led this morning’s 2018 releases, two of the more notable labels to appear post-Vinexpo.
St Julien second growth Léoville Barton was out at €61.80 per bottle ex-négoce, up 17% on the 2017 opener and giving it a case price of £758 per dozen.
With Antonio Galloni, James Suckling and Lisa Perrotti-Brown MW all having given the wine an upper range of 96 points in their scores, this is apparently an effort that rivals the 2016.
The property is on something of a run since 2014 and several of those back vintages, particularly the 2014 and 2017 are available at a considerable discount to today’s release but this is a respected and widely followed label and will no doubt see some interest.
Pauillac cru classé, Grand-Puy-Lacoste meanwhile has continued its new, higher pricing strategy.
Released at €55 p/b, a 4.1% increase on last year it has a case price of £672. Its scores and notes are solid; a wine of “precision, energy and nuance” according to Galloni who gave it 93-96.
Perrotti-Brown, despite calling it “rich, plush and generous”, was more in the 92-94 point spread while Suckling gave it 94-95.
The 2014, 2015 and 2016 all have a 95-point score from Neal Martin so depending on whose palate you tend to follow most the 2018 may be the equal of those vintages and worth a punt but the 2014 and 2015 are below £500 and £600 a case respectively if you know where to find them.
Latour-Martillac, Kirwan and Chasse-Spleen are also out.

The US$1.7 billion deal between Constellation Brands and E&J Gallo is to be delayed after both companies received a request for additional information and documentary material from the US Federal Trade Commission.
On 3 April, Constellation and E&J Gallo entered into an asset purchase agreement over the agreed sale of $1.7 billion worth of wine brands. Constellation intends to offload its wine brands priced at US$11 and below sold, including Clos du Bois, Black Box, Estancia, Mark West, Wild Horse, Franciscan, and Ravenswood, along with six winemaking facilities, to E&J Gallo.
Those wineries include Mission Bell, Turner Road Vintners, Clos du Bois and Wild Horse in California, Hogue Cellars in Washington, and Canandaigua in New York.
On 17 April, the companies filed the relevant forms in connection to the sale and submitted them to the US Department of Justice and the US Federal Trade Commission, according to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976.
However, on 17 May, both firms received a request for additional information from the US Federal Trade Commission in connection with a review of the transactions submitted.
Referred to as the ‘second request’, this extends the waiting period 30 days after both companies have complied with the request from the trade commission. As a result, Constellation expects that the deal will no longer be completed in the first quarter of its 2020 fiscal year (the three months to 31 May 2019), but rather the second half of the 2019 calendar year.
Constellation confirmed that it will continue the normal operation of its entire wine and spirits business until the transaction is completed.
Speaking at the time, CEO and president of Constellation Brands, Bill Newlands, said the deal would allow the company to focus on its premium brands which he said are performing better.
“One of the hallmarks of our success over the years has been our ability to evolve and stay on the forefront of emerging consumer trends,” said Newlands.
“This decision will help enhance organizational focus on a more premium set of wine and spirits brands that better position our company to drive accelerated growth and shareholder value. In turn, Gallo is acquiring a collection of great brands that complement their operational model and business strategy to provide quality products to consumers at every price point.”

Scotch distiller Glenmorangie and its conservation partners are currently hosting an international conference on restoring Europe’s lost oyster reefs.
Native oysters being laid in the Dornoch Firth last year. The oysters are placed on mussel and scallop shells to provide them with solid purchase while they grow.
Taking place in Edinburgh from 21-23 May, the Native Oyster Restoration Alliance (NORA) conference is being attended by marine scientists, conservationists and oyster producers from across the continent.
The aim of the event is to develop a blueprint for the reintroduction of beds of native oysters to the waters of 15 countries, reintroducing millions of the shellfish Ostrea edulis to Sweden, France, Germany, England, Wales, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Croatia.
At one point Europe’s seas were home to vast oyster beds, with one in the North Sea thought to have been at least the size of Wales if not bigger but they were all wiped out by overfishing a century ago. They are now one of the rarest and most endangered marine habitats on Earth.
Capable of filtering huge amounts of sediment as well as nitrogen from the water (a single oyster can filter 200 litres of water a day), oyster beds are essential for water quality and also boost marine biodiversity.
Glenmorangie has pioneered a scheme to reintroduce an oyster reef in the Dornoch Firth near its distillery alongside Herriot-Watt University and the Marine Conservation Society.
The Dornoch Environmental Enhancement Project (DEEP) has already introduced 20,000 oysters to the firth and the aim is to increase this to four million by 2025.
Dr Bill Sanderson, DEEP’s research director and associate Professor of Marine Biodiversity at Heriot-Watt, is chairing the NORA conference at The Royal Society Edinburgh. He said: “This is a game-changing moment for marine conservation. NORA’s pledge to bring back oyster reefs across Europe, opens the door to widespread restoration, with untold benefits for our seas. DEEP’s ground-breaking work in the Dornoch Firth proves that it is possible to return oysters to areas in which they have become extinct.”
Professor Henning von Nordheim, head of the marine conservation department in Germany’s Federal Conservation Agency BfN, added: “When we founded NORA in 2017 in Berlin, we gratefully realised the overwhelming support and eagerness of so many European partners to join this fascinating vision.
“There is a real chance to restore large areas of our over exploited marine ecosystems with native oysters, for the benefit of marine biodiversity and sea water purification all around Europe. In doing so we can learn a lot from each other at this gathering in Edinburgh.”

A microbrewery is to be built inside the walls of Grimbergen Abbey near Brussels after monks finally uncovered the long-lost recipes and brewing techniques recorded in medieval manuscripts.," 22nd May, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/05/grimbergen-abbey-monks-to-brew-beer-from-medieval-recipe/,"22nd May, 2019

A microbrewery is to be built inside the walls of Grimbergen Abbey near Brussels after monks finally uncovered the long-lost recipes and brewing techniques recorded in medieval manuscripts.
Father Karel Stautemas, sub-prior at Grimbergen Abbey, who is studying to be a brewer to join the microbrewery team.
The project has been several years in the making. Last year, the Belgian monks expressed a desire to begin brewing their own beer again, but were unable to locate the original recipe. It was reported at the time that four researchers had been trawling the archives for a year with no success, and were only halfway through the abbey’s collection.
The process had been further complicated by the fact the documents, which date from the 12th century and have survived three fires, were written in Latin and Old Dutch.
After more searching, the recipes and techniques used have been uncovered and will be used to create a series of limited-edition brews at a new microbrewery on site.
After playing a key role in searching for the recipes, father Karel Stautemas, sub-prior of the abbey, is to undertake formal brewing training alongside his other day-to-day roles. He and other fathers of the abbey will support head brewer Marc-Antoine Sochon.
Father Stautemas said: “Beer has always been part of life in the abbey and we are proud of the beers we have today. We’ve really enjoyed reading more about past brewing traditions in the pages of these ancient texts. We’ve spent hours leafing through the books, which are written in Latin and Old Dutch, and have discovered ingredient lists for beers brewed in previous centuries, the hops used, the types of barrels and bottles, and even a list of the actual beers produced centuries ago.
“This new knowledge adds to our brewing heritage and I’m really looking forward to combining this with my training to revive brewing at Grimbergen Abbey. We will continue to study further to learn more of the book’s undiscovered secrets.”
Head brewer Sochon added: “The microbrewery will be a place for us to combine modern, inventive methods with the ancient Grimbergen brewing heritage. We’re excited to use these books to bring back the medieval techniques and ingredients to create new beers that perfectly complement the excellent offering and flavours of the existing Grimbergen beers, such as Blonde, Blanche and Double-Ambrée.”
The range of beers currently produced under the Grimbergen brand share the name of the monastery as well as its phoenix emblem and motto. Beers were first made on site in 1128, however the brewery was moved away from the abbey in the 18th century. It is now made at the Alken-Maes Brewery for the Belgium market while a Carlsberg-owned facility brews it under licence for international markets.
At the launch event at the abbey, Grimbergen unveiled a limited-edition 10.8% ABV Grimbergen Triple d’Abbaye which it said is an example of the type of beer that will be brewed at the microbrewery, once it has been constructed. The beer was aged in whiskey barrels for five months according to a similar technique that was used to brew beers in the 1500s.
The microbrewery, complete with a visitor centre, is expected to open to the public in late 2020. It will also house an on-site restaurant and bar and will have the capacity to produce three million 33cl bottles each year.

"The UK government will ban the sale and use of single-use plastic items like straws, stirrers and cutlery next year."," 22nd May, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/05/the-uk-government-confirms-it-will-ban-plastic-straws-next-year-but-not-in-bars/,"22nd May, 2019

Environment secretary Michael Gove said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) is “taking further action to turn the tide on plastic pollution,” in a tweet on Wednesday 21 May.
“Items such as plastic straws & stirrers are often used for just a few minutes but take hundreds of years to break down,” he said, “ending up in our seas & oceans and harming precious marine life.”
The use and sale of plastic straws will be “banned” in England from April 2020, according to a press release from DEFRA, but they will still be available throughout the UK.
Retailers such as supermarkets will be prohibited from selling single use plastics including straws, but they will still be sold at registered pharmacies.
The initiative is designed to cater for people with disabilities.
Only plastic drinks stirrers will be totally banned from sale – currently 316 million are used a year.
Bars and restaurants will not face a full ban on plastic straws. Hospitality businesses will not be allowed to display plastic straws, but customers will be able to request a plastic straw upon request, and won’t need to prove they have a disability to receive them, according to DEFRA.
The ministry said it  had worked with disability groups “so that they don’t feel stigmatised.”
Kate Nicholls, the CEO UKHospitality, said the trade body’s members “fully support” the new policy, adding that it recognises a “genuine need of some of our customers…by allowing straws for customers upon request, which is a practice that the sector was rapidly implementing or moving towards.”
A number of bar and hotel groups have already started to phase out their own single use plastics.
Hilton said it planned to remove plastic straws from all managed hotels around the world by the end of 2018, as well as axing plastic water bottles from its conference rooms.
Marriott International also said it would ban plastic straws from its hotels worldwide in July last year, shortly after the chain had started planning phase out disposable plastics at its UK sites.
Bacardi was among the first to call time on plastic straws and stirrers, banning their use across its events in 2016 in an effort to reduce waste as part of its ‘Good Spirited’ campaign, and Pernod Ricard followed suit in January 2018.
Bar groups such as Wetherspoon’s have been phasing plastic straws out from their venues since September 2017.
Nicholls added the hospitality sector has “voluntarily made significant progress in reducing the availability and use of plastic straws and stirrers, motivated both by a moral duty and our customers’ environmental concerns.”
The UK government first launched its consultation on a nation-wide plastic ban last year.
Brigid Simmonds, the head of the British Beer and Pub Association, also supported the government’s decision to exempt bars, restaurants and hotels from the ban.
The policy, she said, “recognises the needs of customers with a disability who require plastic straws, so pubs will still be able to provide them on request, adding that the trade group will work with DEFRA to “ensure that the right guidance is put in place for this.”
“The ban will build on the great work already done by pubs to reduce their waste plastic.”

Berry Bros and Rudd, the Queen’s wine merchant, is set to extend its reach to the lucrative commuter market as its confirms plans to supply a new concession in Victoria Station, db can reveal.
Berry Bros & Rudd’s in London Bridge station’s Urban Express
The move comes around a year after the retailer quietly started supplying an Urban Express store located in one of London’s busiest train station, London Bridge, which was later reported by the Daily Mail.
The store, which opened last May, saw the UK’s oldest wine merchant share space with upmarket ‘homemade’ frozen meal supplier and retailer Cook and Foyles bookshop, offers a selection of full, half and quarter bottles designed to appeal to commuters picking up a bottle to take home.
A spokesman for the company confirmed to db today that following a successful trial, the company’s wholesale division would continue its supply-deal with Urban Express.
She also said there were also plans afoot to supply a ‘specially selected’ wine range in Victoria Station.
The move is the latest in a series of ventures that has seen the wine merchant embark on new retail models. In 2017, it opened a new flagship London shop in St James’s that it said was not only larger but “much more finely attuned to modern retail”, coming complete with Enomatic sampling machines and shelving for more than 1,000 wines and spirits. The following year it held it’s first pop-up bar during London Wine Week, which it expanded this year at the Flat Iron Square hub. The pop-up saw it serve a selection of wines from its award winning own-label range, available by the glass, bottle and sampling flights, along with a dedicated Champagne bar.
In March, the retailer called off its search for a new CEO by confirming interim executive chairman Lizzy Rudd in the role permanently to steer the overall strategic direction of the business, after she stepped into the role in January following the surprise departure of CEO Dan Jago.

Vijay Mallya, the fugitive former head of India’s United Spirits, has been forcibly removed from his final connection with high profile international sports.
Vijay Mallya’s control of the Royal Challengers cricket team has been handed to Diageo.
First the former self-styled “king of the good times” lost control of Royal Challengers Bangalore, the Indian Premier League cricket club, which passed to Diageo after it took control of United Spirits in 2012 and which ousted him from India’s biggest spirits group in 2016.
Then last year he ceased to be prime sponsor and co-owner of the Force India Formula 1 grand prix team when it collapsed into administration. Now he has had ownership of the Barbados Tridents Caribbean Premier League cricket franchise forcibly removed from him because of unpaid debts.
Following non-payment of players’ wages and other costs associated with the Barbados team, the franchise has been removed from Mallya and has been passed to the American-based CMG, which led a team of local and international investors to take over the beleaguered franchise and pay the players for last season.
After he fled to London in 2016, the Indian authorities successfully imposed a global freeze on Mallya’s assets, with the High Court in London allowing him £18,000 a week to maintain his lifestyle while he awaits a final ruling on an extradition warrant to face charges of fraud and money laundering in India.
What is expected to be his final appeal is scheduled to be heard in early July.
However, a suit lodged in a separate court by Swiss Bank UBS to repossess Mallya’s luxury mansion in prestigious Regent’s Park in London has been stayed for a year. The bank sought repossession over failure to repay a £20.4 million loan on the property, but the court has given Mallya until April 30 next year to clear his account.
Mallya also occupies a luxury country mansion at Tewin in Hertfordshire.

Diageo’s shares have already risen by more than 20% in 2019 and they jumped by a further percentage point following his presentation, which contained scarcely coded guidance that when the global group announces its results to the end of next month, they will be at the top end of expectations.
Speaking to the invited audience, Menezes said: “Diageo has delivered strong performance over the past two years with consistent mid-single digit organic top line growth; upweighted investment in our brands; as well as organic operating margin expansion and strong cash flows.
“During the same period we have generated attractive total shareholder returns and, from fiscal 17 to fiscal 19 H1, have returned £7bn to shareholders via dividends and share buy-backs.
“As we approach the end of our financial year, we are reiterating our current guidance of delivering organic net sales growth towards the upper end of our mid-single digit range and 175bps organic operating margin improvement over the three years ending 30 June 2019.
“We operate in an attractive industry supported by strong consumer fundamentals. Our strategy remains focussed on delivering sustainable, consistent growth.
“A culture of everyday efficiency has been embedded in the business and we are constantly challenging ourselves for more. Our ongoing focus on efficiency enables us to continue to increase investment in our brands. It will also support other growth initiatives and underpin organic operating margin improvement, creating a self-sustaining platform for growth.
“As we look ahead to the end of fiscal 22 [the end of the next three-year strategy], I expect Diageo to maintain organic net sales growth in the mid-single digit range and to grow organic operating profit ahead of net sales in the range of 5% to 7%.”

I thank all my predecessors, especially Jacques [Peters], who passed on so many things to me. And I thank Jean-Marc Gallot, Veuve Clicquot President, and the other Presidents before him, for their strong support.”
“All my team is dedicated to the continuity of Madame Clicquot motto: ‘Only one quality, the finest’. I’m very grateful for their support along these years. In the coming months, I will concentrate my efforts on the transmission to the person who will replace me and also to the success of the next harvest.”
He didn’t comment on the expected move to Laurent-Perrier next year, and a spokesman for Laurent-Perrier said it were not in a position to make any comment on the story, at the moment. However, the move has been confirmed by another well-placed source in Champagne.
This news about one of the highest profile winemakers in the whole of Champagne, was originally broken by the French journalist Sophie Claeys. It was Claeys who was first with the similarly surprising, if less shocking, news last September, that the newly appointed chef de cave at Piper Heidsieck, Séverine Frerson was leaving Piper after only weeks in the job, to take over from Hervé Deschamps when he retires as chef de cave at Perrier-Jouët. Deschamps has been at Perrier-Jouët since in 1983, and head winemaker there since 1993.
The Veuve Clicquot cellar-master position is traditionally a ‘job for life’. Demarville now 53 is only the sixth man to hold the reigns since 1890 and his five predecessors have all retired in the position, three of them spending over 40 years in the job. One of the nicest people you could wish to meet in Champagne, with a top-class reputation for his winemaking skills, before Clicquot, Demarville worked at G.H. Mumm for around 12 years, making great strides in restoring the reputation of this house’s wines.
The move, if confirmed, represents quite a coup for Laurent-Perrier. And Demarville will become one of the very few winemakers, of any era, to have held the position of chef de cave at three of the best-known houses in Champagne.

Under the new policy, female employees in all markets will be able to take a minimum of 26 weeks of fully paid leave when they become mothers, CEO Ivan Menezes told investors in New York today.
The company is also setting a “global minimum standard” of four weeks paternity leave on full rate of pay across its global business, with a “significant number” of Diageo’s businesses moving to 26 weeks fully paid paternity leave, the company has said.
Diageo’s employees in North America, Thailand, Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, Russia, Colombia, Venezuela, and Australia will all be able to take 26 weeks of paid leave when they become parents.
Diageo’s policy will be rolled out on 1 July in “most countries”, but added that it will be fully adopted by the business gradually throughout 2019.
The new 26-week parental leave plan was first rolled out to Diageo’s workforce in the UK last month. Both men and women employed by Diageo in the UK are eligible for the same fully-paid 26 weeks parental leave, and up to 52 weeks unpaid, retaining benefits. The package is on offer regardless of gender, sexual orientation or whether they become parents biologically, via surrogacy or adopt.
“We are committed to creating a fully inclusive and diverse workforce and we strongly believe that businesses play a significant role in shaping the future of society,” chief HR officer Mairéad Nayager said.
“Global businesses like Diageo must make bold moves on policies and the environments in which their employees work to ensure that the progress people deserve happens.”

Thieves have stolen over 1,000 bottles, many of them grand cru, worth more than £100,000 from Domaine Forey in Burgundy.
The burglary took place earlier this month and, as reported by Decanter, saw the thieves make off with wines from multiple vintages and climats, the majority of them premiers and grands crus such as Clos Vougeot, Echezeaux, Morey-St-Denis and Vosne-Romanée and including many large formats.
The domaine’s Hong Kong importer L’Imperatrice said in an Instagram post said that owner Régis Forey was “heartbroken” and it was not just the “economic damage” that was so awful but the, “the cost included in the work that went into making these wines along with the vision and patience to cellar them for over 20 years”.
L’Imperatrice and UK importer Georges Barbier have also issued a list of the wines stolen (below).
If anyone is approached by someone offering wines from the list it should be reported to the authorities.
Unfortunately, this is not the first time a renowned estate or even a fine wine merchant has been targeted by thieves. Château Palmer, Yquem, Jacques Selosse, Berry Bros & Rudd and others have been hit over the past few years by gangs in what police have often described as “professional” jobs by thieves who know what they are looking for.

A brewery in east London is clapping back at Brewdog’s new Punk IPA ad campaign by encouraging people to take pictures of themselves holding bottles of its own flagship beer to cover the Scottish brewer’s cans in the ads.

Brewdog’s campaign launched last week during an ad break in the latest episode of HBO’s Game Of Thrones. Dubbed the “most honest ad ever”, the brewery put together a 30-second video featuring the word ADVERT  displayed in large font with a can of Punk IPA in front of it while thrash metal music plays.
On buses, the ad is worded ‘ADVERT ON A BUS’ above a picture of a can of the ale.
Brewdog aired its new advert this week.
In response, Forest Road Brewing Co, backed in Hackney, is asking fans of its craft beer to take pictures of themselves holding bottles of its flagship Work IPA to cover the cans of Brewdog in the ads – and then share their images on social media with @forestroadbrew and the hashtag #beerthatworks both on Instagram and Twitter.
Beer fans who follow Forest Road’s orders can claim a free pint from Forest Road Brewing Co’s Tap Room in Hackney by showing their picture to the bar staff.
Aaron Howard, one of the advertising creatives behind Forest Road’s campaign, said Brewdog’s ads are fun, but “not very punk – especially given that they said a couple of years back that they would never advertise.”
“Instead they’ve spent a large amount of money on high profile media placements – which could have been put to much better use. As a self-proclaimed challenger brand they could have used it to say something far more important. But, fortunately for us, what they have done is created the most hijackable ad ever.
“So, in the spirit of good fun, we’ve masterminded a free campaign for a smaller craft brew who can’t afford this type of media coverage. That’s proper punk.”
Pete Brown, founder of Forest Road Brewing Co said: “As much as we love that BrewDog are flying the flag for craft beer, the smaller, independent craft beer breweries like us simply can’t afford to spend this sort of money on media. So we loved the fact that this idea means we can get our name out there for free, and hijacking the Brewdog ad with our beer is a fun way to do it.”
This is not the first time breweries have gone to war in their ads this month.  Following the launch of Carlsberg’s “brave” marketing campaign and a new Danish pilsner earlier last month, Scottish brewer Tennent’s erected a billboard at its Duke Street visitor centre questioning the validity of its claims, directly across the street from a Carlsberg billboard.

The capital’s top sommeliers and restaurant staff attended the awards ceremony on Monday 20 May at the London Wine Fair.
As well as this year’s awards, the occasion marked the launch of the Wine List Confidential 2019 guide, which provides reviews of the top 100 restaurants, bars, clubs and pubs for wine lovers in London, each rated for value, size, range, originality and service.
Meanwhile, a top panel of judges including FT drinks correspondent Alice Lascelles, Evening Standard drinks writer Douglas Blyde, the drinks business editor Lucy Shaw, and famed food instagrammer Clerkenwell Boy deliberated over a wide selection of London’s wine lists for the WLC Awards.
As well as awards for best service, best value, most original list, and best overall, this year new categories were added in order to recognise the talent behind the lists, including two awards for sommeliers: Rising Star and Sommelier of the Year.
2019 also witnessed a new restaurant grab the top spot, with the head sommelier also picking up the gong for Sommelier of the Year.
Commenting on this year’s competition, Lucy Shaw, editor of the drinks business, who chaired the judges, said: “This year the competition for spots on the list is more intense than ever, and we’ve also seen some great variety with hybrid wine bar / merchants, micro lists, sustainable wines and many new and original offerings.
“London is one of the world’s great cities for wine lovers, and we hope the 2019 guide will encourage people to explore some of these excellent wine lists.”

Leading New Zealand wine brand Brancott Estate, part of the Pernod Ricard stable, has launched a new organic and vegan wine range in the UK.

The new Living Land series, which is being listed exclusively by Tesco (RRP: £11), is made from fully organic grapes grown from Marlborough certified by New Zealand’s leading organic certifier, *BioGro.
The series is already available in the domestic New Zealand market where it comprises a Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, a Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris and Chardonnay, but currently only the Sauvignon Blanc will be launched in the UK.
Pernod Ricard’s off-trade channel director Chris Shead said there was a growing desire for organic wines in the market, pointing to
The Drinks Business recent ‘Top 10 Defining Drinks Trends, which put eco-sustainability and the rise of organics in the top spot of drinks trends that have changed the wine world in the last twenty years.
The category [is] on the rise and expected to grow in value by 10.5% and reach £1.15 billion by 2022, according to Nielsen (Nielsen total coverage period ending 23.03.19), Shead pointed out.
Brancott Estate’s chief winemaker Patrick Materman said the launch marked a significant milestone that epitomised the brand’s ongoing commitment to environmental programmes.
“Ever since we first planted Sauvignon Blanc in Marlborough more than 40 years ago, we’ve known our vineyards are our greatest resource. As a founding member of New Zealand’s original sustainable winegrowing initiative, we have strong views on developing and running environmental programmes and have always made a conscious effort to limit any impact on the environment,” he said.
He said the special relationship the team had with the land made it easy to adopt practices that ensure the land is protected and enhanced for the future.
“With our Living Land Series, we celebrate the initiatives that we undertake to preserve the integrity of our vineyards and their environs,” he said.
According to brand owner Pernod Ricard,Brancott Estate is currently the number two New Zealand Wine brand in the UK and accounts for 12.8% of New Zealand’s wine sales (Nielsen MAT 05.01.09) and commanding a higher that average price at £7.01. The brand is also growing 5.6% in value terms, on volumes up 5.9%, it said, with a number of the Brancott Estate lines outperforming the category, including its Terroir Series, which is growing at 45.5%(Nielsen MAT 05.01.09).
Living Land was launched in New Zealand in 2014

Bordeaux estate Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande has unveiled a new look for its grand vin and a redesign of its second label, formerly known as ‘Reserve de la Comtesse’.
The new look was revealed last week during Vinexpo and is meant to both coincide with the tenth anniversary of renovation work at the winery and an official recognition of the property’s sobriquet, ‘Pichon Comtesse’.
Charles Fournier, commercial and marketing director at the estate, explained that the new labels are, “purer and have a more modern feel”.
They also look similar, pointing to a clearer link between the two wines. The bottle shape has been very slightly changed, to be a little more conical.
Formerly known as ‘Reserve de la Comtesse’ and featuring a small portrait of Virginie de Pichon Longueville, the estate’s second wine will henceforth be known as ‘Pichon Comtesse Réserve’.
The changes will be in place from the 2017 vintage onwards.

Pioneering New Zealand restaurant The Providores on Marylebone High Street in London, run by Kiwi chef Peter Gordon, is to close at the end of July.
Peter Gordon will close his pioneering NZ restaurant The Providores in July
As reported by Eater London, the venue, which introduced the flat white coffee and Turkish eggs to London, will close at the end of July after 18 years.
“Being in London since 2001 has been absolutely brilliant, but, we’ve decided that it’s time to close the doors, and so at the end of July we’ll do just that.
“It’s been an incredibly tough decision and we’re sad in many ways, but this is the right decision for us and we want to go out on a high,” Gordon told Eater.
“We couldn’t be more proud of the restaurant we have created. We have had a huge amount of fun and have been an unofficial NZ trade showroom showcasing NZ food, wine and drinks, an NZ way of service, and an NZ vibe,” he added.
Gordon opened The Providores with his business partner Michael McGrath in 2001, which was ahead of its time in the championing of small plates, bounteous brunches and no reservations, all of which have become the norm in the capital.
Since opening, Gordon has built up one of the finest New Zealand wine lists on offer in the UK, shining a light on both big guns and small growers.
The Providores brought Turkish eggs to the capital
The Providores played a pivotal role in introducing urbanites to the delights of lesser-known New Zealand wines from all over the country.
Gordon’s wine roots run deep – he dabbled in winemaking in Melbourne before becoming a chef, and once co-owned a vineyard in North Otago called Waitaki Braids, which made Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris and rosé.
A decade ago he made the bold decision to turn his wine list 100% Kiwi.
“It was always my dream to have a New Zealand-only wine list, but when we opened 18 years ago it was too early to do it, so we steadily built up our collection over the years and decided to take the plunge in 2008,” Gordon told db.
“New Zealand does so much more than Sauvignon and we wanted to show what the country was capable of. Being able to help producers secure distribution in the UK makes us feel like proud parents.
Prior to The Providores, Gordon worked with Fergus and Margot Henderson at St John, and The Modern Pantry’s Anna Hansen at The French House. Both Gordon and McGrath plan to take some time off this summer after the restaurant closes to relax, travel and work on personal projects.

Accolade Park, Europe’s largest wine warehouse and distribution centre, has transferred 50% of its energy to wind power after installing a new 2.5MW wind turbine at its Avonmouth site, in a landmark move for the industry.
Accolade Park ahs become the UK’s first business to install a wind turbine
The move is a first of the UK, as the site is not owned by Accolade Wines itself, and required the approval of both the local planning authorities and the site owners.
According to the company, on-site wind generation has only ever been implemented by companies that own their own property, so the installation of the new 130m wind turbine is a new landmark in renewable energy in the wine industry.
“Getting a wind turbine up on mainland England is a feat in itself but to change the standard is truly exceptional and this landmark case is paving the way for other businesses to source renewable energy,” the company said.
Richard Lloyd, general manager, European operations and supply chain at Accolade Wines said the company was committed to identifying and delivering sustainable operations at the 80,000sq. m site. “The need to source renewable electricity is very evident and having our own wind turbine is a significant part of the solution. We were all determined to make it happen,” he said.
“The wind turbine is a significant step in our journey to create a sustainable business and builds on significant emissions reductions already achieved at Accolade Park.”
Ade McKeon, regional managing director, UK and Ireland, said a company objective was to lead the way in sustainable wine production. “Many customers are recognising the need to reduce carbon emissions across the supply chain by sourcing from sustainable businesses and we are proud to be on this journey with them,” he said.
Accolade Park was built in 2008 on the 35.63 acre site in Avonmouth, and has since grown to become the UK and Europe’s largest wine warehouse and distribution facility, capable of producing 1,200 bottles of wine every minute or 600 million bottles every year. This represents one third of all wine consumed in Britain each year, but the centre is used to import, process, bottle and package wine for the UK market but also acts as a hub to ship wines to mainland Europe. 
In 2017, a group of South Korean investors paid £62 million for the Avonmouth site.

Carlsberg has once again renewed its sponsorship deal with Liverpool F.C., a partnership the Danish beer giant has benefitted from since 1992.

The news comes after the brewer released a bright red pilsner created specifically for Liverpool FC fans last month.
The club’s chief commercial officer said: “We are extremely proud to extend our deep-rooted partnership with Carlsberg to a record-breaking 31 seasons.
“Since 1992 we have enjoyed a long and loyal relationship with Carlsberg and this extension is a real testament to the strong and historic link between the club and the iconic brand.
“We are delighted to have Carlsberg as an established member of the LFC family, and we look forward to continuing to strengthen our relationship together.”
The new deal, which means Carlsberg continues to hold the longest-standing partnership in the Premier League, will see the Danish brand become the club’s official beer until the end of the 2023-24 season.
“The relationship between Carlsberg and Liverpool FC is iconic, and we’re extremely proud to have been a part of the family for over a quarter of a century,” Jessica Spence, Carlsberg’s chief commercial officer, said.
“As Reds fans ourselves, we’re incredibly excited by what the future holds for the club and look forward to using our partnership to deliver exciting experiences for fans around the world.

The fastest growth market for cork stoppers in the past 12 months should surprise those in the wine trade, says Amorim’s Carlos de Jesus.
During a discussion with the drinks business at the London Wine Fair on Monday, Carlos, who heads up marketing and communications for Amorim – which is the world’s largest producer of cork stoppers – said that the growth rates for cork are coming from areas those in the trade might least expect.
Considering figures for Amorim, he told db that the fastest growth market for the past 18 months has been Australia, which he explained, is surprising because it is a wine-producing nation better known for using predominantly screwcaps to seal its bottles.
While admitting that such growth for cork was “off a smaller base than we would like”, he added that the increase was a positive sign for the cork industry.
“People don’t realise that 15-17% of wines in Australia are closed with cork, and the fact is, those making wine at higher price points never stopped using cork,” he said.
Regarding the reasons for such a growth in the number of Australian wine producers using cork, Carlos isolated one major cause for the development.
“What has changed is that China has become the number one destination for Australian wine and that has resulted in the interesting growth we have been observing, to which we need to add the contribution made by sparkling, which is significant,” he commented.
Continuing, he spoke of the significance for the cork industry of the rise of China as a wine consumer, because it is a country where the majority of drinkers want a wine sealed with a cork, and this stopper is the most sustainable on the market today.
“What makes this interesting is that for the first time ever, China has imposed a sustainable packaging solution upon a western country, and the fact that it happened in wine, with cork, with Australia, adds to the interest,” he added.
Stressing the sustainable nature of cork as a stopper solution for wine, he said that each closure retained as much as 392 grams of Carbon Dioxide.
For this reason, he said that wine producers using cork had the opportunity to incorporate “this substantial reservoir of CO2 retention in their own environmental footprint”, which he added, “Is good news for the winery that is trying to reduce its environmental impact”.

The 2018 wines from Chanel-owned Rauzan-Ségla and Canon came through this morning, the price increases on the 2017 were hefty but will their brand appeal and limited allocations see them through?
The Margaux and St Emilion properties are owned by fashion house Chanel and have become firm favourites in recent years not just for the quality of their output but also for their ‘fair’ prices.
There may be question marks around at least one of the duo today however – Rauzan-Ségla.
Out at €72 per bottle ex-négociant, up 36% on the 2017 release price – it has an ex-London case price of £900 per dozen, putting it at the same level as its 2015 which was a famously good vintage in Margaux.
The 2018 has received high praise and for those who follow the scores of Antonio Galloni, Lisa Perrotti-Brown MW or James Suckling who have all scored it in the 97-100 point bracket then it will surely be of interest.
As Liv-ex’s members voted it the third best value wine of the vintage with an expected release price of under £600 a case however, it may look a little toppy.
There are some tempting-looking back vintages such as the 2012 that might pique buyers’ interest if they know of any available but this a ‘brand on the move’ with a potential 100-points from Galloni and allocations are tight this year (there was significant mildew damage) which will probably drive sales regardless.
Rauzan’s cousin Canon meanwhile is on slightly surer footing with a release price of £1,044 per dozen.
It’s a fairly substantial increase on the 2017 release but the scores are very good: 94-97 from Galloni; 97-99 from Perrotti-Brown and 17.5 from Julia Harding MW.
It’s a wine that “bristles with energy and tension” remarked Galloni.
Despite the opening gambit it sits at a discount to the 2015 and 2016. The 2014 and 2011 vintages at under £800 might be worth seeking out but Liv-ex judged the 2018 a ‘fair’ release price and, like Rauzan, it is being offered on allocation and is a brand of the moment so it should sell.
Gruaud Larose was also out this morning at £684 a case which is definitely ambitious and going more off the positive reviews from Suckling and Perrotti-Brown than Galloni’s rather more stoic appraisal (“inky and jammy”).
This is probably one of the bigger missteps of the day if not the campaign so far and it’s hard to see it shifting any major volumes.
Talbot released late yesterday afternoon at £518 a case was also rather eyebrow raising but the scores put it as one of the better if not even ‘the best’ the estate has produced. Buyers may start asking if there’s any 2016 available however at under £500 a case and a 92-point score from Neal Martin.
And finally, Château du Tertre was out at a fairly pricey £360 per dozen. Again, Suckling’s 94-95 point bracket may have been used to justify that but Perrotti-Brown and Galloni were more in the 89-91/2 point area and at that level the 2017, 2016 and 2012 might be rather more interesting for buyers to consider.
Wine Lister did not think there was a particularly strong case for buying either du Tertre or Gruaud Larose at this point. Part of the problem is that both properties have chosen to release at the same price as their 2016s when both of those wines have declined since offered in 2017.

Exports of Beaujolais wines to the UK have continued to rise in the first half of the year, showing increased growth since February.
Compared to the same period in 2018, exports of Beaujolais have risen 35% in volume overall and 9% in value.
From a small base, exports of rosé increased 194% in volume and 120% in value while exports of Beaujolais Villages have increased 22% in volume and 15% in value.
Anthony Collet, marketing and communication director for InterBeaujolais, said: “We are delighted to see continued growth in Beaujolais exports to the UK. With an increased effort on trade activities regionally and looking ahead to our annual tasting next month, we feel confident for the future of this very important market for Beaujolais. There’s a lot of ‘Beaujo’ love in the UK and we look forward to welcoming the trade at the ICA in June.”
The annual Beaujolais trade tasting is taking place on 10 June at the Institute of Contemporary Arts.
There will be wines from 75 producers, 38 of them seeking representation, from across the region’s appellations and crus as well as two masterclasses; one with Natasha Hughes MW looking at winemaking techniques in the region and one with Joe Wadsack on the region’s terroirs.

Scotch and Japanese whiskies led Bonhams’ recent Hong Kong sale, with lots of the Macallan and Dalmore selling for many times over their pre-sale estimates.
The auction’s top lot was a bottle of The Macallan 1928 50-year-old, which went for HK$1.5 million, with a bottle of 59 year-old The Dalmore ‘Eos’ 1951 making HK$1.1m and a 55 year-old Macallan in Lalique sold for HK$1m.
Five bottles of Japanese whiskies including Karuizawa 16 and 18 year-old, Kawasaki 1980 33 year-old and Hanyu 2000 ‘Bar Keller’, made HK$930,000. A single bottle of Hanyu Ichiro’s ‘9 of Hearts’ saw the hammer come down at HK$471,000.
With all of the top 20 lots at the sale taken up by whiskies – mostly The Macallan – wine took rather a back seat but three bottles of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti’s 2009 La Tâche made HK$117,800; six bottles of 2010 Petrus realised HK$198,400 and three bottles of 1998 Screaming Eagle HK$62,248.
Daniel Lam, Bonhams’ Director of Wine & Spirits, Asia, commented: “We are pleased with the result: a sale total of HK$32.5million with top prices led by early Scotch whiskies and the Japanese ‘Ghost Series’ in seven bottles.
“Over 90% of the whisky buyers are private collectors, showing that market confidence continues to be strong. Once again, the sale attracted global participation spanning America, Europe and Asia, with interest from not only Greater China, but also from new whisky markets in Southeast Asia such as Vietnam and Malaysia.
“The result continues Bonhams’ leadership in whisky auctions, and we look forward to our next whisky sale in Hong Kong this summer on 16 August.”

A new pub has opened its doors in Dublin with an unusual twist; it doesn’t serve alcohol.," 20th May, 2019 ",https://p2d7x8x2.stackpathcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/thedrinksbusiness/images/dblogo-red.jpg,https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2019/05/inside-dublins-first-alcohol-free-pub/,"20th May, 2019

A new pub has opened its doors in Dublin with an unusual twist; it doesn’t serve alcohol.

Vaughan Yates is the co-founder of The Virgin Mary, which opened in Dublin – a city that is home to 750 boozers and the Guinness brewery – earlier this month.
The bar serves a range of ABV-free cocktails.
Alcohol-free bars have started to crop up in cities worldwide in recent years, while more and more companies from Diageo to Coca Cola have begun to introduce AF alternatives to cocktails, mixed drinks and beer into the on-trade.
Now The Virgin Mary, which sits on Capel Street, provides a sober alternative to a few pints after work, operating between Dublin’s normal pub hours.

The low-and-no category is one of the fastest-growing sections of the alcohol industry. More than half of Brits who took part in a OnePoll survey last year said they have at least tried a non-alcoholic beverage, while 52% also said that non-alcoholic beers have become more socially acceptable in the past two years.
Hoping to cash in on consumers’ open-mindedness, The Virgin Mary’s shelves are stocked with alcohol-free beer and wines, while the staff have also curated a menu of AF cocktails. Drinks start at €4.50 (US$5, or £3.94), while cocktails are between €7 and €8.

The bar stocks a range of low ABV beers from both mainstream brands and the world of craft, with Heineken’s 0.0% lager sharing space on the menu with a wheat ale from Danish brewer Mikeller.
Punters also have the option to create their own alcohol-free cocktails by combining a non-alcoholic spirits of their choice with any mixer from Irish soft drinks maker Poacher’s.

The pub, located a 10 minute walk from whiskey maker Jameson’s distillery on Bow Street and less than two miles from Guinness’ brewery, has already picked up high profile attention in Ireland and further afield. “There aren’t many, if any, bars set up just as bars that you come into and drink just non-alcohol products,” Yates told the FT. “And you can drive home.”
As well as lager, craft beer and cocktails, the bar has developed a unique alternative to Dublin’s most famous beer.

The bar, headed up by manager Anna Walsh, serves an alcohol-free porter by Dutch label Braxzz, the brand that provided the Great British Beer Festival with its first AF brew in its history. This is topped with nitrogen-charged coffee on tap, producing a white head.

The Wine and Spirit Education Trust has announced that the Level 3 Award in spirits is now open, with bookings being taken for the first courses in the UK and US.
The WSET developed the new course in response to the growing interest and overall growth of the spirits category around the world.
Building on the Level 2 course, the new programme will look in greater detail on production methods from fermentation to distillation and post-distillation and their impact on styles as well as expanding the spectrum to include shochu, baijiu and soju as well.
In addition there will be more in-depth coverage of Scotch, Armagnac, Cognac, rum, Tequila, Mezcal, vodka and gin.
The exam will include a blind tasting exam and a written paper consisting of multiple choice and short written answers.
Course developer Nick King DipWSET, WSET product development manager, Spirits and Sake, commented: “The spirits industry has been crying out for a more advanced qualification in spirits. Candidate numbers for WSET spirits qualifications (Levels 1 and 2) have grown significantly in the last 10 years (from 540 in 2009 to 6,600 in 2019) and are now taught in 33 countries worldwide reflecting growing global demand.
“We are delighted to now be able to offer the industry a Level 3 Spirits qualification that develops candidates’ knowledge and understanding of the category in great depth and also builds their tasting skills, teaching them to identify the structural and aromatic elements that make up a spirit and to make a compelling quality assessment.”
The first course in London will take place from 21-26 October, with further courses in February and June next year.
In the US, a course will take place in Chicago from 26-31 August this year will further programmes being held in Las Vegas this November and New Orleans next April.

The Distilled Spirits Council, the USA’s spirits industry body, said it “welcomed” the news that Canada and Mexico would repeal retaliatory tariffs on American Whiskey in a statement released on Friday 17 May.
Last year US president Donald Trump sparked a trade war with several countries after he implemented a 25% and 10% import tariffs on steel and aluminium respectively from 1 June 2018.
In July, Canada hit back at the tariffs, raising its own duties on more than 250 US-made products – including a 10% tariff on American whiskey.
Meanwhile, Mexico has imposed a retaliatory tariff of 25% on US whiskeys, and China introduced a 25% hike on American whiskey imports.
The EU Commission meanwhile imposed a 25% tariff on imports of Bourbon and American whiskey in July 2018.
Globally, for the first six months of 2018, American Whiskey exports grew 28% to a total of $595 million, according to the Council. However, once the retaliatory tariffs had been enforced, exports during the second half of the year declined by 11%, compared to 2017, to a total of $593 million.
Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the DISCUS, thanked The US government for securing a more amicable deal with “two of our largest and most important export markets. ”
“With this critical issue now resolved, we look forward to joining the various efforts to support the prompt Congressional passage of U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which includes important benefits for our industry.
There has also been a significant slow down of exports to the European Union. The EU, which accounted for nearly 60% of all whiskey exports in 2018, recorded growth of 33% in the first half of 2018, but fell by 13.4% in the second half, as tariffs came into affect.
Swonger added that he hoped the latest update to the US’ export deals would encourage the EU to also withdraw its own 25% import tariff.
He said that the government should “build on this positive momentum to resolve all of the remaining retaliatory tariffs that our US distilled spirits exports face, particularly the European Union’s 25% tariff on American Whiskey.”

Wine businesses are being forced to “waste” cash and working capital preparing for the revised Brexit deadline in October, delegates at the London Wine Fair heard, as the WSTA warned that a no-deal was not firmly “off the table”.
WSTA chief executive Miles Beale.
Speaking at an industry briefing at the London Wine Fair this morning, WSTA chief executive Miles Beale warned that the threat of a no-deal Brexit remained and although many businesses were currently going through a ‘lull’ and winding down stockpiles amassed for the original March dealine, it was likely these would have to be ramped up again later in the year.
Speaking on the panel, Ed Baker of Kingsland Drinks admitted the contingency planning alone had already impacted the business by around 5-10%, (not taking allowance of any long-term trends) and although the majority of the stockpiled drinks the company had prepared ahead of the original March deadline was now being unwound, wine companies in the UK were facing ramping this up again in the autumn.
He said the contingency planning undertaken by the business in advance of the original deadline – including securing extra bulk wine stocks, stockpiling dry goods and also securing increasingly difficult to find warehousing.
“Do I see it happening again this time around? I presume most of our customers will be still be worried and people will want to ensure there is wine on shelves so we have to put contingency plans in place,” he told the LWF conference.
“It’s a waste of cash and capital but it’s what we need to do.”
Michelle Brampton, managing director Europe of Treasury Wine, who recently joined the WSTA board, said stockpiling has been costly to the business and ramping it back up again before the busy Christmas period would involve a lot of planning, but it was “foolish” not to prepare for a “‘potentially difficult” no-deal scenario.
“It’s not the short term, how do we build up the stock, it’s the longer term planning to do be able to have consistency of supply has been ongoing and will continue to be, even if there’s a slight lull and we have to ramp back up again towards the end of the year.”
Metzendorff managing director Andrew Hawes said that it was not quite as simple to repeat the process in the busy months of October, as it was at the end of March, which had been a good time to create a “false peak” in a business that remains quite seasonal.
“If there was a good time, it would have been the end of March,” he said. “Later in the year it’s not as simple to do all that again.
He added that there were issues such of cashflow for suppliers and finding warehouse space as there was a current shortage in the UK and, as previously reported by The Drinks Business, prices had rocketed ahead of the original March deadline.
Hawes said that not every business would be able to plan. “There’s an agreement about what everyone would like to do, but businesses ability to have that is difficerent. If prodcer is from a large international groipu, they can take those decisions, but smaller bsuienssess cannot necessarily take them, whether that’s due to the bank or shareholders. Having already stretched themselves in March, the first priority is to sell those stocks and pay the supplier for them. Looking ahead, repeating that all again later in the year will be doubly tricky.”
WSTA chairman Dan Jago said the ability of businesses to invest in carrying extra stock was “very significant” but banks were currently not in the mood to lend.
Beale warned that Brexit “still could still mean anything” from the status quo to a no-deal where there was “huge disruption”, but said a no deal Brexit in Oct might be less painful than one in March would have been.

Cheap Douro wine sold at discount retailers in the UK is doing “serious damage” to the industry, according to Paul Symington of Symington Family Estates.

Speaking to db after being presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by The Drinks Business and the Institute of Masters of Wine at Vinexpo, Symington said: “Port volume sales are in decline, which is having a big structural impact on the region, as it hasn’t properly adapted to the new commercial reality yet.
“The fundamental issue is about Port grape prices, which are high, while Douro wine grape prices are sold as a by-product at two thirds less than the cost of growing them, which is a suicide mission.
Paul Symington wants to raise the status of Douro reds
“Our yields are 80% lower than in Chile and yet you can find Douro wines on the shelves at Aldi for £5.99, which is utter madness and is doing serious damage to the industry. We mustn’t devalue our region by selling our wine too cheaply.
“These extraordinarily beautiful wines should not be sold at these price points. I’m worried about the economical impact this will have on farmers and am concerned that the way things are done at the moment will damage the region’s future potential.
“There have to be changes to the way things are run in the Douro but there has been a blinding silence from the government so far. For some, there is a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, which is unbelievably short-sighted.”
Symington admitted that dry Douro wines hadn’t thus far been as successful in the UK as he thought they would be.
“I don’t think the answer is being less regulated but regulated in a more effective way. The laws need to be adapted for the 21st century rather than the 1920s.
“My big dream is that Douro wines reach the level of the Super Tuscans in terms of acclaim and recognition. In terms of quality, this is perfectly do-able, but we are tripping ourselves up at the moment, which is deeply frustrating.
“These are astonishing wines that are worthy of being considered in the same bracket as Sassicaia. I’d love to see some of the top Douro reds reaching cult status and trading on Liv-ex.
“The wines have come a long way since the early 2000s – there used to be too much wood and extraction, but we’ve learnt a lot over the last 20 years and we have the authenticity and quality for a few of the top wines to reach cult status,” he said.

iDealwine’s annual assessment of the fine wine auction market shows that Burgundy keeps growing in popularity, while organic and biodynamic brands are also in favour with customers, and Right Bank wines are the ones to watch.

iDealwine’s position as France’s leading online auction platform and a specialist in fixed-price sales affords it valuable insight into the fine wine auction market. The company’s annual analysis of auction performance informs its customers of the latest trends and market evolutions. 
The latest report testifies the growing appeal for mature and rare wines in 2018. iDealwine’s WineDex, which tracks the top 40 Bordeaux grands crus, the top 40 Burgundy cuvées and the top 25 Rhône wines, registered 19% growth across the board.
When compared with the French stock market index, wine appears to be a secure investment. In 2018, 43 auctions were held on the iDealwine platform, attracting the interest of nearly 60 buyer countries. In total, no fewer than 143,000 bottles were sold online. Total sales generated by iDealwine auctions reached €17.46 million (£15.09m), up by 32% on the previous year. All in all, it was another superb vintage for iDealwine.

Burgundy on the rise
Burgundy has been the most attractive, expensive region in France for years, and every year this position is reinforced. Of the 50 most expensive bottles sold in 2018, 42 were Burgundy – the figure was 32 in 2017.
The 2018 record is held by a bottle of Romanée-Conti 2005 sold for €16,173 in December 2018. Collectable bottles from Henri Jayer continue to be fought over at auction: a magnum of Vosne-Romanée 1er Cru Cros Parantoux 1982 sold for €14,592, making it the fourth-most expensive bottle to sell in 2018. Further down the rankings are wines from Henri-Frédéric Roch.
Wines from the Côte de Beaune are emerging, with, for instance, a Volnay Clos des Ducs 1978 from Domaine du Marquis d’Angerville in 55th place (six bottles sold for €6,834).
Although Burgundy’s Pinot Noirs are the most coveted, the white-focused Montrachet appellation also features in the rankings. Despite a year that was once again marked by the relatively stable prices of its crus classés and related crus, Bordeaux was not completely outdone in terms of performance. The volume of Bordeaux wines sold last year at auction on the iDealwine platform is 45%. In 2018, the region owed its success to the great performance of Pauillac’s premier grand cru classé, Château Mouton Rothschild.
On the other hand, prices of Petrus, a hitherto undisputed safe Bordeaux investment, stagnated in 2018, especially for recent vintages. The rise of this Pomerol star is now measured in the medium term. The performance of second wines is an interesting development, as they are beginning to attract an increasing number of wine enthusiasts.

“Please don’t do this if you have a heart condition,” our mentor warns as I dab my little finger into the fine white powder in front of me. “Now, see what you think.”
The room around us is heaving. The amps are booming, there’s still a queue running along the length of the velvet rope that pens us in, and nervous giggles bounce from table to table. On sampling the strange substance, more than a few people can’t resist a furtive grin.
We’re at a WSET masterclass at ProWein. The powder is monosodium glutamate (MSG), a flavour compound often added to Chinese food and processed meats. We’re also given a lemon wedge, a shot glass of salt and four marshmallows. We’re told to place the powder on our tongues and think about how it would react with the three wines in front of us; a Pinot Grigio, a Gewürztraminer, and a Pinot Noir. Once the initial salty taste wears off, there’s a warming sensation not unlike chicken stock or miso soup. Jude Mullins, the managing director of WSET’s operations in Asia, says this is the elusive flavour umami, which in Japanese, translates as “deliciousness”.
Now Mullins tells us to take a sip of the Pinot. “I’m not a nice person,” she says, and it’s soon clear why. The tannins that were already fairly present are now overwhelming. The fruit dies. The bitterness prevails. Basically, it tastes awful. She then tells us to combine the MSG with salt and lemon. Suddenly, sour cherry aromas are brought back to life and the wine turns to silk.
Whether you believe it’s science, fiction or somewhere in between, sommeliers earn their living by doing a far more complicated version of our half-hour masterclass. They taste hundreds (in some cases, thousands) of wines to see what they can match to their restaurant’s menu. Much of the WSET’s curriculum is based on the fine art of balancing salt, fat, acid and alcohol, but there’s a rebellion rumbling in the wine trade.

This year Tim Hanni MW, the vocal American chef, critic and certified wine educator, told a packed room at the 2019 Sauvignon Blanc Celebration in Marlborough that a perfect pairing doesn’t exist, and we’re doing “a lot of damage the way we’re matching wine and categorising it”. He called for a campaign to end the practice altogether, “as we’ve created a lot of bullshit around the idea”. Speaking a few weeks after the festival, Hanni’s prose is more academic. “What I’m actually talking about is the genetics that give us differences in how we perceive sensations,” Hanni says. “Some people have extremely sensitive hearing or eyesight. Others have, if you will, a diminished capacity.” Some people lack certain receptors and have a very high tolerance for bitterness; even high levels of alcohol can taste sweet. At the other end of the spectrum, around 40% of people are extremely sensitive to bitter flavours and struggle with any wine with an ABV higher than 13%.
Plenty of variation
This figure, Hanni says, jumps to between 50% and 70% of the population in Asia. There is also a middle ground, and plenty of variation between the three. “It shows up all the time in every wine competition or judging or when discussing what wine goes with what food.” It is a point that came up at the start of the WSET masterclass at ProWein. Before Mullins began the session, she asked the attendees to place a strip of Phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) paper on our tongues.
PTC is a bitter chemical compound that is intolerable to some people but undetectable to others. Out of the 20 people in the room, five removed the strip of paper immediately, while others took about 30 seconds to do so. Some barely reacted to it at all. Hanni’s issue is not with the concept of matching food to wine itself, but with the ingrained truths that some styles, such as Sauternes, should be served with certain foods, like foie gras or blue cheese, regardless of the individual diner’s tastes. Hanni says this is rarely the case, but “the knee-jerk reaction is somehow that the sommelier has something to lose in understanding the guests they serve, which is actually kind of crazy”.
Master Sommelier Clément Robert, wine buyer and group head sommelier for Caprice Holdings in London, agrees that taste is subjective, but thinks the idea that sommeliers are preventing people from enjoying their meal thanks to their own role in the dining room is simplistic. Wine, he says, hasn’t been over-intellectualised in the way Hanni sees it: “Wine pairings are very simple things. There are good sommeliers and there are bad ones,” he says, as is true in all professions. “A good sommelier should listen to the guest and find something that suits their preference. In any case, they should never impose their opinion.”
It is a view shared, at least in part, by Roger Jones, the chef-owner of The Harrow at Little Bedwyn in Wiltshire, and a keen oenophile. “There are obviously simple things, like how Riesling should go with spicy foods,” he says. The general rule of thumb from WSET is that high tannins and acidity in a wine exacerbates spicy flavours, so the lighter the better, but during a recent pairing competition that Jones helped to judge, buttery Chardonnays came out as the winner with spices. “Chardonnay has always been the perfect match with Indian food. It follows the exact suit of what Indian people would drink with their food,” referring here to yoghurt-based drinks such as lassi or kefir.
The malolactic qualities of some Chardonnay, he says, provides the requisite cooling effect, but the general consensus revolves around light and aromatic serves. So, how can you anticipate a diner’s tastes? Hanni uses me as an example. “Do you drink coffee or tea?” Coffee, I reply. He asks if I take sugar or milk, or both. “There are very simple things we can ask and listen to for prompts that can give us quite good insight into what kind of sensory world a person lives in.”
 
Small plates
Getting to know your diner and their tastes may be a rewarding challenge, but it’s not the only thing somms must consider, especially in today’s dining culture. Speaking at the same Sauvignon Blanc celebration in Marlborough, Hong Kong-based MW Sarah Heller announced that our modern tradition of food and wine pairing is “a waste of time” in Asia, as there is a lot of eating off a Lazy Susan in a banquet setting, involving lots of courses that are only on a table for a bit. “Sommeliers should think more holistically about the style of cuisine being served and how certain wines pair with the sweetness and acidity levels in the food.”

Granted, lumping all the culinary cultures of one continent with cuisines as diverse as those from China, Vietnam, Japan, Korea or Nepal, and all of their subregions, is simplistic at best, but historically the tradition of serving multiple dishes at once is more ingrained in some parts of the world than others. Conversely, matching one alcoholic beverage to one plate of food is also more ingrained in certain areas, and this, Heller says, is where problems arise. China is a fast-growing and increasingly attractive market for fine wine producers, but sommeliers in Asia, she says, will need a different approach to sourcing and selection compared with their peers in Europe.
“Matching one wine to a meal can create a lot of anxiety,” she tells the drinks business a few weeks after the symposium, “and the idea that you have to have these strict rules takes much of the enjoyment out of the whole process.” There are a few ways to approach this. “It’s all about compromise,” says Robert, referencing the myriad pleasures Sherry can bring to a meal.
Tapas also has the potential to throw up issues when it comes to matching drinks, but, as he notes, many of these dishes share common themes, such as certain herbs or punchy garlic. “This means that a Sherry, with all its oxidative flavours and acidic profile, can go with most things fairly well on the list.” When it comes to service, restaurants are becoming more adept at catering to those needs. Robert and Jones both advocate wine flights, which are made possible by more wineries moving to aluminium closures, or expensive tech like Coravin’s preservation solutions found in such high-end haunts as 67 Pall Mall. Additionally, Robert says, it is “great to see so many restaurants serving their wines by the glass now”.
 
Modern affectation
Hanni’s comments may have caused a stir in February, but the MW has done his homework. During our interview he name-drops the culinary tome Larousse Gastronomique, and insists I find the first edition from 1938.
“It’s been my Bible since I was 14,” he says. The takeaway point is that the idea of matching one wine to one dish is a modern affectation. There is a section when you come to the main courses, he says, that details the wines you could serve, “such as Lafite, Romanée-Conti and Côte-Rôtie,” but he said the tome adds that “if the guests prefer the wines of Sauternes, they are more than welcome to imbibe those instead.” More recently, Hanni put this into practice in Marlborough when he suggested that drinking Sauvignon Blanc with a steak is far from a crime.
Whether a modern concept or not, there’s clearly a demand for it. “Look, Sometimes I just want to enjoy a wine with a steak and to not really think about it,” Robert admits, but adds that that’s not really the point. “If you go into a fine dining restaurant, the people you are serving go there because they have a genuine interest in what is being served.” House reds and whites are offered for a reason: not everyone wants to pursue the elusive ‘perfect pairing’, but other diners do. They might be interested in the food more than the wine, or vice versa, but Robert defends their right to have intellectual curiosity about their meal, especially when some are paying upwards of £200 per head. Luxury, he believes, “can be an intellectual experience.”
 
Diverse pairings

The craft beer movement is nearing adolescence in the UK, and has evolved to extend beyond the micropub and into dining rooms. Last October, beer writer and certified Cicerone Melissa Cole published The Beer Kitchen: The art and science of cooking and pairing with beer, offering a fresh take on food and drink that can be applied at home, but even London’s high-end on-trade is getting in on the act. In February, db visited Michelin-starred Alyn Williams at The Westbury in London to road-test the chef’s beer pairing menu, which the restaurant has offered since it opened in 2011.
“You could say we were a bit ahead of our time,” he told our reporter. There, we found oysters and dill granita paired with Helles lager, and squab pigeon with beetroot ketchup accompanied by a milk stout. Williams may have been a trailblazer at the start of the decade, but an increasing number of UK chefs are catching on. Tom Kitchin, the chef-owner of his eponymous Michelin-starred restaurant in Edinburgh, as well as Castle Terrace and others, collaborated with Isle of Skye Brewing Co. to create a pale ale, Yer Ben, that is sold in his restaurants. Last year, he told db that wine and beer can complement each other by “offering a different approach to food matching”.
Kitchin said he’s planning to add one dish with a beer pairing option to his tasting menu. “Some beers with higher ABVs are slightly richer and darker and therefore complement winter meat dishes, or a sweeter beer could be used to match a dessert.  At Castle Terrace, a classic combination to start would be oysters and dark beer – Loch Fyne Brewery does a great example of this with its Sanda Black IPA – and we are planning to add one dish with a beer pairing option to our tasting menu.”
Kitchin said he gives his staff an education in beer akin to a somm’s own vineyard expeditions, with in-house staff training and tastings, as well as regular brewery tours. Breweries of other kinds are also grabbing restaurateurs’ attention. Saké is growing in popularity in the on- and off-trade in the UK. According to Japan’s National Tax Agency, exports to the UK rose by 63% from 2012 to 2017 – from 238,000 litres to 388,000. WSET even introduced a Level 1 course on saké in 2016, which can be followed up by the Level 3 award that started accepting more advanced students in 2014. Since then, restaurants like Hide in Mayfair have made a point of including saké on their menus, and Japanese tea room Katsute100 in Islington sells a wide range of saké.
Could this provide the on-trade’s food pairing tradition with a breath of fresh air? “Of course,” says Robert. “If you look at the way saké and spirits have taken off in WSET, there is a strong desire from sommeliers for more education around these diverse topics.” Sommeliers like Robert may be open to adding more beers onto their menus and broadening diners’ experiences, but chef Roger Jones says, logistically, it’s not that easy for restaurants to accommodate just yet. “Beer pairings are great,” he says, “but I can’t sell a glass of beer for £68; it’s not in the same bracket as fine wines. Then you need to think about storage. At our restaurant we do very limited beer sales because we’d lose money.”
 
Perfect Pairing
If we’ve learned anything in the past three months, it is that it’s all too easy to create a war out of something that brings joy to so many. Every interviewee has their own perfect pairing they’re keen to share and wax lyrical about. Pairings, Robert says, are “great if people want to enjoy them, but then again it’s very important not to impose them”.
The perfect match, then, is the Schrodinger’s cat of fine dining. Hanni says it doesn’t exist, and Mullins agrees, but adds that a combination of a certain wine with certain food “could be perfect for that person. It’s all subjective”.
Roger Jones notes that, even if a Sauternes chimes perfectly with a cheesecake for a certain diner one day, “it could just be the day their boyfriend proposes to them. If a diner comes in a rubbish mood, nothing is going to make them happy.” The important point is that pairings, perfect or otherwise, are meant to be fun. “Nothing on a table is more important than the people around it,” Jones says. “Everything must be in perfect harmony”, from the bottle on the table, or the company you keep. db

Luxury group LVMH has joined the rosé bandwagon with the purchase of Chateau du Galoupet in the south of France.
 
It is the first time the group, which owns Champagnes Veuve Clicquot and Dom Pérignon as well as Hennessy Cognac, has bought a winery specialising in Provence rosé.
Chateau du Galoupet, a winery in France’s Provence region dating back to the 17th Century, covers 68 hectares of vineyards, mainly producing rosé wine.
LVMH’s portfolio of wine and spirits labels have driven strong sales growth in recent years. It reported a 10% increase in revenue across in 2018 reaching €46.8 billion, with its wine and spirits division contributing €5.1 billion.
The luxury goods group, which is the largest of its kind in the world, bought a controlling share of cult Napa estate, Colgin Cellars, in November 2017, already owning the Newton Vineyard wine estate, which is based in St. Helena.
According to a recent report jointly published by FranceAgriMer and the Interprofessional Council of Vins de Provence, global still rosé wine consumption has grown steadily for the past 15 years (+28% between 2002 and 2017).

California vintners are not ageing their top wines for long enough due to a desire for instant gratification in the US, according to Gallo winemaker Chris Munsell.
Chris Munsell of Gallo would like to see more California wine aged for longer before release
Speaking to db during a recent visit to California, Munsell, the director of winemaking for Gallo Family Vineyards, said he’d like to see more California wines aged for longer before release.
“We don’t age wines for long enough in California. There is a culture of instant gratification in the US.
“When it comes to the wines in our portfolio, we have to figure out with each wine when we want it to be drunk, then we have to figure out how to sell it and market it.
“The majority of the wines in the Gallo portfolio are designed to be drunk within five years but things are changing.
“While the company has traditionally focused on wines designed to be dunk within a few years, Gallo has been busy building up its portfolio of wines designed to be laid down.
“A decade ago Gallo used to sell 85% of its wines in the off-trade, and now it sells 65% to the off-trade and 35% to the on-trade, so that dynamic is changing too.”
Over in London at a masterclass on the evolution of South African Chardonnay held at the London Wine Fair this week, DeMorgenzon winemaker, Carl van der Merwe, stressed the importance of making wines that are both approachable on release but have the capacity to improve with age.
“I want to make wines that are delicious on release but that also get more interesting with age, which is a big challenge.
“In today’s wine market producers have to be making wines that are completely drinkable on release – there’s no excuse for that not to happen,” he said.
Andries Burger, chief winemaker at Paul Cluver Wines, echoed his sentiments. “We need to make wines that are approachable now but will also age gracefully, which is one of our greatest challenges as winemakers.
Carl van der Merwe of DeMorgonzon in Stellenbosch, South Africa, believes wines should be both delicious on release and also need to improve with age
“Not many estates have the space or the capital to store their wines for a long time before release,” he admitted.
However, Lia Poveda, global ambassador for Bouchard Finlayson, believes the consumer desire for long aged wines is dwindling.
“At Bouchard Finlayson we are adapting our wines to what the market wants and I think ageing wine is becoming less important to consumers.
“People want fresh wines that are ready for drinking on release – there’s more pressure than ever on winemakers to make ready to drink wines,” she said.
She also revealed that the estate now starts fermenting its Chardonnay in stainless steel tanks rather than barrel, moving the wine to barrel for the malolactic fermentation, in order to make a more modern style of Chardonnay where the oak is better integrated.
“We still have a lot to learn when it comes to Chardonnay in South Africa. We’re not as cool a region as we think we are. We’re not Burgundy – Chardonnays have naturally higher alcohol levels,” Poveda said.
In order to obtain optimum freshness and elegance, Burger at Paul Cluver shuns MLF altogether. For van der Merwe of DeMorgenzon, the secret to making quality Chardonnay in South Africa lies in finding spots that cool down significantly at night.
“You need cool evening temperatures to make great Chardonnay. It does something magical to white wines and gives them a precision and elegance that you don’t find in warmer years,” he said.
Back in Napa, Munsell of Gallo told db that the classic California Chardonnay style made with 100% new oak that undergoes malolactic fermentation is still popular in the US. “I love Chardonnay for its ability to hold all that winemaking influence so well,” he said.
As for Sauvignon Blanc, Munsell said that California winemakers were taking a leaf out of New Zealand’s book and moving towards a racier style of Sauvignon rather than the Fumé Blanc style with barrel influence and Semillon in the blend that used to be popular in California.
“New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is on fire at the moment in the US as consumers move towards liking that cooler, racier style of Sauvignon. More producers in California are making high acid Sauvignons that works well as an apéritif with its crisp notes of citrus and grapefruit,” he said.

Reports have emerged that claim the asking price for Majestic Wine’s retail estate is £100 million, and that private equity firm OpCapita, the former owner of electronics chain Comet, is one of the shortlisted bidders.
According to a report by Sky News on Monday, OpCapita, which was founded in 2006 by American financier Henry Jackson, is on the list of shortlisted bidders for Majestic’s 200-strong retail estate.
The bidders have allegedly been told that £100 million is the sum required to seal the deal. Sources told the news site that Majestic hopes to select the successful bidder by mid-June.
Majestic told the drinks business in March that it plans to publish a further update in June where, among other things, the fate of Majestic Commercial and fine wine arm Lay & Wheeler will be revealed.
The capital from the sale will then be used to pursue “significant growth opportunities in Naked Wines”, Majestic said.
As it stands the company is made up of four arms: Majestic Retail, Naked Wines, Majestic Commercial and fine wine specialist Lay & Wheeler.
OpCapita’s current investment portfolio includes Italian dining chain Rossopomodoro, Spanish footwear and accessories retailer Merkal Calzados, betting platform The Football Pools, and German clothing retailer AppelrathCüpper.
Majestic announced it would close stores and rebrand as Naked Wines in March. CEO Rowan Gormley told db that the business wanted to concentrate on its growing online wine subscription service, saying that while it may not be the “comfortable” thing to do, it gave the business more options.
Speaking at the time about what he thought would happen to the stores due to be sold off, he said: “My expectation is that Majestic will keep as an on-going concern, which is fundamentally different to an LK Bennet, which was game over.
“It may be split 10/90 one way, or 90/10 another way or 50/50, it doesn’t matter – but there will likely to be two businesses at the end of this, one of them is Naked, one of them is Majestic. They will still have a bunch of customers and there will still be opportunities for suppliers, and everyone else.
“It’s a profitable business, and therefore it’s not in anyone’s interest to be shutting down a profitable business. What we’re saying is it is won’t be part of this business.”
In April, a former Majestic store in Wakefield was rebranded with the Naked Wines logo. Majestic confirmed that this is a trial and that the shop was now selling a mixture of stock from both Majestic suppliers and also Naked Wines.
The retailer told db at the time that there were no more plans to transition any more stores, but it had not ruled out changing more stores to Naked Wines in the future.

British luxury car maker Rolls-Royce has unveiled a £37,000 Champagne chest which comes complete with four V12 engine-inspired flutes, two “thermal caviar caissons”, two blini holders, two mother of pearl caviar spoons and a canapé capsule.
The Champagne chest is the latest addition to Rolls-Royce’s accessory portfolio, a range that also includes a wood-lined cigar humidor, lambswool floor mat, picnic hamper and parasol.
The chest is said to be suitable “for the most extravagant of environments, from a superyacht to the terrace of a private residence”.
The chest is made from aluminium and carbon fibre, coated with black leather and Tudor oak, reflecting the materials used in Rolls-Royce cars. “Naturally, should a patron wish to create a bespoke colour-way, this would of course, be possible,” the statement adds.
The chest opens at the touch of a button to reveal a wooden serving tray with a laser-cut stainless steel inlay. It contains four hand-blown crystal Champagne flutes, said to have been inspired by the V12 engine, each boasting a polished aluminium base etched with ‘RR’.
Also included are four embroidered napkins, two red leather ‘hammocks’ for holding glasses or bowls, Champagne coolers made from black anodised aluminium and carbon fibre, two thermal caviar caissons (each with space for a 30g tin), two blini caissons, three porcelain bowls in a matching thermal canapé capsule, and two mother-of-pearl caviar spoons, which attach magnetically to the ‘hammocks’.
The chest, which lights up when opened, is available from dealerships at a starting price of £37,000.

The practice of barrel fermenting and oak ageing rosé goes against the philosophy of the wine, according to François Matton of leading Provence estate Château Minuty.
François Matton, co-owner and managing director of Provence estate Château Minuty, believes oak has no place in rosé
Speaking to db at Vinexpo Bordeaux last week, Matton, co-owner and managing director of Château Minuty, said he’s anti the idea of oaked rosé.
“I’m not a fan of oaked rosé and would never barrel age my rosé as I feel it goes against the philosophy of the wine. Provence rosé should be easy to enjoy, not simple but easy.
“With Provence rosé you want lightness, freshness and elegance, you don’t want tannins from the wood. When it comes to rosé I think most of the work should be done in the vineyard not the winery. Provence rosé is at its best when drunk within a year so there is no need for oak,” he said.
François Matton with a bottle of Minuty 281 rosé at Vinexpo Bordeaux
One of the most expensive rosés made in Provence, Château d’Esclans’ Garrus, spends 10 months in oak and retails for around £90 a bottle.
As for the practice of putting ice cubes in Provence rosé, Matton is all for it. “I’m not snobby about people putting ice cubes in rosé, as it’s important that rosé is enjoyed chilled – there’s nothing worse than warm rosé,” he told db.
Keen to move the Provence rosé category into the prestige Champagne sphere, a few years ago Matton developed a top rosé made predominantly from 25-year-old Grenache wines using a clone unique to the estate.
“I wanted a luxury bottle to go with it so I approached perfume bottle designer Hubert de Malherbes, who is best known for creating Dior’s J’adore perfume bottle. I think there are a lot of similarities between perfume and rosé.
“The blue colour used on the bottle is inspired by the deep blue the sky turns when the Mistral wind blows through Provence. It’s a really specific shade.
“We called the wine 281 after the Pantone number of the royal blue colour that drips down the left hand side of the bottle. It looks like wax but it’s not.
“I wanted the bottle to stand out from a distance. Rosé is usually drunk from an ice bucket, so it was important to make sure the neck of the bottle made a visual impact,” Matton said.
Minuty produces 50,000 bottles of 281 priced at £50. France is the biggest market for the wine, which is on pour at Chiltern Firehouse in London.
Founded in 1936, Château Minuty is run by Matton and his brother Jean-Etienne. Matton welcomes the recent influx of rosé producers to the region, so long as they are quality focused.
The Minuty 281 bottle was designed by Hubert de Malherbes, who created Dior’s distinctive J’adore perfume bottle
“I don’t mind that Provence rosé is trendy now and that there are a lot of new players in the game as the average quality level is great.
“You can’t avoid or stop competition so you may as well embrace it. We’re not fighting for the volume share – we’re focused on quality. Our rosés range from €15-50. Minuty is considered the Champagne of rosés.
“As Provence rosé becomes increasingly popular, I hope that quality can be maintained across the region, but it’s human nature to chase the easy money and go down the volume route. In the long term I’m not worried as these brands won’t last,” Matton told db.
He believes part of Provence rosés surging popularity lies in the aspirational lifestyle attached to the wine.
“Rosé is a way of life and it’s very much a lifestyle wine, which appeals to millennials. When you drink rosé you dream of being on a terrace in Cannes or nice watching the sunset – you’re drinking the lifestyle.
“Rosé used to just be popular in the south of France in the summer and now it’s popular all over the world all year round. I don’t think Provence rosé is a fad; it’s here to stay.
“It’s an easy wine to enjoy and people tend to drink it when they’re on holiday in the Côte d’Azur, so it is associated with happy memories,” he said.
“Another reason Provence rosé has become so popular is because it’s versatile with food and pairs well with lots of different cuisines, from Peruvian ceviche to spicy Thai food. It even pairs well with oysters,” he added.
Château Minuty produces seven million bottles of rosé a year and Matton has his sights set on conquering the Chinese market. “Rosé is not popular in China yet – they don’t seem to care about it, but we’re ready when they do take an interest.
“My big aim for Minuty is to become the number one rosé brand in the world and be on sale in the top restaurants, bars and hotels in every export market. Cracking the US market is a big focus for me at the moment,” he said.

US auctioneer Hart Davis Hart recently hosted its largest ever ‘Celebration of Burgundy’ sale which realised US$7.7 million (£6m).
The sale, which took place over two days, was 100% sold with over 200 different Burgundian domaines represented.
As one might imagine there was a high proportion of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti at the sale, spanning 73 vintages back to 1942 and covering all of the domaine’s grand cru sites.
The sale’s top lot was a Jeroboam of 2001 Romanée-Conti which went for a record-breaking $95,600, while eight other DRC lots were counted in the sale’s top 10 results and the consigned DRC made $1.8m in total.
There were impressive results for other wines as well however, with six bottles of Domaine Dujac’s 2014 Romanée-St-Vivant making $20,315 and four magnums of Prieuré-Roch’s 2002 Chambertin Clos de Beze realising $14,340.
The 159 lots of Armand Rousseau made $762,828 in total; 87 lots of Jacques-Frédéric Mugnier’s wines made $377,058 and 22 lots of Clos du Tart realised $65,725.

Wines of Argentina is due to hold a summer solstice trade tasting in London this June, focusing on the country’s white, rosé and sparkling wines.
Part of this year’s Barullo Sessions, an event series which highlights the producers making “special, unique wines” beyond easy-drinking reds, the event follows a similar tasting held last year.
Due to take place at Fora Borough, the event aims to highlight Argentina’s drive to “rediscover its terroirs” and its focus on refining its white offering.
Among the wineries already signed up to exhibit their wines are: Alpamanta estate, Bodega Atamisque, Bodega Norton, Bodega Piedra Negra, Bodegas Krontiras, Casa de Uco, El Esteco, Finca Flichman, Finca la Anita, Bodega Enrique Foster, Kaiken, Los Haroldos, Masi Tupungato, Renacer and Susana Balbo Wines.
Commenting on the wines on offer at the tasting, Europe and UK ambassador for Wines of Argentina, Phil Crozier, said: “New plantings of a wide range of varietals, complement older vine Sémillon, Chardonnay and of course Torrontés. Perhaps the greatest strides Argentina has made is in fresher, more friendly styles, and this is no more evident than in their white wines.
“Lighter styles of rosé and a long tradition of sparkling wine goes back a long way in Argentina’s history. Latin America has a huge thirst for sparkling wines and so they form a major part of almost all winery portfolios in Argentina.
“With a ‘less is more’ philosophy holding court, especially with Argentina’s new, young breed of winemakers – and an increasing movement towards new, cooler climes, such as the Atlantic Ocean and Patagonia – there is new confidence in making distinctive, quality white wines. This summer themed wine tasting is sure to produce some surprises.”

The restaurateur behind two of Mayfair’s most famous restaurant-bars, Mourad Mazouz, has teamed up with a former head bartender at the Savoy’s American Bar in London to help him realise his dream of launching his own venue this week.

Erik Lorincz is returning to London to head up the new at  high-end north African Momo restaurant, the sister restaurant to Mazouz’a Michelin-starred resto Sketch.
Kwānt (the phonetic spelling of ‘Quaint’, according to an emailed statement), is the first solo venture from multi-award winning bartender Erik Lorincz, who helped bring The Savoy’s American Bar to the number one spot at The World’s 50 Best Bar Awards in 2017.
Lorincz joined the American Bar as head bartender when the hotel re-launched after an extensive refurbishment in 2010. It was named the best bar in Europe under his stewardship in the 2016 in the World’s 50 Best Bars list, placing second in the world behind New York’s Dead Rabbit.

He left in May of last year after nearly eight years of service, telling the drinks business that he had ambitions of launching a venue of his own.
The new bar comes as Momo celebrates 22 years of business, “and will include extended terraces and newly sumptuous interiors,” a spokesperson said, as well as new 19th Century-inspired cocktail bar Kwānt.

UK television chef Jamie Oliver’s restaurant business is preparing to file for insolvency, putting around 1,300 jobs at Jamie’s Italian, Fifteen and Barbecoa at risk.
As reported by Sky News, the restaurant chain Jamie’s Italian and the celebrity chef’s other venues have called in a KPMG to handle the insolvency process, with further details to be announced later today.
23 Jamie’s Italian outlets alongside restaurants Fifteen and Barbecoa are said to be affected. Jamie Oliver Holdings, which operates Jamie Oliver Limited and Jamie Oliver Licensing Limited will continue to trade as normal, as will the international restaurant franchise business, Jamie’s Italian International Limited.
The administration comes only two years after Oliver’s business went through a restructuring to offload unprofitable sites.
Oliver said: “I am deeply saddened by this outcome and would like to thank all of the staff and our suppliers who have put their hearts and souls into this business for over a decade. I appreciate how difficult this is for everyone affected.
“I would also like to thank all the customers who have enjoyed and supported us over the last decade, it’s been a real pleasure serving you.
“We launched Jamie’s Italian in 2008 with the intention of positively disrupting mid-market dining in the UK high street, with great value and much higher quality ingredients, best in class animal welfare standards and an amazing team who shared my passion for great food and service. And we did exactly that.”
The announcement follows a number of other restaurant chain closures including Carluccio’s, Prezzo, Giraffe and Ed’s Easy Diner.
According to data consultancy Kantar, diners in the UK are increasingly expressing a preference for experiential outlets rather than full-service restaurants such as Jamie’s Italian. For the year ending 24 March 2019, full-service restaurants experienced a 6% decline in sales, while almost five million fewer trips were made to such sites in the 12 weeks to 24 March 2019, in comparison to the same period last year.
Venues such as cafés and coffee shops, however, have experienced growth of 8% in the year to 24 March.

Cru World Wine has announced it is to implement a new sustainability plan to help lower and off-set its carbon emissions.
The plan is part of a new wave of initiatives the merchant plans to implement to help tackle its environmental impact.
These will include an annual Environmental Impact Assessment and on-going efforts to reduce its carbon footprint.
The newly implemented plan has four main components:

Reduction of unnecessary stock movements: with storage in Singapore, Bordeaux, Hong Kong and London, from 1 June Cru has said it will offer lower purchase prices to clients who choose to store their wine in the warehouse location where the wine first lands.
Consolidation of deliveries: Cru will encourage clients to consolidate deliveries by increasing its minimum order value for free delivery.
CO2 emissions published: Cru will publish on its website the amount of CO2 produced by each stock movement and delivery so clients can better understand their environmental impact and plan their transfers and deliveries accordingly.
Carbon off-setting: Even with the above changes implemented, Cru estimated it will still generate 250 tonnes of CO2 per year so it has committed to offset these emissions entirely through a VTS-certified carbon reduction programme.

Agustin Huneeus Jr., the former CEO and president of Huneeus Vintners, has pleaded guilty to offering a bribe to alter test scores and get his child a sports placement at a university.

Huneeus pleaded guilty to charges at Boston federal court on Tuesday (21 May) which involved paying US$50,000 for someone to alter his daughter’s SAT scores and bribing a member of the University of Southern California athletics department a further $250,000 to secure a place on the water polo team.
He paid the $50,000 sum to alter the exam results in 2018 and made an initial $50,000 payment to the USC official before he was arrested.
Huneeus, who has already stepped down from his position at his wine company, has accepted the charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; supervised release for three years; a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater; a mandatory special assessment of $100; restitution; and forfeiture to the extent charged.
In a written statement delivered outside court Huneeus expressed remorse and apologised to students who secured their place “on their own merit”.
“With my plea today, I am taking full responsibility for my wrongful actions,” he said. “My life has been devoted to my family and the people I have worked with and for. I have disappointed them all and brought shame on myself and the people I love.
“While I wish I could go back and make different and better choices, of course I cannot. What I can do now is to say: I am sorry and I apologise. Beyond my circle of family, friends and colleagues, I also apologise to students who work hard to get into college on their own merit, as well as to their families.
“Today’s plea was an important step in my effort to take responsibility and accept the consequences for acts that I deeply regret, and I hope that with time and effort, I will be able to earn back the respect of the people whose trust I have betrayed.”
Prosecutors have recommended that Huneeus serve 15 months in prison and receive other financial penalties. He will be sentenced in October.
Huneeus and Gordon Caplan, a former partner at a New York law firm who also entered a guilty plea on the same day, are the 12th and 13th defendants to plead guilty to charges as part of the scandal.
The scandal, which was first made public in March this year, centres around William “Rick” Singer, 58, of Newport Beach, California. Singer owned and operated Edge College and Career Network, a college counselling and preparation service, and was the CEO of the Key World Foundation (KWF), which claimed to be a charitable institution that provides education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
It has been alleged that between 2011 and February 2019, Singer conspired with parents, athletic coaches, a university athletics administrator and others to secure placements for students at top universities. These include Yale University, Georgetown University, Stanford University, the University of Southern California, and Wake Forest University.
As well as Singer, 33 parents and 13 coaches and business associates have been charged for their involvement in concealing bribes and fixing test scores. The total number of people charged in relation to this scheme is 50.
Singer was charged with racketeering conspiracy, money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of justice. He pleaded guilty in court in Boston in March.
Marci Palatella, founder and owner of Preservation Distillery in Kentucky, and Gregory Abbott, founder and chairman of New York food and beverage distributor International Dispensing Corp, have also been arrested and charged for their involvement in the scandal. At the time of writing, they have yet to submit a plea.

The Wine Society has launched a new series of limited-edition private-label wines championing exceptional ‘under the radar’ grapes.
The Bin Series, which is available now, will flag up wines the buyers think are ‘worthy’ of the accolade of the new series and harks back to the Wine Society’s heritage of discovering new wines.
Each ‘Bin’ will be available for a limited time, on a ‘when it’s gone it’s gone’ basis. Depending on the parcel size, it will stock “100s of dozens of bottles rather than 1000s of dozens,” it told db. Although it would not bring a bin back in future, it said that if a particular wine proved very popular, the Society would consider adding a future vintage to the range under its grower’s label.
Head of Buying Pierre Mansour told db that throughout its history, the Wine Society had quietly innovated with its cutting edge wine range, citing it being the first merchant in the 1960s to ship Musar from Lebanon, pioneering en rama Sherry in the UK and being instrumental in persuading Gonzalez Byass to release their first Tio Pepe en rama exactly 10 years ago.
“With the Bin Series our aim is to be bolder and prouder about unusual grapes or off-the-beaten-track regions, that pass our quality-first approach to wine buying,” he said.
The first wine in the series, Bin #001 comprises a 2017 Bobal from producer Altolandon in Spain’s DO Manchuela, which Mansour described as “an under-the-radar gem that bowled me over”.
The Society described it as “intensely rich red with generous blueberry and spice flavours, made from Spain’s native bobal grape” and noted the approach to winemaking by producer Rosalia Molina and her husband reflected a growing and exciting trend in Spain that puts the vineyard and quality of grapes at the heart of everything they do.
“Old vineyards (up to 140 years) and high altitude (1100m) results in grapes that have near perfect balance between flavour ripeness and freshness. They then take a light touch in the winery- no fining, no chemicals, tiny amounts of sulphur- so their wines are unadulterated expressions of the natural characteristics of the vines,” it said.
A second wine in the series is already in planning for the summer.
Earlier this month The Wine Society reported turnover in excess of one hundred million pounds for the first time, after seeing a 3% increase in sales despite against a tough backdrop for booze retail in the UK.
he Society said it believed its business model – as a not-for-profit organisation that is owned by and sells to its membership – “frees it from many constraints that companies are bound by, allowing it to operate in a different way to its competitors”.

One of the properties that suffered most grievously from the mildew epidemic in 2018, today’s Pontet-Canet offering will be much discussed.
The Pauillac flying fifth has increasingly split opinion in recent vintages, its use of amphorae following a switch to biodynamics not quite to everyone’s taste nor its increasingly ambitious pricing strategy.
The critical reception this year is largely very positive. The scores from Antonio Galloni (96-99) and Lisa Perrotti-Brown MW (97-99) potentially make the 2018 the ‘best’ (at least the best-scored) since the 2010.
Calling the wine “one for true hedonists”, Perrotti-Brown praised its richness and “impossible” layers while Galloni called it “dark, rich and explosive”.
Other leading critics have also been very positive, even though Matthew Jukes admitted that while, “I appreciate that this is an extraordinary wine, I am not as excited about it as I am the aforementioned vintages [2010 and 2016],” yet still gave it an 18+ score.
Not everyone was quite so swept away, although she gave it a 16.5 score, Julia Harding MW thought it needed a lot more time to come into its own and UK merchant Corney & Barrow in its email to customers said its team had been “perplexed” by it.
On the price side, on balance most will have to concede the asking price is fair. As with fellow biodynamene Château Palmer, Pontet-Canet lost a huge proportion of its crop in 2018, first to mildew and then drought.
Yields were down to as little as 10 hectolitres per hectare so the fact it was produced at all is a near miracle. It’s for this reason that Galloni also called it a “freak of nature”.
Offered at £1,038 per dozen (an increase of 2.8% on the 2017), it’s cheaper than the 2016 and much less expensive than the 100-point 2009 and 2010.
Yes the 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015 and even 2017 wines are reasonably scored and often considerably cheaper, but if you’re following the critical scores then this is one of the better and certainly more unique iterations of the wine of the last decade and more.
As with Palmer, its limited allocations and the ‘rare curiosity’ factor should see what little is available sell through.
Two more wines with strong appeal have also been released: Domaine de Chevalier and Grand Puy Ducasse.
Dom. de Chevalier was one of yesterday afternoon’s late releases at £650 p/cs. It was a fairly hefty 25% rise on the 2017 offer but the critical scores and notes have painted it as “simply majestic” (Galloni) and the “greatest ever” (James Suckling).
Liv-ex’s algorithm would suggest it’s toppy though some of the general campaign whispers suggest it hasn’t gone entirely unappreciated.
Stronger though is Grand-Puy-Ducasse, out this morning (24 May) at £326 p/cs (up 4% on the 2017). Another brand ‘on the move’ and a bit of fan favourite the scores have been very good, potentially one of the best this estate has produced in the modern era.
Galloni thought it “one of the most polished and refined recent vintages” he could remember. On the right side of Liv-ex’s ‘fair’ value line, Wine Lister surmised that it was “the most interesting buy of the morning so far”.
Also out was Phélan Segur, an excellent wine by all accounts but perhaps looking a little toppy at £425 p/cs, which is roughly the same price as its 2005 and 2% above the current price of its 2016. As has happened with other estate’s in the past (Haut Batailley for example) Wine Lister suggested this might be part of a repositioning move by the new owners. The wine may be worth it but whether it will prove a big seller is perhaps more debateable.

According to specially-commissioned research by db, English fizz has emerged as the best-value wine option in London restaurants – and we consider why.

Such a result follows a study commissioned by db into the leading wine areas for value in London restaurants, which saw Sussex and England come out on top.
Using data compiled by wine list app, Wine Picker, the concept of ‘value’ was calculated by looking at the prices charged for English sparkling wines on wine lists, and comparing these to their scores from both consumer ratings sites (such as Snooth) and professional wine writers.
Having analysed data from over 500 wine lists in London, representing over 41,000 wines, West Sussex came out as the best-value wine region according to consumer ratings, and the second best (after Galicia) according to professionals (using scores from a range of leading commentators and websites/titles such as Jancis Robinson, Neil Martin, Decanter, Vinous, Wine Advocate and others).
Speaking about the result, Josselin Guibert, co-founder of Wine Picker, told db that he believed English sparkling benefitted from a quality focus, and keen pricing in restaurants.
“My opinion is that we are looking at a product which is made in small quantities, and high quality,” he said, explaining the high scores for the brands represented in London restaurants.
Continuing, he commented, “And I think it’s possible, that because the restaurants are in the UK, they are putting a lower margin on English sparkling,” suggesting that there is a greater urge to promote the product due to national pride.
As a result, one can find English sparkling wine on London restaurant lists at a lower price than Champagne, even when the former has higher ratings, and hence its value positioning.
When asked about English sparkling at Wiltons, a traditional upmarket English restaurant in St James’s, sommelier Harry Ballmann confirmed that he does deliberately price the fizz below Champagne.
“We have just revamped our wine list and we’ve done a big push on English sparkling, and gone from two wines to 15,” he began, before commenting, “Wiltons is an English institution, so we are playing on that by showing the best England has to offer.”
Continuing, he said that Wiltons “do bring down the GP (gross profit margin) on English sparkling, so a bottle would cost between £80-£120, but over £120, and our sparkling wine offer is grande marque Champagne.”
As for who is buying English fizz in a restaurant like Wiltons, Ballmann said that his longstanding customers tend to stick to Champagne, but tourists, particularly from the US, like to try English sparkling wine – if it’s suggested – and “love it”.
For Ballmann however, Champagne still offers better value in general terms. “The quality you get in Champagne is more consistent, and while there are pockets in English sparkling that are fantastic, you have to find them.”
London’s best-value wines by region (£15-500) according to consumers are:
1 West Sussex (UK) with an average rating of 92.3 and average price of £84.1
2 Navarra (Spain) with an average rating of 87.4 and average price of £34.8
3 Murica (Spain) with an average rating of 86.8 and average price of £28.9
4 Limarí (Chile) with an average rating of 87.2 and average price of £34.1
5 Patagonia (Argentina) with an average rating of 88.1 and average price of £45.3
London’s best-value wines by region (£15-500) according to professionals are:
1 Galicia (Spain) with an average rating of 89.4 and average price of £39.8
2 West Sussex (UK) with an average rating of 92.4 and average price of £78.7
3 Marlborough (New Zealand) with an average rating of 89.8 and average price of £46.8
4 England (UK) with an average rating of 90.4 and average price of £54.6
5 Victoria (Australia) with an average rating of 90.9 and average price of £63.4

The owner of Jameson, Irish Distillers, has launched a five-part podcast series telling the story of how three companies saved the country’s whiskey industry from extinction.
Entitled A Story of Irish Whiskey and produced by Last Cast Media, the podcast series depicts the transformation of the Irish whiskey industry from being “crippled by war, prohibition and bootleggers” the the renaissance the country is now experiencing.
Recounting the histories of the Jameson, Powers and Murphy families, the podcast uses a mix of interviews, archive recordings and dramatic recreations to chronicle the progress made in the 20th and 21st centuries.
The series will feature guest appearances from Kirsten, Tara and Andrea Jameson, Charles C. O’Reilly (descended from John Power) and master distiller emeritus at Irish Distillers, Barry Crockett.
Conor McQuaid, CEO and chairman of Irish Distillers said: “At our core, we believe that Irish Distillers exists to bring people together, be that through the growth of the Irish whiskey category, the experiences we create at our brand homes in Dublin and Midleton, or the simple enjoyment of our portfolio of whiskeys around the world.
“From the moment three whiskey families came together in 1966, we have been working hard to sustain and grow an industry that is inextricably linked to our Irish heritage. Everything that we do is driven by a desire to see the continued growth of Irish whiskey on the world stage, and today Irish whiskey has more fans and made more connections than at any other point since the 19th century. We believe that now is the time to tell the story of Irish whiskey to an ever-growing audience and further promote the reputation of one of Ireland’s most iconic exports.”
“The renaissance that Irish whiskey is now enjoying is not only a testament to all those working in whiskey now, but crucially to those that have gone before us and laid the foundations for growth. In our podcast ‘A Story of Irish Whiskey’, we tell their stories and honour their contribution to the moments that have shaped the course of history for the better. We are truly honoured to be able to tell the story of Irish whiskey through our podcast series.”

With the weekend heralding the start of this year’s English and Welsh Wine Week, we round up the best ways to immerse yourself in the UK’s buoyant wine scene.

Organised by industry body Wines of Great Britain (WineGB), this year’s English and Welsh Wine week runs from 25 May to 2 June.
Shining the spotlight on English and Welsh vineyards, the event coincides with the late May bank holiday, encouraging retailers, restaurateurs, hoteliers, winery owners and bar staff to promote homegrown wine throughout the long weekend.
Last year, the UK wine industry had a record year, with a total of 15.6 million bottles produced in England and Wales. This trumped the previous record (6.3 million bottles in 2014) by 9.3 million bottles.
Part of the increase can also be attributed to the ambitious vine planting programme. There are now more than 500 commercial vineyards in Great Britain. The area under vine in England and Wales has increased by 160% in the past 10 years to reach 2,888 hectares, with a further two million vines due to be planted this year.
In order to promote English and Welsh wine and to boost oenotourism, a number of regional groups such as The Wine Garden of England (Kent), Surrey Hills Vineyards, Vineyards of Hampshire and Sussex Wineries have been established in order promote county collaboration.
Commenting on this year’s event, Julia Trustram Eve, marketing manager of WineGB, said: “English Wine Week has become a popular and well-established campaign within the trade – it’s great to see what an effective promotional tool it is for retailers and the on-trade to highlight English wines to their customers.
“Year-on-year, the campaign uptake and reach have grown consistently, through outlets but also media coverage and a massive increase in social media reach and engagement. It is creating a real buzz!
“What really resonates is that sales of English wine not only spike during the week but sustain a good level of growth long after the week is over. This really is a campaign that gets results and we are so delighted to be working with such a broad scope of retailers, wholesalers, on-trade and of course highly supportive wine producers.”

In Big Beer, Carlsberg officially kicked off the celebrity component of its new “honest” marketing campaign in the UK with a TV ad starring Mads Mikkelsen.
The advert, which launches this month, will run through summer and “deliver the same honesty and humour as the campaign”, according to a statement from the brewer.

If you can’t be bothered to watch the video, in it, Mikkelsen confesses that “in the UK, Carlsberg pursued being the biggest, not the best and the beer suffered”.
After enjoying a pint of new Carlsberg Danish Pilsner, we discover Mikkelsen has gone full Bond-villain and had the guy “responsible” for the original recipe taken out.

Churchill’s has joined many of its fellow Port producers by declaring a 2017 vintage, the first back-to-back declaration for the company and the first in almost a century in the region.
The 2017 vintage is something of a rarity in the Douro as the 2016 vintage was also widely declared.
The two vintages are however very different beasts, the 2016 being quite a cool, rainy vintage and the 2017 being marked by exceptionally hot and dry weather.
Many have already remarked on the high concentration of the 2017 Ports, which was also the result of tiny yields due to the small size of the berries.
It was also a very early vintage, the earliest ever at Churchill’s although it was not the only one.
Johnny Graham, Churchill’s founder, said the 2017 vintage Port has a, “raw vibrancy…combining a purity of fruit with a vein of natural acidity, which will give this wine great ageing potential”.
A small quantity of Quinta da Gricha 2017 has also been bottled.

Heino Freudenberg, president and CEO of Vinventions – the world’s second largest wine closure supplier – has left the company after four years at the helm.
Heino Freudenberg has been president and CEO of Vinventions since its foundation in 2015
In a statement sent to the drinks business this morning, Freudenberg’s departure was confirmed by Vinventions, which is a business producing a range of stoppers using materials from glass to plastic as well as cork.
The company also said that Denis Van Roey, former CFO of Vinventions, has been appointed interim president of Vinventions, while noting that Freudenberg’s departure “has no impact on the structure of our shareholding”.
Explaining the reason why Freudenberg had left the company, Vinventions stated, “When Vinventions was founded in 2015, the vision was to create a company that would become the most innovative, most sustainable and most trusted global supplier of complete wine closure solutions to the still and sparkling wine industry.
“Heino Freudenberg completed this mission and his mandate of four years as president and CEO.
“We thank him for all he has done for Nomacorc and Vinventions as we look ahead to the next chapter of success for the company and execute that vision on a larger scale.”
Vinventions was created in 2015 by entrepreneur Marc Noël together with Bespoke Capital Partners, Heino Freudenberg and additional partners.
According to the company, Vinventions’ vision is to be a “global supplier of complete wine closure solutions to the still and sparkling wine industry”.
Since January 2015, Vinventions has acquired Nomacorc, Ohlinger Group and Syntek Bouchage and has created strategic partnerships with industry leaders such as Cork Supply (natural cork).
This led to the creation of ‘Vinventions’ Complete Wine Closure Solutions’, which encompasses Nomacorc (PlantCorcs), Syntek (synthetics), Ohlinger (natural corks), Vintop (screwcaps) and Vinolok (glass closures) as well as Wine Quality Solutions (oenological tools and services) and Wine Marketing Solutions (marketing services and wine consumer insights).
Today, Vinventions employs over 550 people globally and operates seven production sites in USA, Belgium, Germany, France, Argentina, South Africa and China.
According to Vinventions, it is the second largest wine closure supplier worldwide.

Colourful Scottish gin brand Boë’s sales have increased by more than £7 million thanks to a thirst for flavoured expressions and liqueurs, the company’s directors said.

Results filed with Companies House this month show Boë Gin’s revenues reached £8.5 million between March 2018 and February 2019, up from £1.1 million the previous year.
The company said this meant it ended the financial year with an increase of more than £1.1 million on operating profits compared to the previous 12 months.
Stiffy’s Shots Ltd, the original name of the business that filed Boë’s annual results on Companies House, announced a turnover of £9.9 million and £1.25 million in pre-tax profits.
Stiffy’s Shots now trades as VC2 brands, according to a member of staff at the company’s head offices in Stirling. It owns Boé Gin, as well as beer brand Black Wolf, and Stivy’s vodka liqueur.
It said that all of the growth in the last year filed under the company has come from Boë Gin.
Distillery director Carlo Valente said the rapid growth last year came as a result of the company focusing on producing liqueurs and flavoured gins that inject “vibrancy and colour” to an already crowded industry.
The company launched its first full strength, flavoured expression Boë Violet, at the tail-end of 2016. It initially gained listings in 276 Morrisons stores, adding a further 50 by October 2018. The Boë Gin range now totals six products; three gins comprising their classic Scottish Gin and two flavoured gins – Boë Passion and Boë Violet – plus three flavoured liqueurs; Peach and Hibiscus, Scottish Bramble and Spiced Orange.
“Knowing we were truly innovating and seeing the interest our products soar over the past year has led us to invest further in the business and hire more staff to support demand,” Valente said.
Sales of flavoured gin in the UK have contributed more than half of all the growth in the gin category in the past year, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA).
In September, the trade body reported that sales of UK gin have doubled in value in the past five years with exports and domestic sales totalling £2.2 billion in the year ending 16 June.
Almost three quarters of the growth in flavoured gin can be attributed to pink gin alone.
