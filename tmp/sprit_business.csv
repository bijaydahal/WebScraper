"Alexandre Ricard has left little room for ambiguity regarding recent speculation that Pernod Ricard faced pressure to consider merging with another big group, stressing his firm will “remain a consolidator” in the industry.",12 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2017/09/Alexandre-Ricard-1.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/pernod-ceo-shoots-down-merger-talk/,"Alexandre Ricard has left little room for ambiguity regarding recent speculation that Pernod Ricard faced pressure to consider merging with another big group, stressing his firm will “remain a consolidator” in the industry.

After Elliott Management Corporation announced it had built a stake of more than 2.5% in Pernod at the end of last year, reports claimed the New York-based hedge fund had recommended that the Absolut maker should explore the option of a merger.

However, at a media briefing in London this morning (12 February), group chairman and CEO Alexandre Ricard called the news “pure market speculation” and reaffirmed Pernod’s position as an industry “consolidator”.

He said: “[We] have been a consolidator in the industry and I hope that it will be no surprise as I reiterate very clearly and specifically: Pernod Ricard is here, Pernod Ricard is here to stay, and Pernod Ricard is and will remain a consolidator.”

Pernod Ricard was formed in 1975 with the merger of pastis makers Pernod and Ricard. Since then the business has grown to become the world’s second largest spirits firm with a market cap of €40 billion, aided through transformative acquisitions including Absolut vodka, Irish Distillers and Allied Domecq.

Elliott, run by Wall Street billionaire Paul Singer, has called for improvements to Pernod’s margins and governance, which it claimed needed more outside influence. The founding family of Pernod Ricard remains its largest shareholder with a 14.2% stake and the biggest board room presence.

Hedge fund Elliott has a reputation for aggressive lobbying of company boards, but Ricard described ongoing talks as “cordial and constructive”.

“We have always said we are open to dialogue with our shareholders generally speaking, and Elliott being one of our shareholders, we continue to be open to dialogue with them,” he said.

“The fact that we can improve operating margin is not a secret – actually it’s at the core of our three-year strategic plan, which we designed alongside our teams a year ago. We are in the first year of that plan and [are] already seeing operating margin pull through.

“The fact that governance can be improved is an endless process. Governance will endlessly evolve today as it has over the last few years, and you should expect to see this continue.”

At the same time as announcing its latest H1 results last week, Pernod revealed its ‘Transform & Accelerate’ plan, a three-year programme that aims to improve operational leverage. Soon after, Elliott issued a statement claiming the strategy set “modest goals” and lacked “specificity and clarity”.

In January, Pernod named former Christie’s CEO Patricia Barbizet as its lead independent director, at the same time as the group’s ex-CEO Pierre Pringuet took a step back.

Ricard said his firm approaches corporate governance with a view of “endless improvement” and “constant evolution” since “static organisations tend to die”.

He continued: “Having outside information and perspective on yourself is always interesting and is always enriching. It doesn’t mean you have to be okay with everything, it doesn’t mean you have to agree with everything.

“But I do like debate and I like to listen: it is always an enrichment.”",Pernod CEO shoots down merger talk
"Retaliatory tariffs curtailed American whiskey exports in 2018, according to the Distilled Spirits Council, which has called for a swift resolution to the “harmful” taxes.",13 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/02/Big-story-American-flag-US-goverment-shutdown.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/harmful-tariffs-curtail-american-whiskey-exports/,"Retaliatory tariffs curtailed American whiskey exports in 2018, according to the Distilled Spirits Council, which has called for a swift resolution to the “harmful” taxes.

Trade body the Distilled Spirits Council said during its annual economic briefing that retaliatory tariffs, sparked by US president Donald Trump’s 10% and 25% tariffs on aluminium and steel respectively, have had a “negative impact” on American whiskey exports – particularly to the EU.

American whiskey exports to the EU were buoyant during the first half of 2018, growing at 33%. However, exports dropped by 8.7% after retaliatory tariffs were put in place, compared to the same July-November period in 2017.

Globally, during the first six months of 2018, American whiskey exports were growing at 28% (US$595 million). Following the introduction of retaliatory tariffs, value exports declined by 8.2% to US$526m between July and November, compared to the same period in 2017.

Chris Swonger, Distilled Spirits Council president and CEO, said: “We strongly encourage the administration and our trading partners in the EU, Canada and Mexico to quickly resolve these harmful tariffs that are undercutting economic growth in this sector and adversely affecting American workers.”

Overall, spirits sales in the US delivered record results for the ninth consecutive year in 2018. Supplier sales grew by US$1.3 billion (5.1%) to reach US$27.5bn last year, while volume rose 2.2% to 231m cases – a 5m increase on the previous year.

“These robust results show adult consumers are continuing to favour spirits over beer and wine, particularly among millennials,” said Swonger.

“The spirits sector is benefiting from millennials who demand diverse and authentic experiences, and desire innovative and higher-end products.”

Looking across the majority of spirit categories, the strongest growth came from the high-end premium and super-premium products, with revenue for these price points up 8.9% and 10.5% respectively. Volume was up 8% and 7.5% respectively.

American whiskey was noted to be a “key driver”, up 6.6% to US$3.6bn; Tequila rose 10.2% to US$3bn; Cognac grew 14.2% to US$1.8bn; and Irish whiskey increased 12% to US$1bn.

Single malt Scotch also returned to growth, increasing 9.4% to US$843m. Super-premium gin grew 15.6%, and super-premium rum rose 28.5%.

Vodka, which accounts for a third of all volume, saw volume sales rise by 1.6%, while value grew 2.9% to US$6.4bn.

David Ozgo, Distilled Spirits Council chief economist, said: “Growth was concentrated in the higher priced categories, allowing the industry to enjoy significant revenue growth while also picking up drinking occasions from other beverages.

“The continued excitement surrounding super-premium American whiskeys is creating a halo effect for the entire whiskey category.”",‘Harmful’ tariffs curtail American whiskey exports
Industry watchdog the Portman Group has upheld a complaint against Three Pugs Bubblegum Gin Liqueur that argued the product would appeal to children due to its cartoon label.,8 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/02/Three-Pugs-Gin-Liqueur-280x280.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/three-pugs-gin-liqueur-rapped-for-appealing-to-children/,"Industry watchdog the Portman Group has upheld a complaint against Three Pugs Bubblegum Gin Liqueur that argued the product would appeal to children due to its cartoon label.

The Portman Group’s independent complaints panel upheld the complaint under code rule 3.2(h), which states a drink, its packaging and any promotional material should not in any direct or indirect way have a particular appeal to under-18s.

A member of the public believed that “the pink liquid and label with the cartoon pictures of the pugs on is too appealing to children”.

The Portman Group took action in lieu of the member of the public. The complaints panel took the overall packaging into account and concluded the use of “pugalicious” as a description of the bubblegum flavour on the label, along with the fact the product was pink, were not problematic on their own.

However, combined with the cartoon pug illustration, which depicted the dogs in a hot air balloon overlooking a “Willy Wonka-like sweet land” across a pink liquid, the panel said the gin liqueur “was likely to have a particular appeal to under-18s”.

A spokesperson for the Portman Group said: “This decision once again highlights that producers should steer clear of references and imagery related to childhood and childhood memories.

“They should think carefully about what is conveyed by the overall impression of the product and speak to our advisory service if in any doubt.”

During the complaints process, Silverback Distillers, which makes Three Pugs Gin, explained to the panel that it had sought advice from the Wine and Spirits Trade Association (WSTA), Trading Standards and Business Growth Hub, and consulted various distributors and specialist retail outlets when designing the label.

The company highlighted it had ensured the words ‘gin liqueur’ were displayed prominently on the front of the bottle to stress it was aimed at adults.

Silverback Distillers also argued that the picture of the pugs on the front of the bottle was not a cartoon, but a caricature of the owner’s three pet pugs and “represented their true likeness without any embellishment to ensure that they did not appeal to under-18s”.

Furthermore, the bubblegum bubbles on the front of the bottle were “relevant to the flavour” of the liquid, which was also stated on the front of the label as required by EU law.

It also said the product was priced “relatively high” and therefore unaffordable to under-18s. The company also said it was currently “not willing” to commit to any labelling changes due to the uncertainty of Brexit, which could result in changes to labelling laws next year.

Following the ruling, Three Pugs Gin has agreed to edit its label by 1 June 2019, and has said it is “fully supportive” of the Portman Group’s code.

Christine Ditchfield, director of Three Pugs Gin, said: “We had taken advice from many independent organisations prior to printing this label and had spent a considerable amount of time and resource and money to obtain certification to ensure we met EU regulations with regard to our label.

“When we received the complaint from the Portman Group we had in-depth conversations with them. Based on the independent panel’s decision, we are working to make relevant changes to the label for this product and have agreed with the Portman Group that this will be achieved no later than 1st June 2019.

“With this in mind, we would like to state that we are fully supportive of the Portman Group guidelines to ensure alcoholic products do not appeal to under-18s.

“We are passionate about what we do and feel that the industry as a whole, particularly craft distillers, need to be made aware sooner rather than later of the existence of the Portman Group and guidelines.”

Research published by two leading British and German universities has debunked the myth “beer before wine and you’ll feel fine; wine before beer and you’ll feel queer”.,8 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2018/10/Cocktail-Drinking.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/order-in-which-alcohol-is-consumed-has-no-effect-on-hangovers/,"Research published by two leading British and German universities has debunked the myth “beer before wine and you’ll feel fine; wine before beer and you’ll feel queer”.

The research, carried out by the University of Cambridge and Witten/Herdecke University in Germany, aimed to discover how the order in which alcoholic drinks are consumed can affect the next morning’s hangover.

To test this, 90 volunteers aged between 19- and 40-years-old were recruited and split into three groups. The first group consumed two and a half pints of beer followed by four large glasses of wine. The second group consumed the same amount of alcohol, but in reverse order. Subjects in the third control group consumed either only beer or only wine.

A week later, participants in the first and second study groups were switched to the opposite drinking order. Control group subjects who drank only beer the first time around received only wine on the second study day, and vice versa.

After each day of drinking, participants were asked about their hangover and gave a score for how they felt from 0-56, based on factors including thirst, fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, stomach ache, increased heart rate and loss of appetite.

The research, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that none of the three groups had a significantly different hangover score with different orders of alcoholic drinks. It also found that women tended to have slightly worse hangovers than men.

“Using white wine and lager beer, we didn’t find any truth in the idea that drinking beer before wine gives you a milder hangover than the other way around,” said first author Jöran Köchling from Witten/Herdecke University.

Hangover symptoms occur when higher-than-normal blood alcohol concentrations drop back to zero. Hangovers are likely to be influenced by ingredients other than pure alcohol, such as colourings and flavourings, it is therefore suggested that dark spirits such as rum and Bourbon may cause a more severe hangover than vodka.

Dr Kai Hensel, a senior clinical fellow at the University of Cambridge and senior author of the study, said: “Unpleasant as hangovers are, we should remember that they do have one important benefit, at least: they are a protective warning sign that will certainly have aided humans over the ages to change their future behaviour. In other words, they can help us learn from our mistakes.”",Order in which alcohol is consumed has no effect on hangovers
"Staggering statistics and shocking stories have depicted the disturbing frequency of harassment in the hospitality industry. While movements and initiatives have started to bring the issue to the fore, there is still more to be done to combat abuse.",8 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2018/04/vodka-people.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/sb-voices-the-dark-side-of-hospitality/,"Staggering statistics and shocking stories have depicted the disturbing frequency of harassment in the hospitality industry. While movements and initiatives have started to bring the issue to the fore, there is still more to be done to combat abuse.

If you work in the hospitality industry you may be no stranger to stories of being overworked, unfair pay, drug use, bullying, violence and sexual harassment in bars, pubs and restaurants.

The prevalence of sexual harassment in our culture today is shocking. There have been plenty of studies in the last couple of years that have shown the unrivalled amount of harassment in the on-trade. Preliminary findings of the Not on the Menu survey by Unite in January 2018 showed that nine out 10 hospitality staff have experienced sexual harassment at work.

Of those who reported that they were sexually harassed at work, more than half said the perpetrators were members of the public and another 22% said they were harassed at the hands of a manager.

In the workplace, harassment can happen between two employees, but also between a customer and employee.

As the face of the venue, bartenders and front-of-house staff are depended upon to provide a welcoming and friendly service, which can all too easily be misconstrued by patrons, who then exhibit unwanted attention and inappropriate behaviour.

Just yesterday, I wrote about a new initiative from journalist Victoria Stewart and public relations officer Hannah Norris that seeks to address “toxic behaviour” in the hospitality industry, called Hospitality Speaks.

Launching at the end of March, the non-for-profit platform will create a “safe online space” for hospitality workers to share their stories of bullying, harassment and discrimination, anonymously.

The aim is to improve working conditions in the hospitality industry by engaging with employers and workers to identify abusive behaviours and practices, champion employers who are pioneers in staff welfare, and establish an industry standard for behaviour and ethics.

Around the world, game-changing movements including Time’s Up and #MeToo have helped to instigate a wave of reaction throughout numerous industries, including hospitality.

The #NotTheJob campaign was launched in October 2018 by Birmingham Yardley MP Jess Philips, calling for “zero tolerance of sexual harassment” in the workplace. Philips asked followers on social media to share their experiences of harassment while working as service staff across all industries, but it was those working in pubs and bars who were the most vocal.

The UK government also recently announced a package of commitments to tackle sexual harassment in the workplace, which will include the introduction of a statutory code of practice on sexual harassment.

Another prominent example in the UK is the Ask for Angela campaign, which aims to prevent violence and anti-social behaviour and to empower victims to make a decision on whether to report incidents. The campaign encourages visitors in bars, restaurants and cafes to ask for ‘Angela’, a code word to notify staff that they are in an uncomfortable situation and need to safely leave the premises.

Meanwhile, education and training have also been critical to addressing and preventing threatening situations. Washington DC-based firm Safe Bars, which launched in 2016, holds two-hour bystander-intervention training for bar staff with the goal of creating a safer and more welcoming nightlife culture.

Last year also saw annual New Orleans festival Tales of the Cocktail take a stand for sexual abuse and partner with Sexual Trauma Awareness and Response (STAR), a Louisiana non-profit organisation that provides support and education for those affected by sexual trauma. The festival also provided a 24-­hour hotline to report sexual violence and held a seminar on the issue.

Undoubtedly there is a great amount of work left for the bar industry to do in order to stamp out harassment. But it’s taking these small steps towards open discussion that can lead to a safer and more positive working environment. We need more education, open dialogues and a strict code of conduct in the industry if we’re going to make a change for the better.",SB Voices: The dark side of hospitality
"Activist investor Elliott Management has maintained its tough stance with Pernod Ricard, stating the group’s financial objectives “could be more ambitious”.",8 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2018/10/Pernod-Ricard.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/investor-accuses-pernod-ricard-of-setting-modest-goals/,"Activist investor Elliott Management has maintained its tough stance with Pernod Ricard, stating the group’s financial objectives “could be more ambitious”.

Elliott revealed it had built a stake of more than 2.5% in the French drinks giant at the end of last year, and called for better governance and margins.

Yesterday (7 February) Pernod announced that it had increased its organic profit forecast for FY19 to between +6% and +8% following a 7.8% organic sales growth in H1 to €5.18 billion (US$5.87bn) and an organic profit gain of 12.8% to €1.7bn (US$1.9bn).

The firm also said the first semester of its new ‘Transform & Accelerate’ plan, a three-year programme that aims to improve operational leverage, had been “very strong”. Under the plan, Pernod is working to save €100m (US$113m) by the end of its 2021 fiscal year.

Elliott said Pernod’s H1 results “confirmed the strong growth potential and solid financial performance” of the company, and showed it had taken a “first small step” to address its “shortcomings in operational efficiency”.

However, Elliott called for greater ambition in the group’s strategy, which it claimed set “modest goals” and lacked “specificity and clarity”.

The American hedge fund also said “necessary enhancements” to Pernod’s board of directors “have yet to be addressed”. Elliott had previously accused Pernod of “inadequate” corporate governance due to a “lack of outside perspectives”.

At the end of last month, Pernod named former Christie’s CEO Patricia Barbizet as its lead independent director, as the same time as the firm’s former CEO, Pierre Pringuet, stepped down from his role as vice-chairman of the board of directors.

Elliott’s statement continued: “Elliott trusts that Pernod’s management will continue to engage in a mutually constructive dialogue to deliver much needed additional improvements while capturing the strong growth of the company’s underlying markets.”

While Pernod is establishing change, CEO Alexandre Ricard previously insisted the group’s strategy for growth “is the right one”.

In response to Elliott’s latest criticism, Pernod Ricard said in a statement: “Our results announced yesterday prove once again the effectiveness of our strategy and its ability to deliver sustainable and profitable growth for all our stakeholders. We remain focused on executing our three-year Transform & Accelerate strategic plan.

“We continue our regular dialogue with our shareholders and have no other comments to make at this stage.”

In the IWSR Global Opportunities in Low- and No-Alcohol report, the Dry January movement is described as “the start of a wider health and wellness trend that is gaining traction across the world, providing new opportunities for the global beverage alcohol industry”.

The study assessed market sizing by volume, key players in the industry, the on-trade, product innovation and consumer trends.

“The Dry January movement isn’t new, but one of the reasons we’ve heard so much more about it this year is the broader trend that points to consumers’ increased interest in physical and mental health,” said Mark Meek, IWSR CEO.

“And that’s creating an interesting shift in consumer preference for low- and no-alcohol beverages, outside of soft drinks.

“For leading producers of beverage alcohol, this obviously presents considerable opportunity to develop new products, claim their share of the category and ultimately grow revenue.”

While the category is predicted to “grow significantly”, the IWSR claims the current marketplace “is still small in most parts of the world”.

In the UK, low- and no-alcohol brands represent 1.3% of the country’s total alcohol market, while in the US the category represents only 0.5%.

In the on-trade, most venues surveyed offered non-alcoholic beer, but zero-alcohol wine “was notably absent”.

The off-trade offers “significantly more” low- and no-alcohol products than bars and restaurants.

Looking at the US market, 52% of consumers surveyed said they were trying to reduce their alcohol intake, while more than 70% said they had not considered drinking low- or no-alcohol offerings.

Ready-to-drink (RTD) products are expected to lead the low- and no-alcohol sector in the US, forecast to increase by 38% CAGR between 2018 to 2022. Wine will follow at 17.7%, then spirits at 7.1%, with beer predicted to grow by 5.6%.

In the UK, spirits are expected to lead the growth of the low- and no-booze sector (81.1%), followed by RTDs (44.3%), cider (13%), wine (6.6%) and beer (4.9%).

According to the IWSR, 65% of the UK’s heaviest drinkers (25- to 34-year-olds) are trying, or have tried, to cut back on their alcohol intake.

The IWSR also noted that Spain is one of Europe’s largest and most well established markets for low- and no-alcohol, led by beer and mixed drinks. The country’s low- and no-alcohol sector is expected to grow by 36.8% CAGR between 2018 and 2022, with wine growing by 19.8% and beer by 6.7%.

In Australia, non-alcoholic beer represents the largest share of the low- and no-alcohol market in Australia but is expected to decline by 0.1% (CAGR 2018-2022). The low- and no-alcohol ‘spirits’ category is predicted to grow 28.6%.

The German market for low- and no-booze is showing growth with 60% of drinkers stating they have, or would consider consuming products in the category.

The sector is forecast to be led by spirits, which are expected to grow by 14.4% in Germany by 2022. This is followed by RTDs (13.3%), cider (11.4%), wine (4%) and beer (1.6%).

A number of leading drinks producers have launched low-alcohol versions of their existing brands, while others have joined the alcohol-free ‘spirits’ category.

A court has ruled that a German whisky has breached the geographical indication (GI) of Scotch whisky by using the word ‘Glen’ in its name.,8 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2018/12/Scotch-whisky-WSR.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/german-whiskys-use-of-glen-deemed-misleading/,"A court has ruled that a German whisky has breached the geographical indication (GI) of Scotch whisky by using the word ‘Glen’ in its name.

German single malt whisky brand Glen Buchenbach is made by a distillery in Berglen and states it is a German product on its label.

However, the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) argued the product could confuse consumers and “mislead them as to the true origin of the whisky” due to the Scottish connotation of the word ‘Glen’.

In June 2018, the SWA took legal action against Glen Buchenbach through Hamburg’s regional court, which asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to “interpret” the GI.

While the ECJ did not rule on the case, it did offer guidance to assess whether the German distiller had breached EU laws on protected GI statuses.

The ECJ stated that for the GI to have been breached, the word ‘Glen’ must conjure more than associations with Scotland – it must make consumers think of Scotch whisky specifically.

Furthermore, the ECJ ruled that Germany’s national court should decide “whether an average European consumer thinks directly of the protected geographical indication ‘Scotch whisky’ when he is confronted with a comparable product bearing the designation ‘Glen’”.

The decision was made this week by the Hamburg court that the use of the word ‘Glen’ on a German whisky could be misleading for consumers.

Alan Park, SWA director of legal affairs, said: “The SWA has consistently taken action in our global markets to prevent the use of Scottish indications of origin on whisky which is not Scotch whisky.

“This is vital to protecting Scotland’s national drink and is a deterrent to those who seek to take advantage of the quality reputation of Scotch whisky and potentially mislead consumers.

“Courts across many jurisdictions have ruled that names, such as ‘Highland’ and ‘Glen’, and images, such as bagpipers, are so strongly associated with Scotland and Scotch whisky that their use on whisky of another origin is misleading.

“Our case against Glen Buchenbach presented clear and compelling evidence to the court that ‘Glen’ is strongly associated with Scotland and Scotch whisky, and the only reason to use ‘Glen’ for a German whisky is because of its undoubted association with Scotch whisky.

“We are pleased with the court’s decision that the use of Glen on a German whisky is misleading.”",German whisky’s use of ‘Glen’ deemed ‘misleading’
"More than 100,000 bottles of rare single malt Scotch were sold in UK auctions last year – a record high that demonstrates growing interest in whisky investments.",8 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2017/07/Bowmore-1957-54-year-old.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/record-sales-for-scotch-at-uk-auctions-in-2018/,"More than 100,000 bottles of rare single malt Scotch were sold in UK auctions last year – a record high that demonstrates growing interest in whisky investments.

According to figures released by consultancy and brokerage Rare Whisky 101 (RW101), the volume and value of rare Scotch sold through UK auction houses reached record figures.

In total, 107,890 bottles of single malt Scotch were sold at auction in the UK in 2018, a 29% increase on 2017. The value of bottles sold rose by 63% to £40.7 million (US$52.7m).

The average bottle price rose 26% to a record £377.91 (US$490), while the number of bottles that fetched £10,000 (US$13,000) or more increased by a massive 191% to 265.

In November last year, the only bottle of 1926 Macallan featuring a hand-painted design by Irish artist Michael Dillon became the world’s most expensive whisky after fetching £1.2m at Christie’s in London. It is the only standard-sized bottle of whisky to sell for more than £1m (US$1.3m) to date.

RW101’s index for rare whisky, called the Apex Index, which tracks the best performing 1,000 bottles of rare whisky, was up 30% by the end of 2018, outperforming commodities such as fine wine and gold.

Bowmore became the number one distillery in RW101’s ranking of the most investible whiskies, knocking Macallan off the top spot.

According to David Robertson, co-founder of RW101, demand for rare whiskies will remain strong, but Brexit may hamper access to bottles.

“While demand for rare and vintage whisky shows no signs of slowing, the fundamentals of investing in the rare whisky market remains strong,” he said.

“The UK auction market remains the biggest and most active market worldwide, and there’s nothing to suggest that will change. As consumption continues to increase, driven by connoisseurs, collectors and investors, the stocks of rare whisky will continue to diminish, creating the ideal conditions for escalating hammer prices.

“However, with the uncertainty of Brexit hanging over us, it is extremely difficult to second guess what will happen with cross border trade and access to bottles. From both a volume and value perspective, 2019 is very difficult to predict.”",Record sales for Scotch at UK auctions in 2018

The latest episode in the series features the final on-camera interview with Dave Pickerell, the celebrated late master distiller of WhistlePig who died suddenly on 1 November 2018 at the age of 62, just a month after the film was shot.

In the episode, Pickerell discusses his legacy, how he deals with critics and what they do with pigs at the WhistlePig farm. The 20-minute interview is streaming exclusively on Amazon Prime in the US and UK.

Minnick said: “Dave Pickerell was an incredible distiller. He consulted on more than 100 whiskey distilleries and served as master distiller for Maker’s Mark, Hillrock and WhistlePig. I cannot believe he’s gone, but I hope this interview gives us one more memory of the talented man.”

"The number of distilleries in Kentucky has more than tripled in 10 years, with Bourbon production contributing US$8.6 billion to the state’s economy annually, according to a recent report.",11 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2018/12/Scotch-whisky-WSR.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/kentucky-distillery-numbers-triple-in-a-decade/,"The number of distilleries in Kentucky has more than tripled in 10 years, with Bourbon production contributing US$8.6 billion to the state’s economy annually, according to a recent report.

The Economic and Fiscal Impacts of the Distilling Industry in Kentucky report was prepared by Dr Paul Coomes and Barry Kornstein, formerly of the University of Louisville, in conjunction with the Kentucky Distillers’ Association (KDA).

The biennial report notes that there are now 68 distilleries in the state – a 258% increase since 2009. The number of counties with a distillery has also quadrupled to 32, up from only eight in 2009.

The study shows that the Kentucky Bourbon industry has generated more than 20,100 jobs with an annual payroll topping US$1bn, provided US$235 million in local and state tax revenue, and is in the middle of a US$2.3bn building boom.

The report noted that if the industry continues to grow at this rate, economic output would surpass US$10bn by 2020, with employment at more than 24,000 and payroll reaching more than US$1.2bn.

There are now nearly two barrels of spirit for every person in the state – valued at US$3bn, three times more than a decade ago.

Kentucky exported more than US$450m worth of Bourbon and other spirits in 2017; the export value has tripled in the last 20 years.

However, the new figures were reported before several countries enacted retaliatory tariffs on Bourbon.

Eric Gregory, president of the KDA, applauded state and legislative leaders for their efforts to “modernise archaic alcohol laws, reform out-dated tourism restrictions and tackle the discriminatory tax that only Kentucky levies on ageing whiskey barrels”.

More work to be done

Despite the successful figures, Gregory said there is still more work to be done.

Kentucky state representative Matthew Koch filed the House Bill 200 last week, which would allow Kentucky distilleries to sell exclusive bottlings in gift shops – a benefit that other distilleries, wineries and breweries already have.

Koch said the bill will “increase visitors” to the Kentucky Bourbon Trail tour.

Gregory also claimed that the industry’s non-refundable Bourbon Barrel Reinvestment Credit passed in 2014 needed to be updated.

“Distillers can’t realise the full benefit of the barrel credit, which means less money they can reinvest for future growth,” Gregory said. “We should not have a tax structure that penalises increased production and investment. The barrel credit needs to be refundable or transferrable.”

He also added that the industry must “continue to work with state commissioner of agriculture Ryan Quarles to increase usage of Kentucky corn”.

The study showed that more than half of all distillers’ grain purchases are made from Kentucky farm families.",Kentucky distillery numbers triple in a decade

Early bird tickets are now on sale for the one-day event, which will take place on Friday 7 June at RSA House. Ginposium features representatives from the spirits industry sharing their knowledge on topics surrounding gin.

Topics on the agenda include a gin view from Australia and a presentation by Diageo’s master distiller Terry Fraser, which will mark the 250th anniversary of Gordon’s Gin.

Talks include a discussion on the developments of the botanical trade, a guide to distillery start-ups and a seminar on how design can affect your gin.

This year’s panel discussion, chaired by Ed Pilkington, grand rectifier of The Gin Guild, will look to the future of the category with debates on topics such as whether gin has peaked, the acceptability of products described as gin liqueurs and the issue of pushing the flavour envelope.

Twelve speakers have already confirmed their attendance, including Tommy Haughton, Beacon Commodities; Nolan Kane, Allied Glass; Ben Marston, Puddingstone Distillery; Dr Anne Brock, Bombay Sapphire Distillery; Evelyne Canterranne, FlavorActiv; David T Smith, from Summerfruit Cup; Ciara Cullen, partner at Reynolds Porter Chamberlain; Tom Warner, Warner Edwards; Joanne McKerchar, Diageo; Alistair Taylor, compliance manager, Portman Group; and Stuart Gregor, Four Pillars Distillery.

Nicholas Cook, director general of The Gin Guild, said: “The excitement, innovation and interest in gin continues.

“Due to the Ginposium’s growing popularity, we moved to a bigger venue two years ago and still sold out. Ginposium is a great networking opportunity for new brands and new distilleries, and it inspires debate on pressing industry topics among the established brands.”

For the period ending 31 December 2018, net sales dropped to US$22.5 million compared to US$24.1m for the same period the previous year.

The drop in sales was also attributed to a one-time US$1m increase in professional fees.

Richard J Lampen, president and chief executive officer of Castle Brands, said: “Our third quarter, and as a result our nine months, were adversely affected by two atypical factors.

“First, while the overall case sales of Jefferson’s rose 20.7% in the nine months, the case mix in the third quarter was skewed toward our lower price and lower margin expression, Jefferson’s Small Batch.

“In contrast, our prior-year third quarter included US$2.5 million in sales of our limited release, high-margin Jefferson’s Presidential Select. We expect this situation to reverse in the fourth quarter as several Jefferson’s expressions with significantly higher prices and margins, such as Jefferson’s Pichon Baron and Jefferson’s Ocean Cask Strength, become available.

“Second, our third quarter results were also negatively impacted by a one-time US$1 million increase in professional fees.

“Setting aside the case mix in the third quarter, we expect the strong growth in Jefferson’s to continue to drive our long-term trends of increasing sales and improving financial performance.”

Shareholder Western Gate has called for the removal of Stock Spirits’ chairman and senior independent director over concerns regarding “significant shareholder value destruction”.,28 January 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/01/David-mahoney.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/01/stock-spirits-shareholder-calls-for-chairmans-removal/,"Shareholder Western Gate has called for the removal of Stock Spirits’ chairman and senior independent director over concerns regarding “significant shareholder value destruction”.

Western Gate – which owns a 10% stake in Stock Spirits, making it the company’s biggest shareholder – has said it will vote against the re-election of chairman David Maloney and senior independent director John Nicolson at the upcoming AGM (annual general meeting).

The investor argued that the board needs a “new culture” as a result of “poor financial performance” and “lost market share” since Stock Spirits launched its IPO.

Western Gate has outlined its main concerns, which include Stock Spirits’ “failure” to articulate and execute a credible growth strategy with limited M&A (mergers and acquisitions); a low cash return to shareholders among its peers; a continued underperforming share price down 18%, and a “pitiful” TSR (total shareholder return) down 16% from the start of January 2018 to date; plus a “slow and inadequate” recovery of market share in Poland, and declining market share in Italy and the Czech Republic.

Western Gate has spoken out before when Stock Spirits published a “satisfactory” start to its 2017 trading year. The company said there was “no evidence” of a turnaround at Stock Spirits and claimed shareholders had not been fully briefed about the strategy to deliver growth.

A spokesperson for Western Gate said: “Stock Spirits needs to be run for the company, its owners, not its managers. The board, led by the chairman, David Maloney, continues to treat corporate governance as a box-ticking exercise whilst ignoring shareholders and overseeing a culture of group think.

“In short, a vote against David Maloney and John Nicolson is a vote for higher cash returns and a more shareholder-friendly board focused on delivering a credible growth strategy.

“Indeed, a large protest vote against these directors should be taken as a mandate from shareholders for much needed change.”

Stock Spirits responded to Western Gate’s comments this morning, and said Maloney and Nicolson have the “unanimous support” of their fellow board members.

In December last year, Stock Spirits reported a revenue increase of 8.7% to €282.4 million (US$320.1m) for 2018, bolstered by “solid” growth in Poland.

The spirits and liqueurs producer reported pro-forma 12-month results to account for a move in its financial year to end in September.

The results showed revenue in Poland was up 55% to €152.6m (US$173m), while revenue in the Czech Republic grew 25% to €73.2m (US$83m).

A statement released by Stock Spirits said: “Both David Maloney and John Nicolson continue to have the unanimous support of their colleagues on the board, and have been instrumental in helping to restore stability to Stock Spirits.

“We have made it clear that M&A is an integral part of our growth strategy and we continue to assess a range of opportunities in order to enhance shareholder value.

“The proposed final dividend represents a continuation of our progressive dividend policy, while also allowing us to retain a strong balance sheet in order to carry out M&A activity.

“More broadly, we believe that our recent financial results in December clearly demonstrate that the refreshed strategy is working. In our core marketplace of Poland we have now delivered 20 consecutive months of profitable year on year market share growth.”

Ian Macleod Distillers’ multi-million-pound redevelopment plans for Scotch whisky distillery Rosebank have been approved by the local council.,29 January 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/01/Rosebank-Distillery.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/01/rosebank-distillery-restoration-plans-approved/,"Ian Macleod Distillers’ multi-million-pound redevelopment plans for Scotch whisky distillery Rosebank have been approved by the local council.

The company submitted a planning application in June 2018 and following a public consultation process, Falkirk Council has agreed to the restoration of the famous Lowland distillery.

Ian Macleod Distillers first revealed plans to revive Rosebank in 2017, and secured £80m worth of funding for the project in November the same year.

Leonard Russell, managing director of Ian Macleod Distillers, said: “To bring back to life an iconic distillery and quintessential Lowland single malt is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity.

“Our investment goes beyond production. We’re proud to be investing in Falkirk by adding to the town’s flourishing economy and tourism scene with a new Rosebank visitor centre, to help tell the story of this remarkable whisky.

“Rosebank distillery has a very special place in Scotland’s whisky heritage and we’re committed to ensuring this remains the case.

“We will strive to replicate the unique Rosebank style by once more employing the unique techniques of triple distillation and worm tub condensers, for which this iconic Lowland single malt is famed.”

Rosebank fell silent in 1993 when previous owner United Distillers & Vintners (UDV, now called Diageo) closed the site and converted its maltings into a restaurant.

Bringing the distillery back into operation will create 25 full-time jobs when it begins operating. It is expected to open to visitors in autumn 2020.

Located on the banks of the Forth & Clyde Canal in Scotland, plans for Rosebank include a 1,000-square-metre “contemporary and energy efficient” distillery, capable of producing up to one million litres of alcohol per year.

The Rosebank chimney will remain in place, and other “historically significant” canal buildings will be revamped as a visitor centre, tasting room, shop and warehouses.

Now Falkirk Council has approved the plans, Ian Macleod Distillers can progress with purchasing the Rosebank site from current owners Scottish Canals.

Ian Macleod Distillers purchased the Rosebank brand and remaining inventory from Diageo in October 2017. The stock will be released in small quantities from this year.",Rosebank distillery restoration plans approved

The Mars Agency’s Smart Aisle platform has been created to assist shoppers with product selection, and offer information and educational tools at the point of purchase. The platform combines a voice-activated interface, artificial intelligence and LED shelf lights.

Smart Aisle will ask shoppers questions about their whisky preferences and then filter the assortment down to three recommended bottles, reading out names and descriptions. Shelf lights highlight the locations of the recommended bottles.

Shoppers can also ask the platform about a specific whisky or brand and receive a recommendation with a similar taste profile.

“We’re excited to partner with the Mars Agency and test the Smart Aisle platform in our stores,” says Tamara Pattison, chief marketing and information officer at BevMo!.

“This simply enhances our commitment to using technology to offer better customer experiences and this kind of forward-thinking, in-store solution is totally in line with our strategy.”

The platform will be tested at BevMo! stores in California in Oakland, San Jose, Santa Clara, Mira Mesa and Carmel Mountain until the end of March.

The latest test for the platform follows a trial in New York for a similar Smart Aisle whisky selector. The two-month pilot resulted in a 20% year-on-year sales lift for the featured bottles and positive feedback from shoppers.

Ken Barnett, global CEO at the Mars Agency, said: “We believe Smart Aisle has the potential to transform the way people shop for products across a wide range of categories. We’re in discussions with several brands and retailers to turn that vision into reality.”",Voice-activated whisky assistant trials in US

"Bacardi is planning a “brand reset” for Grey Goose vodka this year to “reconnect” with consumers, according to the brand’s chief marketing officer.",30 January 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/01/Lee-Applbaum-Bacardi.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/01/grey-goose-vodka-to-get-brand-reset-in-april/,"Bacardi is planning a “brand reset” for Grey Goose vodka this year to “reconnect” with consumers, according to the brand’s chief marketing officer.

Speaking to The Spirits Business last month, Patrón and Grey Goose chief marketing officer Lee Applbaum said that he plans to launch a “new brand creative platform” for the vodka in April.

“It’s more important than ever that brands are transparent and have integrity,” said Applbaum.

“The beauty of Grey Goose, much like Patrón, is that we have that. The challenge is around emotional connectivity, so this year we will have a ‘brand reset’ rather than a brand relaunch. It’s resetting the brand and creating that emotional connectivity.”

While details of the ‘brand reset’ are being kept under wraps, Applbaum said he has “no desire to throw out what continues to work for the brand”.

“We have a very iconic package, a very iconic logo, there’s so many things about the brand that are working incredibly well. It’s going to be more about the tone and the softer side of the emotional connectivity of the brand. Authenticity is critically important, whether that’s expressed in terms of transparency or integrity.”

Grey Goose experienced a double-digit decline of 13.3% to 3.5 million nine-litre cases in 2017 – the brand’s biggest decline in five years – according to Brand Champions data.

Applbaum, who took on the additional position of chief marketing officer for Grey Goose last year, notes that the super-premium vodka category “is incredibly competitive and has been declining on the whole”.

He said: “The growth in vodka has not been coming from the premium space and so our challenge with Grey Goose is not only about the brand but about reenergising and reigniting consumer and trade interest in super-premium vodka. It’s as much a category challenge as it is a brand challenge.”

He added that the challenge for Grey Goose is “relatability”, which will be addressed in the new push.

“Consumers are having a hard time connecting emotionally with Grey Goose. Consumers understand that it’s a luxury brand and is something that is meant for celebrations. What we’ve lost is that realisation that every moment has the potential to be a celebration. So our energy with the brand is focussed on reconnecting with the consumers.”

On managing both Patrón Tequila and Grey Goose, Applbaum added that “the hope is to continue to exploit synergies between the two brands” overtime.",Grey Goose vodka to get ‘brand reset’
Researchers claim to have identified the main cause for gender bias within the spirits industry – tulip-shaped glasses.,30 January 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2017/12/Whisky-280x280.gif,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/01/report-pinpoints-primary-cause-of-gender-bias-in-spirits/,"Researchers claim to have identified the main cause for gender bias within the spirits industry – tulip-shaped glasses.

Tulip-shaped, or copita, glasses have long been used for nosing and tasting spirits, and have been designed to concentrate the aromas of the liquid.

However, a new report – Applying Physics and Sensory Sciences to Spirits Nosing Vessel Design to Improve Evaluation Diagnostics and Drinking Enjoyment – suggests these glasses have been a primary cause for “female exclusion” due to women’s heightened sense of smell compared to men.

Commissioned by Arsilica, which owns glassware company Neat, the research revealed that in a simple ‘A/B’ preference test, 98% of women preferred an “open-rim, engineering nosing vessel, which diverts ethanol (A), over the tulip, which concentrates ethanol (B)”.

It also showed that 30% of women “refused testing, averse to olfactory pain to tulips”.

For men, 87% of those surveyed preferred option ‘A’, and “none experienced olfactory pain”.

All participants chosen for the study were well-known to the author, Christine Crnek, co-founder and CEO of Arsilica, and comprised spirits industry executives, collectors and aficionados, spirits judges, bartenders, brand ambassadors, certified sommeliers, spirits distributors and buyers, competition and tasting organisers, and members of international spirits clubs.

The exception was participants in ‘Consumer Test I’, who were all random attendees at spirits events.

Glassware put to the test during the study included the snifter, Glencairn, copita, an ‘engineered vessel’ and a tumbler.

The study proposed a modified social position to “balance gender participation” in the spirits world.

It stated: “The industry has a golden opportunity to balance gender participation and much to gain from expanding straight spirits markets to include more sensitive female noses.

“As a bonus, males with more sensitive noses will participate. Modifying social stance requires no investment, and there are many areas for improvement.”

Christine Crnek, co-founder and CEO of Arsilica, said: “Fifty years ago, Scotch, whiskies, Tequilas and rum target markets were solidly male, and gender-neutral social norms were not a consideration.

“Our research uncovered a major reason for predominantly male participation and female exclusion among straight spirits drinkers: tulip glasses which concentrate painful nose-numbing ethanol.

“According to sensory science, females have far superior noses, and ethanol is an anaesthetic which quickly hinders aroma detection and appreciation. It’s been under our noses all along, yet no one noticed.”",Glassware blamed for gender bias in spirits
Island-based Scotch whisky maker Raasay Distillery has teamed up with distributor Vision Wine & Spirits to enter the US market.,31 January 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/01/Raasay-Distillery.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/01/raasay-distillery-appoints-us-distributor/,"Island-based Scotch whisky maker Raasay Distillery has teamed up with distributor Vision Wine & Spirits to enter the US market.

Vision Wine & Spirits will distribute Raasay Distillery’s While We Wait expressions in the US and will eventually also look after the distillery’s single malt bottlings, which will come of age in 2020.

Raasay began producing whisky in September 2017 and is owned by independent Scottish whisky company R&B Distillers.

Following a successful barley variety trial on the island in 2017, Raasay Distillery has the ultimate long-term objective of growing sufficient barley on Raasay to produce at least one batch per year of single malt made with 100% Raasay barley, local water and peat from the northern part of the island.

Co-founder Alasdair Day said: “It is the location; an island off an island with complex geology, water and island climate with probably the best views from any distillery in Scotland that makes Raasay ideal for our innovative Scotch whisky distillery.”

Last year, the Island distillery released the latest whisky in its While We Wait series, which is said to have a “smokiness on first nosing, mixed with red berries, lemon, lime and grassy notes”.

Organic operating profit for the period increased by 12.3% to reach £2.4bn (US$3.1bn).

In reported terms, which takes into account exchange rate movements and acquisitions or disposals, net sales grew 5.8%, while reported operating profit was up 11%. Free cash flow sits at £1.3bn (US$1.7bn), up £317 million (US$415.8m).

The Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff producer also said it would buy back £660m ($866.9m) worth of shares, bringing its total buyback programme to £3bn (US$3.9bn) for the year ending 30 June 2019. Last July, the firm said it would purchase £2bn (US$2.6bn) worth of shares.

The group’s Scotch portfolio was up 7%, bolstered by Asia Pacific, Latin America and Caribbean and North America, but partially offset by a decline in Europe. Johnnie Walker led the growth of Scotch with a 10% gain, while sales of primary Scotch brands also increased by 10%, driven by White & Black.

Vodka “returned to growth”, with sales up 3% thanks to growth in all regions. This increase was partially offset by a continuing decline for Cîroc vodka, sales for which plummeted 12%. Smirnoff witnessed a “strong” performance outside the US, growing sales by 2% overall, while Ketel One reported an impressive gain of 21%.

US whiskey increased by 4% and Canadian whisky grew by 5% after solid performances from both Bulleit Bourbon and Crown Royal.

Gin sales leapt 28%, with double-digit gains across all regions except North America. In particular Gordon’s and Tanqueray performed strongly in Europe.

Tequila posted a 29% net sales increase driven by the “strong double-digit growth” of Don Julio in the US, Latin America and Caribbean, along with Casamigos Tequila in the US.

Baileys cream liqueur grew by 3%, aided by the “continued focus” on the brand’s “indulgent treat year-round positioning”.

Last month, Diageo completed the sale of 19 non-priority brands to US company Sazerac ahead of schedule in a deal worth US$550 million. The sale “resulted in an exceptional gain before taxation of £154m (US$202.3m)”.

“Diageo delivered broad-based volume and organic net sales growth across regions and categories,” said chief executive Ivan Menezes.

“We continue to expand organic operating margins while increasing investment in our brands ahead of organic net sales growth.

“These results are further evidence of the changes we have made in Diageo to put the consumer at the heart of our business, to embed productivity and to act with agility to enable us to win sustainably.”

The deal includes the Italian firm’s entire spirits and liqueur business, along with land for the construction of a new production facility. The purchase price is up to €23.5 million (US$27m) with an additional €3m (US$3.4m) for the land, payable in three tranches.

As part of the deal, Stock Spirits will obtain a long-term lease of the historic Borgo San Vitale site, the distillery and visitor centre.

The transaction also includes the Franciacorta wine brands, however the vendor will retain the wine manufacturing operations.

Completion of the agreement, which is conditional upon consultation with trade unions as well as certain restructuring steps, is projected to happen in the second quarter of the year.

Distillerie Franciacorta, which is based in Franciacorta, in the Lombardy region of Italy, was founded in 1901.

According to IWSR figures, the grappa category is Italy’s fourth-largest spirits category with the Franciacorta brands positioned to grow by 5% in value from 2016 to 2017 in the premium price segment.

Stock Spirits will become the number one branded grappa business by value in the Italian off-trade as a result of the deal.

Distillerie Franciacorta’s unaudited sales reached €9.7m (US$11.1m) in 2018. Pro-forma operating profit was €2m (US$2.2m). The value of the gross assets of the Italian business is expected to be €12m (US$13.7m) upon completion.

Stock Spirits expects the deal will produce “neutral” earnings in the first complete year of ownership with profits enhanced thereafter when it is expected to exceed the cost of capital.

The UK-headquartered firm sees “clear synergies with its existing operations” in the on-trade, where it can “leverage Distillerie Franciacorta’s strong presence”, and in the off-trade, where the “acquired brands will benefit from Stock Spirits’ current strengths”.

Stefano Gozio, one of the selling shareholders of Distillerie Franciacorta and a member of the founding Gozio family, will continue to act as a brand ambassador and consultant to Distillerie Franciacorta.

“We are delighted that a business that so clearly understands our values, brands and heritage is acquiring Distillerie Franciacorta,” said Gozio.

“Mirek and his team at Stock Spirits have made it clear that they will nurture and grow the Franciacorta brands, and that they realise the importance of maintaining production locally.

“We are thrilled to be joining their operations, and look forward to an exciting new chapter for everyone associated with Distillerie Franciacorta.”

Mirek Stachowicz, chief executive of Stock Spirits, said: “This is a truly compelling opportunity that we have been looking at for more than a year now, and we see clear and attractive synergies with our existing Italian operations.

“Distillerie Franciacorta’s deep expertise in local, premium products resonates strongly with Stock Spirits’ wider strategy of investing in well-loved national brands with genuine and high quality provenance.

“This is our first step in pursuing in-market consolidation opportunities in Italy, and Distillerie Franciacorta will strengthen our position in what is a fragmented but highly attractive market for us. It should also be seen as a clear reflection of our willingness to undertake value-creating M&A as part of our four-pillar growth strategy.

“We welcome Stefano and look forward to working with him in the next phase of the Distillerie Franciacorta story.”

However, the deal has been criticised by Western Gate – Stock Spirits’ largest shareholder – following calls for the removal of Stock Spirits’ chairman and senior independent director over concerns regarding “significant shareholder value destruction”.

A spokesperson for Western Gate said: “Assuming this is a cash acquisition, it will be immaterial to the company’s balance sheet.

“Stock Spirits will continue to have the lowest net debt/EBITDA position among its peers and its ability to deliver cash back to shareholders through a higher and or special dividend or do further M&A is unchanged.

“This simply does not go far enough and is another example of Stock Spirits only acting under pressure from shareholders.”",Stock Spirits buys Distillerie Franciacorta

Speaking at a media briefing yesterday following the publication of the group’s H1 results, CEO Ivan Menezes said that the UK-based firm is “very keen to get to a deal in the next few weeks”.

“We don’t see a material impact to the company out of the Brexit outcomes but we very definitely want a deal and we’re working very closely with the government and publicly supporting the need to get to a deal,” Menezes said.

The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019.

He added that Diageo “is in a relatively privileged position” compared to other industries when it comes to the impact of Brexit.

“Our supply chain is more indigenous and simple,” he said. “So if you think of what we make in Scotland, it’s water, barley, peat, women, men and lots of time, whisky resting on hills and then exported at very high value. So our ability to manage supply chains relative to other industries is better.”

Menezes said the long-term “potential upside opportunities” are new free trade deals and the “return of duty free to the UK”.

“Final point I’d say is that there are some countries where the EU has free trade agreements where we are working very closely with the UK government and the UK government is working with those countries to ensure that the UK gets the same arrangements as exist today for the EU. Should those not happen, they’re still manageable and they are not on a scale to be material to the government.”

Menezes added that Diageo’s “stock levels are appropriate” and “kept at the right level”.

David Cutter, president of global supply and procurement, said the company is “very confident” about stock levels.

He said: “We manage the end-to-end supply chain all the time and we manage all forms of volatility, nothing out of the ordinary is in place for us.

“We ship to warehouses around the world to satisfy the needs of what’s coming out, so nothing in terms of pre-shipments, nothing over and above normal.”",Diageo CEO: Brexit will have no ‘material impact’

Corazón Tequila is produced at the Casa San Matias Distillery in Los Altos de Jalisco, Mexico. The core range will be available from on- and off-trade establishments across Australia, while the Expresiones del Corazón will be available through leading Tequila and whisky bars.

Laura Pashby, senior brand manager at South Trade International, said: “Corazón is made from 100% Blue Weber agave using traditional clay ovens.

“After the second distillation, oxygen is infused into Corazón Tequila – this process produces a spirit that is softer and more approachable, with an enhanced aroma and distinct flavours.

“We are confident that this taste profile will resonate strongly with both bartenders and consumers in Australia.”

In the Wine and Spirit Trade Association’s (WSTA) latest Market Report, the equivalent of 27.6m bottles of US whiskey were exported to the UK in 2018.

The equivalent of approximately 5.5m bottles of imported whiskey – mostly from the US – were sold in pubs, bars and restaurants in the 12 months to November 2018.

In total, the imported whiskey category – which includes US, Japan and Ireland, among others – was worth almost £800m (US$1 billion) in the last 12 months.

The WSTA said the growth in US whiskey comes despite a 25% tariff on the product, imposed in June 2018 by the European Commission in response to president Donald Trump’s tax hikes on imported aluminium and steel.

In addition, the WSTA said that the UK government “has an opportunity to develop trade agreements” outside the EU.

The WSTA is calling on the UK government to focus on suspending the 25% retaliatory tariff on US whiskey “to protect consumers from price hikes”.

The UK alcohol industry is one of the most heavily taxed in Europe and has the fourth highest duty rate for spirits across the EU.

Spirits duty provides £9.1bn (US$11.8bn) to Treasury coffers and creates around 284,000 UK jobs.

Miles Beale, chief executive of the WSTA, said: “The good news is that UK consumers now enjoy a greater choice of Bourbons and American whiskeys than ever before.

“More and more we find consumers are looking to try a new drink experience which has encouraged spirit producers, including US exporters to introduce new products to the UK market over the last decade.

“Unfortunately, Brits will start to see the price of these drinks rise because of punishing tariffs.”

The TTB was forced to cease operating while the US federal government underwent a partial shutdown over Christmas and into January.

This was due to a political gridlock regarding US$5 billion of federal funding for US president Donald Trump’s border wall between the US and Mexico.

During the shutdown, thousands of government employees of agencies deemed non-essential were made to take temporary, unpaid leave until an agreement was made on the funding bill.

Federal employees returned to work earlier this week following 35 days without pay – marking the longest federal shutdown in US history.

The TTB has addressed a number of questions about its operations in a public statement, which said: “We recognise that TTB approvals are critical to your businesses, and that the partial government closure over the past five weeks may have adversely affected your operations.

“The permit, formula and label submissions received during the funding lapse roughly doubled our existing backlog prior to the shutdown, at which time we were on average achieving our service standards of 15 days for label and formula applications and 75 days for permit applications.

“We are still assessing the overall effect of the shutdown on our service levels going forward, and we are committed to working diligently to process these applications and restore normal operations as quickly as possible. We encourage you to monitor TTB.gov for the latest information regarding our processing times.”

As part of its “recovery efforts”, the TTB said it is developing ways to streamline processes, redeploying staff to “critical” areas, authorising the use of overtime where appropriate and applying “risk-based enforcement” methods to address compliance issues that may have occurred during the shutdown.

The TTB has advised applicants that they can help its efforts in numerous ways, including: withdrawing applications that have been submitted but are no longer required; waiting to submit applications until the final formulation or label has been chosen, as multiple submissions with alterations will exasperate the backlog; ensuring any applications are correct and complete; checking the TTB website for guidance and help, and using phone and email to contact the TTB to minimise inquiries needing a response.

The TTB also said: “We will provide an update on our efforts to restore normal operations and service levels when additional information is available, and thank you for your understanding as we work to address these challenges.”

Gregg Doud, chief agricultural negotiator in the office of the US trade representative, and Kim Darroch, UK ambassador to the US, signed two agreements for wine and spirits on 31 January 2019.

The deal ensures that mutual protection for Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, Scotch whisky and Irish whiskey will “continue uninterrupted” when the UK departs the EU in March 2019.

Currently, the US has agreements on wine and distilled spirits with the EU which cover trade with the UK as part of its membership in the EU.

“Ensuring that our flagship spirits exports – Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey – will continue to be protected provides our companies much-needed assurances as the UK negotiates its departure from the EU,” said Distilled Spirits Council president and CEO Chris Swonger.

“On behalf of all of our American whiskey producers, we thank the US government and the staff of the US-UK trade and investment working group for securing this important outcome.”

The UK was the top export market for US distilled spirits in 2017, totalling US$187 million, and the largest single market for American whiskey exports, totalling almost US$150m.

Distinctive product recognition for Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey by the EU was established through a reciprocal agreement with the US in 1994.

The acknowledgment is critical to ensure that only products labelled and sold in the EU as ‘Bourbon’ and ‘Tennessee whiskey’ are made in the US and follow US regulations.

In the group’s H1 results, net sales of Captain Morgan fell by 4% making it the only one of Diageo’s ‘global giants’ to decline during the final six months of 2018.

More broadly, rum was Diageo’s only spirits category to decline in the period, falling by 3%. This was largely attributed to Captain Morgan’s performance in the US, which decreased 9% and “lost share in a declining category”.

Speaking at a Diageo roundtable last week, CEO Ivan Menezes said “rum has been tough for us”.

He said: “The spirits sector is so dynamic in the US. [It’s] very attractive, fast growing, premiumising nicely [with] lots of excitement in whisk(e)y and lots of excitement in Tequila.

“Even vodka brands that are on trend are doing really well. Rum is a more muted category. It’s been tougher. Captain Morgan, as a result, is not performing well. It’s not in growth.

“We’re very focused on getting the energy back into Captain Morgan so there’s a lot of work going on on that. It will take time.”

In terms of volume sales, Captain Morgan was in growth in the 2017 calendar year, hitting 11.7 million cases, up 9.3% compared to 2016 according to Brand Champions data. The brand boasted the highest rate of growth for any international rum brand.

Vodka “returned to growth”, with sales up 3% thanks to growth in all regions. This increase was partially offset by a continuing decline for Cîroc vodka, sales for which plummeted 12%.

“Captain Morgan and Cîroc are the two that are weak and declining,” said Menezes. “We’re putting our best minds and efforts against it, but it will take time for it to get back into healthy shape.”

Gin and Tequila were the star performers of the period, with both categories posting double-digit gains of 28% and 29%, respectively. Don Julio and Casamigos, the latter of which Diageo acquired in 2017, helped to boost Tequila’s growth.

Last March, the group acquired German vermouth Belsazar, which was one of the first brands to join the UK drinks group’s growth accelerator programme, Distill Ventures.

Kathryn Mikells, chief financial officer at Diageo, said the group is “making smaller acquisitions and investments through Distill Ventures all the time”.

“We look a lot but you should expect that we’re going to be pretty picky in terms of what we transact on but we continue to look.

“In this last half, we increased our investment in Sichuan Shuijingfang Company (SJF) from 40% to 60% so we continue to look for opportunities that we think are good ones for the company as we’re trying to build a portfolio that doesn’t just give us consistent results today but our seeding of the smaller brands is what we’re going to need 10 to 20 years from now.”",Diageo ‘very focused’ on invigorating Captain Morgan

The deal was made through the US firm’s venture capital arm, Constellation Brands Ventures, which makes investments in emerging brands that “provide strong scalability, consumer appeal and a point of differentiation in the market”.

Rochester-based Black Button produces Straight Bourbon Whiskey, Citrus Forward Gin, seasonal Lilac Gin and Bespoke Bourbon Cream. Each expression is distilled from New York state grains and then aged, bottled and labelled in Rochester.

Founded in 2012 by entrepreneur Jason Barrett, Black Button is thought to be Rochester’s first grain-to-glass craft distillery. In 2016, the site expanded to include a tasting room and retail store.

The company’s sales have more than tripled since 2014, and in 2017 Black Button expanded to Buffalo, New York with the opening of a tasting room and bottle shop.

Last year, Black Button launched a crowdfunding campaign to create a smallholding where it can grow produce such as juniper berries and American white oak for its own spirits production.

“For us to continue the growth rate we believe we are capable of, it was time to find an equity partner,” said Barrett. “But we didn’t want just any equity partner. We wanted someone who understood our business, our culture and our goals.

“We found that partner right in our back yard. Constellation shares our love of western New York and they are also committed to the agricultural roots that are so important to Black Button.

“This partnership is great for our employees, our ownership, our farmers and our consumers because we will be able to bring more great Black Button products to our community.”

Constellation Brands’ president and chief operating officer, and incoming CEO Bill Newlands, said: “Black Button has a proven track record of producing premium craft spirits that resonate with consumers and they have a variety of products that are aligned to consumer trends and fill white space within Constellation’s spirits portfolio.

“With our shared knowledge, experience and guidance, we will work together to help Black Button grow and expand the brands that craft spirits enthusiasts have come to know and love.”

The past 12 months have seen Constellation Brands make a number of investments in the alcohol industry.

In December, the firm completed its first investments in Texas-based bottled cocktail company Austin Cocktails and premium alcohol producer Vivify Beverages through its venture capital arm. The deals were announced as part of plans to invest US$100 million in women-led alcohol businesses over the next 10 years.

Last January, Constellation Brands acquired minority stakes in two spirits firms: the Copper & Kings American Brandy Co and The Real McCoy Rum.

In 2016, the US drinks group acquired craft whiskey producer High West Distillery for around US$160m.

Constellation also made a move into the burgeoning cannabis sector in 2017. The group upped its investment in Canopy Growth Corporation to US$4 billion – the largest investment in the cannabis industry to date. The firm first bought a stake in Canopy Growth in October 2017.",Constellation buys minority stake in Black Button

Mallya, who is also the former chairman of Kingfisher Airlines and ex-owner of the Force India Formula One team, left India in 2016 after allegedly defaulting on debts of more than £1 billion, most of which was associated with his defunct airline.

The tycoon has maintained he made an “unconditional” offer to pay what he owned in full last year.

Mallya was arrested then bailed by the Metropolitan Police on behalf of Indian authorities in London in 2017. In December 2018, a judged ruled that the businessman should be sent back to India for trial over allegations he misled Indian banks on how loans paid to him would be used.

Last week, on 3 February, home secretary Javid signed the order for Mallya’s extradition to India “having carefully considered all relevant matters”.

A statement from the Home Office continued: “Vijay Mallya is accused in India of conspiracy to defraud, making false representations and money laundering offences.”

Mallya said on Twitter that he planned to appeal the extradition order. He has 14 days to do so.

Diageo, which is the majority owner of Indian drinks firm United Spirits, is separately suing Mallya for at least US$180 million through the High Court in London.

The maker of Johnnie Walker is seeking repayment of the US$40m lump sum paid as severance to Mallya when he stepped down as chairman of United Spirits in 2016. Diageo is seeking a further US$141m, which the group claims it is owed by Watson Limited, a company affiliated with Mallya.",UK govt approves Vijay Mallya extradition to India

Jameson increased by 8%, bolstered by the US market, price increases across all regions and the “momentum” of the company’s globalisation strategy.

Absolut vodka fell by 1% due to the US market. Outside of the US, the brand witnessed a 4% growth.

Malibu rum liqueur decreased by 5% attributed mainly to shipment phasing in the US. The brand’s H2 performance is expected to be stronger.

Beefeater gin grew by 9% with strong performances across all regions. Beefeater Pink, which was released in April last year, witnessed “good development”, particularly in the UK.

The category benefited from the “very strong growth” of Lillet apèritif (+38%), Monkey 47 gin (+21%) and the double-digit performance of Altos Tequila in Europe, the Americas and Asia.

Geographically, the Americas delivered a “robust growth” of 4% with the US “growing broadly in line with the market”.

Asia and the rest of the world region witnessed a double-digit growth of 16%, boosted by China, India, Africa and the Middle East.

Alexandre Ricard, chairman and CEO, said the first semester of the plan “was very strong”.

He said: “While enhanced by phasing, it confirms the acceleration of our growth, resulting from our long-term investment strategy.

“For full-year 2019, in an environment that remains uncertain, we aim to continue dynamic and diversified growth across our regions and brands.

“By the end of June 2019, we will have completed our operational excellence plan announced in 2016, delivering €200m (US$226.7m) of profit and loss (P&L) savings one year ahead of plan.

“We will continue to roll out our strategic plan, focused on investing for sustainable and profitable long-term growth.”

Founded in 2010, the company has almost doubled in both size and turnover in the last 18 months, and will use the investment for national and international expansion.

In order to do this, The Speakeasy Group is looking for investors to put forward any monetary amount from AU$500 to AU$10,000 through crowdfunding platform Birchal. In return, shareholders will be given owner privileges and yearly dividends.

Explaining the fundraising objectives, The Speakeasy Group said in a statement: “With a maximum target of $3 million, should we reach our goal the funds will also go towards fulfilling owners Greg and Sven’s long-term goal of funding a venue that will be opened in collaboration with some of the group’s staff members including the incredible team at Boilermaker House.”

Expansion plans include opening Boilermaker House in Sydney and other Australian states, as well as opening another Nick & Nora’s venue in Melbourne.

According to trade body the Irish Whiskey Association (IWA), the registration will give the industry a greater ability to combat fakes.

“The registration of Irish whiskey as a certification mark in Australia is a major achievement in our efforts to protect the integrity of Irish whiskey in Australia as a significant export market,” said Carleen Madigan, legal advisor for the IWA.

“This registration means Irish whiskey for the first time is protected and defined in Australian law, which will greatly enhance our ability to take action against rogue traders. This will ensure Irish whiskey maximises its potential and maintains its growth trajectory.”

Australia is a top 10 export market for Irish whiskey and is growing rapidly. In 2017, 1.9 million bottles were sold in Australia, and in the first 10 months of 2018, volume exports grew 35%.

Last year, the IWA launched a major drive to combat the sale of counterfeit Irish whiskey around the world, tripling its legal budget for 2019.

Irish whiskey gained greater legal protection in Asia following the signing of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement last summer.

The Irish whiskey industry is targeting global sales of 12m cases by 2020, which the IWA said it is on track to exceed. The category’s largest export in 2017 was the US, followed by Ireland and Russia.",Australia agrees to protect Irish whiskey

The acquisition of Penrith-based Eden River Brewery will allow Eden Mill to bottle and distribute “quickly and effectively” and will increase its capacity by 50,000 nine-litre cases, creating an additional 12 jobs at the plant.

Based in St Andrews, Eden Mill became Scotland’s first combined brewery and distillery in 2012. Since then, the group has “rapidly” grown its retail footprint.

Following the acquisition, Eden Mill will continue to distil its whisky and gin and brew its beer in St Andrews. The group released its inaugural range of single malts – the Hip Flask Series – in April last year.

“Thanks to a growth trend amongst our customer base and our ongoing partnership with big retailers such as Aldi, Tesco and Sainsbury’s, our acquisition of Eden River Brewery will allow us to drastically increase our production on many of our products,” said Paul Miller, co-founder of Eden Mill.

“Eden River Brewery is highly complementary to our business and we share commonalities in products and approach, making us hugely excited about our combined potential.”

Jason Hill, director of Eden River, added: “When we were approached by Eden Mill, I knew immediately that this was the kind of company, and the right team of people we could work with.

“We all had a vision of the quality products and identified that highlighting the ‘craft’ aspects of our products would allow for us to expand yet stay personal to our customers.”

Freelance food journalist Victoria Stewart and restaurant public relations (PR) officer Hannah Norris are set to launch a not-for-profit platform that aims to tackle harassment in the hospitality industry.,7 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/02/Hospitality-Speaks.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/campaign-to-address-toxic-behaviour-in-hospitality/,"Freelance food journalist Victoria Stewart and restaurant public relations (PR) officer Hannah Norris are set to launch a not-for-profit platform that aims to tackle harassment in the hospitality industry.

The initiative, called Hospitality Speaks, will launch at the end of March 2019 to address “toxic behaviour” in the hospitality industry.

Stewart, the former Evening Standard food editor, and Norris, founder of Nourish PR, have launched the platform to create a “safe online space” for hospitality workers to share their stories of bullying, harassment and discrimination, anonymously.

“The aim is to get conversation started and allow people to talk about their stories and alleviate stress,” Norris told The Spirits Business.

The platform’s website claims that “neither the hospitality industry nor the public are aware of the extent of toxic behaviour” and that “not enough action is being taken to prevent it or make it easy to report”.

Stewart wrote on the website: “Over a year ago, I became aware of specific examples of toxic behaviour in a number of establishments which prevented me from feeling I could continue covering them.

“Following a number of interviews, I discovered that the problems were not only widespread, but that people didn’t feel able to talk about them.”

The initiative also aims to raise awareness of “pioneering employers across the industry who have found innovative solutions for creating positive culture and retaining staff” and to give the public “an informed choice on where to eat and drink”.

Hospitality Speaks will seek to create a “hospitality industry standard for behaviour and ethics” and look to “shake up the media narrative on both sides”.

In addition, Hospitality Speaks will hold a series of events and discussions, and publish a page of contacts for professional help and legal counsel.

The platform comes after the tsunami of sexual misconduct allegations in various industries and the advance of the #MeToo movement that highlighted the ubiquity of sexual abuse.

The UK drinks giant first announced plans to build a new ‘state-of-the-art’ Johnnie Walker experience in April last year as part of a £150 million (US$215m) investment into its Scotch whisky visitor centres.

The new Edinburgh site at 146 Princes Street will be the “focal point” of the company’s investment. The project is estimated to create between 160 and 180 full-time jobs, and generate in the region of £135m (US$173.5m) in tourism spend for Edinburgh’s economy.

It will be “directly linked” to four distilleries representing the “four corners of Scotland” and Scotch whisky’s regional flavour profiles: Glenkinchie (Lowlands), Cardhu (Speyside), Caol Ila (Island) and Clynelish (Highlands). The connection will create a “Johnnie Walker tour of Scotland” to encourage tourists to travel to Edinburgh and other rural Scottish locations.

David Cutter, chairman of Diageo in Scotland, said: “The location is one of Edinburgh’s most exceptional landmark buildings and we plan to restore it to its former glory as a cornerstone of the city and a thriving part of its cultural and social life.

“We have the most passionate and skilled whisky-makers in the world here in Scotland and we want to celebrate their craft and everything that is great about Scotland and whisky.”

Diageo and building owner Parabola jointly submitted the planning application for a seven-floor visitor experience.

Plans for the landmark building, the former site of department store House of Fraser, include the restoration of the site’s heritage features where possible, which will be integrated into the new development.

The “multi-sensory, immersive” experience will occupy three floors of the site, taking visitors through the 200-year history of the brand, the art and science of whisky-making and a journey through the flavours of Scotland.

In addition to the visitor experience, the space will feature rooftop bars and a “flexible” events space for music, theatre, arts and community events.

The venue will include a bar academy that will house Diageo’s Learning for Life programme. The programme will create training and employment opportunities in the hospitality industry for unemployed people, and aim to improve hospitality standards and promote responsible alcohol use.

The site will also include a “significant” retail space on the ground floor, inspired by the Johnnie Walker experiential flagship store in Madrid.

The iconic clock on the corner of Princes Street and Hope Street will also be restored.

Cristina Diezhandino, Diageo global Scotch whisky director, said: “Our ambition is to create a visitor experience that will rank not only as one of the greatest whisky attractions of the world, but one of the greatest brand attractions in any industry, putting Scotland at the forefront of the global boom in experiential travel.”

The investment has been pledged in addition to Diageo’s £35m (US$44.9m) project to bring Port Ellen and Brora back into production. Both distilleries will also feature visitor centres.",Plans submitted for Johnnie Walker centre in Edinburgh

The latest statistics from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), released by the Wine & Spirit Trade Association (WSTA), showed that British exports of the juniper-based spirit were worth £612m (US$788.5m) in 2018 – an increase of 15% year on year.

UK gin exports are now worth more than double the sales in 2010, which hit just over £288m (US$371m). Gin sales overseas are worth 28% more than beer sales.

The largest importer of UK gin is the US, with sales worth £191m (US$246m), up £13m (US$16.7m) on 2017.

Australia doubled its gin spend compared to 2017, with sales reaching £14.4m (US$18.5m) last year. South Africa saw its British gin sales reach £14.5m – a 222% increase on 2017 from £4.5m (US$5.8m).

Switzerland increased by 38% last year to £6.6m (US$8.5m), up from £4.8m (US$6.1m).

The EU is the biggest region for UK gin, which was worth almost £290m (US$373m) in 2018 – an increase of 14% from the previous year.

In 2017, British gin exports reach an all-time high – breaking the £500m (US$644m) barrier to reach £530m (US$683m) – and the WSTA has previously forecast that a new record will be set in 2018.

The WSTA is now calling on the UK government to support British gin exporters. The trade body is also running a series of export missions to showcase British spirits producers.

WSTA chief executive Miles Beale said: “The global thirst for British gin shows no sign of slowing and there is no doubt that those overseas are drawn to the quality of gin made here in the UK.

“Europe represents a huge market for British gin, therefore it is essential that the UK does not leave the EU without securing a deal which allows frictionless trade.

“It is hugely important that government also secures free trade deals with the rest of the world and we are encouraged by mutual recognition agreements already signed with countries like Australia and Switzerland.

“However, more must be done, and quickly, so that we maintain our position as the world’s largest spirits exporter and further boost the UK economy and provide more jobs.”",British gin exports break £600m barrier

Devils River Whiskey president and co-founder, Mike Cameron, said: “Our goal is to be in more than 30 states by the end of 2019.

“Leading the aggressive expansion plan requires a strong team. We’re assembling a great group of the right men and women to get this done.

“We have divided the country into five regions and are proud of the talent that we’re bringing together to drive our market expansion.”

Potts has joined Devils River after working with vodka brand Deep Eddy and holding leadership roles at Republic National Distributing Company.

He said: “I’m thrilled to be leading sales and marketing for this ambitious undertaking.”

In preparation for the expected growth, the company will open the doors to its San Antonio distillery later this year.

“We are in the processes of renovating the first two floors of the Burns building located at 401 E Houston Street,” said Cameron.

“Built in 1918, the Burns building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. We are excited to be part of San Antonio’s downtown revitalisation as our distillery and visitor’s centre will be in the heart of downtown San Antonio.”",Devils River expands leadership team
The Welsh government has moved forward with plans to approve a 50p minimum unit price (MUP) for alcohol in Wales following a public consultation.,18 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2017/10/Wales-alcohol-bill-280x280.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/wales-minimum-unit-pricing-plans-move-forward/,"The Welsh government has moved forward with plans to approve a 50p minimum unit price (MUP) for alcohol in Wales following a public consultation.

The Public Health Minimum Price for Alcohol Bill was introduced before the National Assembly for Wales on 23 October 2017 by public health minister Rebecca Evans. The bill was approved in June last year and is expected to come into effect this summer.

It addresses health concerns around the effects of excess alcohol consumption, which is estimated to lead to 55,000 alcohol-related hospital admissions a year, costing the Welsh NHS £150 million (US$194m) annually. In 2017, there were 540 alcohol-related deaths in Wales.

The level of MUP was subject to a consultation by Welsh ministers. After assessing responses to the consultation, ministers have remained settled on a 50p MUP as a “proportionate response to tackling the health risks of excessive alcohol consumption”.

The Welsh government will specify regulations for the 50p MUP to the National Assembly for Wales, for its consideration later this year.

Health minister Vaughan Gething said: “Following a public consultation, I’m pleased to confirm we will now ask the National Assembly for Wales to approve a 50p minimum unit price.

“We believe a 50p minimum unit price strikes a reasonable balance between the anticipated public health and social benefits and intervention in the market.

“We will continue to use all available levers to reduce the harms caused by the excessive consumption of alcohol, as we develop and take forward a new delivery plan for substance misuse.”

The consultation also discussed the “potential unintended consequences” of a 50p MUP.

Gething added: “The consultation process raised a number of issues, such as the potential impacts on vulnerable groups, household budgets, the risk of switching to other substances and the potential increase in the number of people seeking support from services. We will continue to consider these potential impacts.

“We have commissioned specific research to look at the risk of switching, which will report ahead of implementation.

“In December 2018, we announced an extra £2.4m in funding for Area Planning Boards for local frontline substance misuse services so that we can ensure services are widely available.

“We have worked closely with Area Planning Boards throughout the development of this legislation and we will continue to do so ahead of implementation.”",Wales minimum unit pricing plans move forward

Penderyn, based in Aberdare, first revealed plans to build its second distillery in Swansea in 2016.

Construction work on the new site is likely to begin at the end of this year and continue throughout 2020 and 2021.

Swansea Council secured £3.5 million (US$4.5m) in funding from the National Lottery for the redevelopment of the historic Hafod Morfa Copperworks building, where the second Penderyn site will be located.

Dating back to 1808, the site is based over 12.5 acres on the west bank of the River Tawe.

The development will be home to the Penderyn Experience whisky tour and is expected to attract more than 50,000 visitors a year.

Plans for the site include a new-build visitor centre with shop, tasting bar, VIP bar, an exhibition space and car park with 60 spaces. There will also be a new barrel store located in part of the rolling mill that houses the Swansea Museums collections store.

A covered walkway will also connect the refurbished powerhouse, visitor centre and barrel store.

Penderyn owner Nigel Short said: “The plans are exciting for us as a business and for Swansea as a community with great plans for its future prosperity.

“Penderyn wants to be a part of the regeneration of the copperworks and repeat the success we already have with our Welsh single malt whisky and other products.”

Council leader Rob Stewart added: “The world-famous Penderyn brand will come to Swansea and one of our most historic sites will be developed in a sensitive and sustainable way.”",Penderyn gains planning approval for second distillery

Only 40 bottles of The Macallan 1926 were released in 1986 following a 60-year maturation period in Sherry casks, each with a £20,000 price tag.

Of these bottles, 12 were given to British pop artist Sir Peter Blake to design, and another 12 were set aside for artist Valerio Adami, with one bottle hand-painted by Irish artist Michael Dillon.

The Sir Peter Blake bottle has been consigned by a UK collector who purchased the bottle upon its release in 1986.

It will now go on sale at a Bonhams Whisky sale on Wednesday 6 March. The whisky is expected to fetch between £500,000 and £700,000 (£645,800-US$904,120).

The highest price paid for a bottle from the Blake series was in May 2018 when a bottle was purchased for £751,703 (US$970,900) at a Bonhams auction in Hong Kong.

In October last year, a bottle of The Macallan Peter Blake 1926 60-year-old Scotch whisky failed to set a new world record when it sold at a Sotheby’s auction in New York for US$843,200.

A month later, the only bottle of 1926 Macallan featuring a hand-painted design by Dillon broke the world record for the most expensive whisky after fetching £1.2 million (US$1.5m) at auction.

Other highlights of the sale next month include a Laphroaig 14-year-old 1970, two bottles of The Dalmore 50-year-old 1926, a Bowmore 40-year-old 1955 and a Springbank 1952.",Macallan 1926 Peter Blake to lead Bonhams auction

The undisclosed investment sum is said to support E&A Scheer’s expansion and continued growth. The Dutch firm claims to be the “largest global blender and vendor of premium rum in bulk”.

Carsten Vlierboom, E&A Scheer managing director, said: “Scheer has been family-owned for most of its 300-year history, so it was important to find a partner who would respect this heritage while helping the company seize the current growth opportunities.

“We look forward to this new chapter with Riverside.”

With origins dating back to 1712, E&A Scheer specialises in sourcing and blending rums. The company’s blending operation is located in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and it also operates ageing facilities in Liverpool, UK, under its Main Rum Company subsidiary.

Riverside partner, Karsten Langer, said: “We are thrilled to add the Scheer investment to our portfolio.

“Rum is the fifth most consumed spirit category in the world, and also one of the fastest growing, due to the emergence of artisanal and craft brands and an ongoing premiumisation of the category.

“These trends play to Scheer’s strengths, and we are excited to help the company’s continued growth.”

For the year ended 31 December 2018, MBWS saw its organic sales drop 6.3% to €389 million (US$440m).

The company’s fourth quarter, which runs from 1 October to 31 December 2018, recorded a 6.2% decrease to €99.5m (US$112.6m).

For Q4, the Western Europe, Middle East and Africa (WEMEA) region saw its net sales drop by 14.6% to €24.3m (US$27.5m). Revenue was impacted by the decline in sales across the spirits sector in France during the first half of 2018 along with “social movements” in November and December.

The value of the spirits market fell by 3% (Nielsen figures) in Q4 with all of MBWS’s main categories “continuing to underperform the overall sector”.

The group said its underperformance was due to a drop in volumes, attributed to a “lower level of promotions” when compared to “intense promotional activity by competitors”, mainly in Scotch whisky and vodka.

Poland saw its sales grow 17.1% to €10.3m (US$11.6m) following a “progressive recovery from the proactive destocking in H1 2018”. The growth was also attributed to a net sales increase in the “modern trade” and distribution agreements signed in H2.

The new Lancut distillery in Poland is expected to begin operating in the coming weeks, MBWS also said.

In the Americas, net sales fell by 44.3% to €5.4m due to the US which “decreased sharply” with the destocking of Sobieski vodka in certain regional markets during the fourth quarter. Sales were also impacted by “pricing pressure” in the US vodka market during the holiday season and “overall pricing” in the category.

Net sales in the Asia Pacific cluster totalled €1.2m in Q4, a decrease of 34%. Distribution deals in Asia “have not enabled the group to meet its objectives”. As part of MBWS’s new strategic plan, a “new approach to the route-to-market” has been put forward.

Net sales for ‘other businesses’ were reported at €41.5m (US$47m), a decrease of 0.8%.

In a document published ahead of its AGM on 31 January, MBWS outlined the difficulties it has faced in recent months and put forward a rescue agreement that it will ask shareholders to approve.

The group has faced weakened market conditions in France and the US, and was hit by a “delay in executing [its] plan of corrective measures in Poland” – a key market where MBWS has long struggled.

The firm’s largest shareholder – French holding company La Compagnie Financière Européenne de Prises de Participation (COFEPP), which owns La Martiniquaise Bardinet – had agreed to offer a rescue investment of €37.7m (US$42.7m).

In the latest update, the principal option of the deal between MBWS and COFEPP was approved by 89% of voting shareholders.

Under the agreement, COFEFF will provide a minimum of €45m (US$51m) in new money to MBWS. A €25m (US$28.3m) bridge loan was granted by COFEPP to MBWS on 4 February 2019.

The operation is currently subject to authorisation from the French anti-trust authorities under conditions considered acceptable by COFEPP. A decision is expected to be made by the end of February 2019.",Marie Brizard full-year sales fall 6%

Jean-Christophe Coutures, CEO of the group’s Scotch whisky business, Chivas Brothers, said Pernod Ricard is “very much in favour of a deal on 29 March”, when the United Kingdom is scheduled to exit the European Union.

“The worst possible thing that could happen is a no-deal scenario as we need visibility in the way the business is going to move forward,” he said.

“At the same time, as a business we have been preparing for the worst and in the last three of four months we have been stocking some dry goods here in the UK and Ireland, which is also impacted. And we have been as well generating some extra finished goods inventory in Pernod Ricard affiliates, so no impact on Pernod Ricard turnover.

“Therefore, we believe we believe we are in a good position to deal with the short-term nightmare of what a no-deal Brexit will generate.”

Coutures also said that “long-term” Pernod Ricard and its competitors will face issues relating to free-trade agreements in some countries around the world.

Also speaking to journalists yesterday (12 February) at a media briefing, Pernod Ricard CEO Alexandre Ricard pointed out that his company is a “net exporter” from the UK due to the size of its Scotch and gin business. As such “if the British pound weakens, from a purely selfish perspective, it is good news for Pernod Ricard”.

He continued: “[Our] ambition to grow our share in the UK will obviously remain unchanged. The UK is the eighth-largest economy in the world and it is a strategic market for Pernod Ricard.”

Alexandre Ricard has also stressed his company “will remain a consolidator” in the industry, following reports that activist investor Elliott Management Corporation had recommended that the Absolut maker should explore the option of a merger.

The French group’s closest rival, Diageo, has also stressed the importance of the UK leaving the EU with a deal, but said it doesn’t anticipate Brexit will have a “material impact” on its business.",Pernod: ‘No-deal Brexit would be short-term nightmare’

Figures released by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), and quoted by the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA), revealed the total export value of Scotch whisky increased 7.8% to reach a record £4.07 billion (US$5.25bn) in 2018.

In volume terms, 1.28bn 700ml bottles were shipped out of Scotland last year – a 3.6% increase compared to the year before.

The EU remains the largest region for Scotch whisky exports, accounting for 30% of global value and 36% of global volume.

Blended Scotch whisky continues to be the backbone of the Scotch whisky sector, with global exports reaching £3.04bn (US$3.92bn) last year.

Karen Betts, CEO of the SWA, said: “These figures underscore strength of the Scotch whisky category, which has continued to grow despite the challenges posed by Brexit and by tensions in the global trading system.

“A key driver for global growth is the growing market for premium spirits. Scotch whisky is in a great position to take advantage of this given its unrivalled reputation for quality, authenticity and provenance.

“However, the industry does not take continued growth for granted. We operate in a competitive global marketplace and so a competitive business environment in Scotland and across the UK is vital to Scotch whisky’s success.

“For Scotch, that means fair and balanced regulation and taxes, including excise duty, to give distillers the confidence to invest in future growth. We also want to see the UK and EU agree to an open and positive future relationship, which delivers frictionless trade with the EU, and the UK to secure ambitious trading relationships with key markets around the world.

“In that context, it is important to our industry, as to many others, that the UK does not leave the EU without a deal at the end of March. We are urging the government and parliamentarians to work together constructively and pragmatically to ensure that an agreement is reached as quickly as possible.”",US is first billion-pound export market for Scotch

In the company’s latest trading update for the period from 1 October 2018 to 14 February 2019, Stock Spirits said it is “on track with its plans for the year as a whole”.

Last month, the group signed a deal to acquire Italian grappa producer Distillerie Franciacorta for €23.5 million (US$27m).

Stock Spirits said the acquisition shows the company’s “willingness to undertake value-creating M&A (mergers and acquisitions) as part of its four pillar growth strategy”.

The firm has previously said that “in the absence of further M&A it would as a matter of course consider returning cash to investors via additional shareholder distributions”.

The deal has been criticised by Western Gate – Stock Spirits’ largest shareholder – following calls for the removal of Stock Spirits’ chairman and senior independent director over concerns regarding “significant shareholder value destruction”.

Western Gate said the acquisition was “another example of Stock Spirits only acting under pressure from shareholders”.

For the three-month period from 1 October to 31 December 2018, the total vodka market grew in value by 2.4% and increased in volume by 0.9% year on year, according to Nielsen figures. The growth was attributed to the flavoured and clear vodka categories.

Stock Spirits said it has “now delivered 20 consecutive months of profitable year-on-year market share growth in a pricing environment which remains very competitive”.

In the Czech Republic, the company’s market share “returned to growth”, with value market share at the end of 2018 (34.2% moving annual total) ahead of 2017 (33.5% MAT).

Meanwhile, in Italy, “the categories in which Stock operates continues to decline”.

Stock Spirits will become the number one branded grappa business by value in the Italian off-trade as a result of the Distillerie Franciacorta deal. This is in addition to the group’s “established brand leadership positions in limoncello, clear and flavoured vodka, and its number two position in brandy”.

At the end of 2018, Stock Spirits received an assessment from the Polish tax authority related to its 2013 pre-IPO intellectual property restructuring and certain other historic intra-group transfer pricing matters.

The company has resolved this valuation with payments, including interest and penalties, of €5.5m (US$6.2m) in total, €1m of which has already been provided for in its accounts.

Stock Spirits is seeking recovery of €4.5m (US$5m) of these payments through the normal appeals process. The company added that “there is no material impact on the financial position or performance of the group arising from this assessment and related payments”.",Stock Spirits announces ‘solid’ start to 2019

In the WSTA’s latest Market Report, gin sales in the UK have been valued at £1.9 billion (US$2.4bn) in 2018 after more than 66 million bottles were sold during the 12-month period.

The WSTA says the growth was down to sales of pink and flavoured gin as new products continue to enter the market.

Flavoured gin sales have driven half of all growth of gin in the UK in the last recorded 12 months, despite only representing one fifth of total sales. Almost three quarters of the flavoured gin category’s growth was boosted by pink gin.

The WSTA attributed the growth of flavoured and pink gin to consumers under the age of 45.

Looking across cocktails, there has also been a surge in popularity for herbal bitter liqueurs and red-orange coloured apèritifs mixed with sparkling wine. The drinks are noted for being “Instagrammable” due to their colour.

UK consumers also purchased more than four million bottles of non-cream liqueur cocktails from supermarkets and shops during the 2018 heatwave. The sales were up by 56% on the same 12 weeks in 2017, the equivalent of an extra 1.4m bottles.

The growth of pink gin comes after a number of drinks companies launched pink line extensions in the past few years, including Gordon’s Pink, Beefeater Pink and Bacardi’s Bosford Rose Premium Gin & Strawberry Liqueur.

Pink gin also boosted the value of Irish gin exports from the Republic of Ireland in the first nine months of 2018, according to a recent report.",Pink gin boosts flavoured gin sales in UK

The US and Japan are Beam Suntory’s two largest markets and reflect the origins of the company, which was formed in 2014 after Japan’s Suntory Holdings acquired Chicago-headquartered Beam Inc.

The group recorded mid-single-digit sales growth in the US and Oceania last year, high-single-digit growth in Europe, and double-digit growth in India, Southeast Asia and China.

Jim Beam Bourbon registered high-single-digit volume growth and surpassed sales of 10 million cases, while Maker’s Mark grew volume sales at a double-digit rate and exceeded 2m cases. According to Brand Champions data, the brand recorded sales of 1.9m cases in 2017.

In an interview published last year, outgoing Beam Suntory CEO Matt Shattock told SB that Maker’s Mark would become a “very big focal point” for the group on a global scale.

Courvoisier Cognac and Canadian Club whisky both witnessed high-single-digit growth, while premium brands Hornitos Tequila, Basil Hayden’s Bourbon and Sipsmith Gin, which Beam Suntory acquired in 2016, experience double-digit gains. Meanwhile, Roku Gin “inspired strong sales”.

According to Shattock, Beam Suntory’s results “reflect the sustained success” of its growth strategy and “unique east-meets-west competitive advantage”.

“We gained share across our largest markets in 2018, while also step-changing our position to capture future growth in emerging markets,” he said.

“Consumers around the world are responding to the authenticity and versatility of Bourbon, and that resulted in strong momentum and premiumisation for our brands as growth accelerated up the price ladder.”

In Japan, Kakubin Japanese whisky, Jim Beam, Torys Japanese spirit and Maker’s Mark “delivered strong growth”, while volume sales of RTDs grew 10% thanks to an emerging food pairing trend.

Combined data shows that French wine and spirits exports broke the €13 billion barrier for the first time last year, up 2.4% to €13.2bn (US$14.8bn), according to the Fédération des Exportateurs de Vins & Spiritueux de France (FEVS).

The volume of French wine and spirits fell by 2.7% due to the “very weak 2017 harvest on wine exports”. Spirits volumes increased to more than 53 million cases, a growth of +1.9%.

Looking across spirits, Cognac grew by 3.4% to 16.7m cases and increased by 1.7% in value to €3.1bn. Armagnac fell by 6.4% in volume and 6.5% by value.

Vodka decreased by 0.4% to 12.2m cases and increased by 17.8% in value. Liqueurs increased by 2.4% to 3.98m cases and decreased by 5.2% in value.

Calvados fell by 10.7% to 261,768 cases and dropped by 8.3% in value. Other wine-based spirits decreased by 2.9% to 9.6m cases and increased by 17.8% in value.

Following its rebound last year, French wine volumes fell by 4.6% “in line with the historically low harvest of 2017”. The value of wine exports increased by 2.6% to €8.9bn.

In the European Union, French wine and spirits generated a turnover of €4.5bn (+2.2%). The increase confirms “the growing importance of third countries in the growth of French wine and spirits”, the FEVS said.

Non-EU countries contributed almost 70% of the increase in turnover last year, with a growth rate of 2.6%.

The US – the leading market for French wine and spirits – maintained “steady” growth with exports up by 4.6% to €3.2bn.

Exports to China fell by double digits to €1bn (-14.4%) amid “slowing economic growth and international trade tensions”.

Antoine Leccia, president of FEVS, said: “The Chinese market is largely supplied via Hong Kong and Singapore, which does not reflect the export figures.

“In 2018, with €2.5 billion, we record our second best year for French wines and spirits exported to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, confirming the long-term dynamics of the Chinese market.”

However, the rest of Asia was said to be “growing strongly”, with sales up by 4.7% to close to €1bn in 2018.

Despite Brexit uncertainties, exports to the UK “stabilised” at €1.3bn (-0.6%).

“We are confident in the ability of our products to meet the demands and expectations of consumers,” said Leccia. “But the current climate of uncertainty makes us particularly vigilant because of our growing presence in the third country markets.

“We rely on the support and the action of the public authorities to support our companies facing the current and future challenges.”",Cognac star performer in French spirits exports

Natterjack Irish Whiskey has been triple-distilled and first matured in ex-Bourbon barrels before finishing in virgin American oak barrels. The whiskey is said to have notes of vanilla, apple and cinnamon on the nose, orange, spice, cedar and tobacco on the palate, with a “clean, fresh finish”.

The whiskey has secured distribution in the Republic of Ireland, the US, China, the UK and other European markets.

Bottled at 40% abv, Natterjack Irish Whiskey will be available in the on- and off-trade at an RRP of €48 (US$54) per 700ml.

Co-founded by Aidan Mehigan, along with two friends and his father, Gortinore Distillers has acquired The Old Mill, Kilmacthomas, in Waterford, which the group intends to renovate into a distillery and visitor centre.

The distillery building, once home to Flahavan’s Irish porridge oats, will house three copper pot stills and warehouse space to store whiskey casks. It is expected the site will employ up to 15 people once operational.

Mehigan said: “Natterjack is an elegant answer for the next generation of whiskey drinkers.

“We’ve set out to marry the knowledge from both sides of the Atlantic, to create a unique fusion of Irish and American whiskey traditions, and bottle it.

“We’re a whiskey company doing things differently, going against the industry trends and creating the best whiskey that we possibly can.

“We’ve explored new flavour profiles, taken the traditional methods of triple distillation, ageing and second-used casks and amplified those with some of the methods used in Bourbon. Our virgin American oak barrels are just that – virgin, brand new and unadulterated with any other flavour.”",Natterjack Irish Whiskey makers to build distillery

Parent company Mast-Jägermeister became a shareholder of Gin Sul on 1 July last year.

This is the first time its subsidiary, Mast-Jaegermeister UK, has looked after another brand besides its flagship herbal liqueur, Jägermeister.

Founded by Stephan Garbe in 2013, Gin Sul is distilled in Hamburg, Germany, in small batches in a 100-litre copper still using ingredients from Portugal, including lemon, gum rockrose, juniper, rosemary, coriander, rose blossoms, lavender and cinnamon.

Guy Lawrence, CEO of Mast-Jaegermeister UK, said: “[Gin Sul] is a hand-crafted, exceptionally high quality product which truly embraces its roots – remarkably in regions 3,000km apart in both Germany and Portugal.

“Gin Sul has a rich and engaging story to tell, aligning perfectly to our values and industry expertise at MJUK [Mast-Jaegermeister UK], making it a natural fit.

“We see a great deal of potential for Gin Sul as the UK market continues to embrace gin, and furthermore, consumers trade up to craft brands that deliver on quality drinking experiences.

Ireland’s Great Northern Distillery has been refused planning permission to build a whiskey warehouse facility to support its growth.,21 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/02/Great-Northern-Distillery.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/great-northern-distillery-denied-planning-approval-for-warehouses/,"Ireland’s Great Northern Distillery has been refused planning permission to build a whiskey warehouse facility to support its growth.

The Dundalk-based distillery was seeking a 10-year permission for the development of 13 whiskey warehouses in the village of Kilcurry, County Louth.

The proposal was put forward to Lough County Council in June last year but was rejected after members voted against a material contravention of the County Development Plan needed for the development to go ahead. The proposed land would need to be rezoned as industrial in order for the project to proceed.

As a result, Great Northern Distillery appealed the decision on the grounds that the facility is of “strategic economic importance to the rapidly growing Irish whiskey sector”.

The site would also “aid” the distillery’s growth and “support other small distilleries across the region who will also require maturation facilities”.

The appeal also noted “the increasing threat of Brexit”, claiming “there is a clear need to provide certainty and support to the food and beverage industry and for Ireland to be able to capitalise on potential increase in market share in the industry”.

The planning application stated that the distillery “currently produces 6.5 million litres of alcohol a year and has the potential to grow to produce 17m litres of alcohol per year”.

The proposed plans were deemed “necessary to facilitate the company’s expansion and maturation requirements”.

On 13 February, planning board An Bord Pleanála refused the development on the grounds that it would “contravene the zoning objective of the Lough County Development Plan” and would create a “discordant and obtrusive feature on the landscape at this location”. The proposal was also denied due to its location within the settlement boundary of Kilcurry.

The Spirits Business has approached Great Northern Distillery for comment.

Irish gin producer Copeland Spirits has received planning approval to build a distillery and visitor centre in Northern Ireland as part of ambitious plans to move into new categories.,21 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/02/Copeland-Spirits.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/copeland-spirits-to-open-irish-gin-and-whiskey-distillery/,"Irish gin producer Copeland Spirits has received planning approval to build a distillery and visitor centre in Northern Ireland as part of ambitious plans to move into new categories.

County Down-based company Copeland Spirits has signed a 125-year lease to build a distillery, visitor centre and events space on a 6,500-square-foot site in the harbour town of Donaghadee.

Work on the new site at 43 Manor Street, a former community centre and cinema, began in late November 2018. The site is expected to open this summer.

The £600,000 (US$784,000) investment in the project is expected to last for around six months. Upon completion, Copeland will move its operations from its current Saintfield premises to Donaghadee.

The project is part of the firm’s plans to “develop its existing gin range” and enter into new categories such as whiskey. The distillery will introduce new offerings later this year.

The company currently produces a gin range under the Copeland name, including Rhuberry Gin, Raspberry & Mint Gin, and limited edition variants Strawberry & Basil and Spiced Apple & Blackcurrant.

Copeland Spirits was established by Gareth Irvine in the summer of 2016. He successfully raised £30,000 (US$39,206) through crowdfunding in 2016, securing funds from more than 390 backers who pledged between £50 and £500 in return for bottles of gin and other Copeland rewards.

Original features from the site will be retained for the new development. The main floor of the distillery will house a 3.3-metre-high still made by German coppersmith Arnold Holstein.

The new distillery will allow Copeland to “craft its lasting brand legacy” and “become an integral part of the Donaghadee community”.

Head distiller William Stafford, who joined Copeland earlier this year, will be responsible for the day to day distilling operations and strive to “break new boundaries in the spirits industry”.

Irvine said: “Since our launch in 2016, establishing a distillery and bringing our production closer to the Copeland Islands has been our main ambition.

“We’ve worked incredibly hard over the last two years to make this a reality and now that planning has been approved and construction is well underway, it’s both rewarding and motivating to see the site being restored to its former glory as the hub of Donaghadee.

“As a brand, we are incredibly committed to our heritage and we’re proud that our investment will create new jobs and bring additional tourism to this idyllic part of Northern Ireland.

“Establishing our permanent home here in Donaghadee is the new start of this journey, and with a 125-year lease on the building we envisage being part of Northern Ireland’s future story for quite some time.

“We are incredibly excited to move into [Irish] whiskey – an industry that is targeting global sales of 12 million cases by 2020 and with growing interest from new markets for us including Russia. The category offers more than enough potential for a new player and our distillery will bring something fresh, energetic and imaginative to it.

Cannabis-based drinks reached US$86 million in the US in 2018, according to the new 2019 US CBD Drinks Report from food and drinks expert Zenith Global and US industry newsletter Beverage Digest.

Cannabis comprises two main active components: THC, which is the psychoactive part of the plant, and CBD (cannabidiol), which has reported health benefits.

CBD-based drinks have experienced a surge in popularity over the last year, and are expected to exceed US$1.4bn in the US in 2023, according to the report.

Richard Hall, Zenith Global chairman, said: “Key growth drivers for CBD drinks include loosening regulatory implementation, investment by major brewers and innovation by numerous start-ups. This has led to far greater awareness and availability.”

The report also highlighted that CBD drinks could be boosted by the removal of hemp from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act in December 2018, due to the passing of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018.

Last year saw numerous drinks companies move into the cannabis market, as recreational use of the drug was made legal in several US states and Canada.

North America’s largest drinks distributor, Southern Glazer’s Wine & Spirits, was the first to make such a move. The group created a dedicated subsidiary exclusively for the representation of cannabis in Canada, called Great North Distributors, and has already struck a deal with cannabis producer Aphria to distribute its goods nationwide.

In November last year, Casa Noble Tequila maker Constellation Brands finalised its CA$5bn (US$4bn) investment in Canadian cannabis producer Canopy Growth Corporation.

At the start of this year, US trade group the Distilled Spirits Council responded to “misinformation” about the impact of cannabis on alcohol, claiming legalisation has not affected spirits sales.

San Diego-based Cutwater Spirits was founded in 2006 under the name of Ballast Point Spirits as an offshoot of the Ballast Point Brewing Company.

The spirits firm was rebranded in 2016 as Cutwater Spirits following Constellation Brands’ US$1 billion acquisition of the company’s beer arm in 2015.

Cutwater Spirits has a portfolio of seven premium mixers, 14 spirits-based ready-to-drink (RTD) canned cocktails and 16 spirits spanning whiskey, vodka, gin and rum.

The spirits range includes Devil’s Share American Whiskey, Black Skimmer American Rye, Fugu Vodka, Old Grove Gin, Three Sheets Rum, Bali Hai Tiki Gold Rum and Opah Herbal Liqueur.

Cutwater Spirits will now join AB InBev’s ‘Beyond Beer’ range, which includes flavoured malt beverage brands Ritas and Spiked Seltzer, canned sparkling rosé Babe Rosé and energy drink brand Hiball.

The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, will allow Cutwater Spirits to “leverage Anheuser-Busch’s expertise in logistics and distribution, brand building and packaging to scale the brand even faster”.

Marina Hahn, new business co-founder, Anheuser-Busch, said: “We have tremendous respect for the brand that Cutwater Spirits has created and cultivated in just a few years and look forward to working with them to expand their premium canned cocktails to consumers across the US.”

The RTD producer currently distributes to 34 US states and has experienced “double and triple-digit growth since inception”. The Californian company operates from a 50,000-square-foot production facility.

Cutwater Spirits will continue to be managed by co-founder Yuseff Cherney, Earl Kight, and other senior-level managers.

“We’re thrilled to have found a partner that understands our vision for Cutwater Spirits and will give us with the tools and resources to grow and thrive,” said Cherney.

“We’re excited to join A-B [Anheuser-Busch] and work with the team there to bring our spirits and canned cocktails to the world.”

The acquisition is not the beer goliath’s first foray into spirits. In April last year, ZX Ventures, which is the growth and innovation unit of AB InBev, purchased Atom Group for an undisclosed sum.

The UK-headquartered group is made up of three business units: online retailer Master of Malt, spirits producer Atom Brands, and distributor Maverick Drinks, which is dedicated to ‘craft’ spirits.

The new Scotch whisky, called Tobias & the Angel, is limited to 2,634 bottles worldwide and will be available to buy next month (March).

The expression is a “culmination of almost two decades of whisky-making”.

Compass Box founder John Glaser said: “For nearly 20 years, since we created our malt blend called Eleuthera in 2002, we have held a special reverence for the two distilleries used in Tobias & the Angel: single malt whiskies from the Clynelish and Caol Ila distilleries.

“That’s when I first discovered how perfectly these single malts complement each other. When we were recently offered extremely old and special parcels of whiskies from these two distilleries, I was compelled to put them together again. There is nothing else here, just this magical pairing of single malt whiskies.”

The expression is a blend of just over half 24-year-old malt whisky from Highland distillery Clynelish, which was aged in American oak hogsheads, and peaty whisky from Islay distillery Caol Ila “of a considerably older age”.

The label design and name of the whisky takes inspiration from the Tobias and the Angel painting from the workshop of Italian Renaissance artist Andrea del Verrochio. The painting is believed to be a collaboration between several artists, most notably Leonardo da Vinci, who is thought to have painted the fish and the dog.

Compass Box contacted the National Gallery in London, where the painting resides, to seek permission to use the artwork. A royalty was paid to the museum for its use.

“We believe the whiskies we make are not just liquid in a bottle,” said Glaser. “They each represent a concept, a core idea, but at the same time they are multi-dimensional works – whisky, name, package design.

“For this whisky, the name of the biblical story Tobias and the Angel just felt right; it seemed to reflect the personality of the two whiskies in this recipe.

“Searching through the many depictions of the story over the centuries, the Verrocchio-Leonardo painting had the beauty and the gravitas we wanted for this special creation.”

Available to buy from 1 March in select specialist retailers, Tobias & the Angel is priced at RRP £450 (US$500).",Tobias and the Angel painting inspires Compass Box whisky

"Cannabis legalisation presents a “long-term risk” to the alcohol industry in the US and could be consumed in “new occasions that alcohol cannot and will not play”, according to a recent report.",22 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2018/09/Cannabis.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/legal-cannabis-long-term-risk-to-us-alcohol-sector/,"Cannabis legalisation presents a “long-term risk” to the alcohol industry in the US and could be consumed in “new occasions that alcohol cannot and will not play”, according to a recent report.

The new study, called Beverage Alcohol, Cannabis and the Changing US Consumer: What are the Real Risks and Opportunities to Consumption Behaviour?, has been published jointly by the IWSR Drinks Market Analysis and BDS Analytics. The report details the state of the current industry, alcohol and cannabis consumers and consumption occasions, trends, risks and opportunities, and growth expectations.

According to the report, the risk to alcohol “is expected to expand as cannabis acceptance and consumption grows, particularly among beer and spirits drinkers”.

It also notes that “not every dollar spent on legal cannabis is a dollar taken from alcohol”, but that drinks firms must “prepare today to meet consumers’ needs as these markets continue to mature and overlap”.

“Though not yet mainstream, cannabis adoption is certainly growing in states where it’s legal and does pose a risk to the beverage alcohol industry in the future,” said Brandy Rand, IWSR’s US president.

“It’s important that alcohol brands pay attention to their consumers, recognising that some occasions may result in a decrease in alcohol consumption in place of, or alongside, legal cannabis.”

Millennials make up 45% of ‘dualists’ – people who consumer both cannabis and alcohol – which the report notes is a “sobering statistic” for drinks firms that are “trying to capture long-term share of mind and wallet among this important demographic”.

The study comes as the US cannabis sector witnesses an explosion of growth in the last few years. Ten US states have legalised recreational cannabis use, while 34 states have approved cannabis for medicinal purposes. All but two of the remaining states permit cannabidiol (CBD) products.

The report also found that in states where cannabis is permitted, alcohol consumption “still remains higher” with twice as many adults over the legal drinking age consuming booze compared to marijuana.

The study also shows that cannabis and alcohol are “often not always appropriate for the same occasions” despite the use of marijuana starting to occur during traditional drinking occasions.

On average, ‘dualists’ are more likely to drink spirits and beer, in particular craft beer, when consuming cannabis.

Baby boomers – those born between 1946 and 1964 – are likely to be “more alcohol-exclusive”, while millennials prefer to swap between cannabis and alcohol, or just consume marijuana.

“Our research shows that up to 40% of adults 21 and over consume cannabis in states where it’s legal,” said Jessica Lukas, vice president, BDS Analytics.

“Cannabis presents substantial opportunities across consumer industries, including new occasions that alcohol cannot and will not play.

“Consumers will continue to look to cannabis products over alcohol for occasions when they are feeling creative, need to get motivated, or seeking health, medical or wellness benefits.”

The report comes just a day after a study claimed that sales of cannabis-based drinks in the US are forecast to break the billion-dollar mark by 2023.

Last month, US trade group the Distilled Spirits Council hit out at “misinformation” about the impact of cannabis on alcohol, stating that legalisation of the drug’s recreational use has not affected spirits sales.

A number of drinks firms have moved into the cannabis market in the past year.

US group Constellation Brands acquired a stake in Canadian cannabis producer Canopy Growth Corporation in 2017 and recently acquired an additional stake worth US$4 billion.

Southern Glazer’s, the largest wine and spirits distribution group in North America, created a subsidiary exclusively for the representation of cannabis products by Aphria in Canada.

Meanwhile, fellow distributor Breakthru Beverage Group formed an exclusive partnership with cannabis producer CannTrust and developed its own cannabis sales platform.

Other leading spirits firms, including Diageo, have been linked to reported cannabis deals, though they have not yet moved into the sector.",Legal cannabis ‘long-term risk’ to US alcohol sector

Prince Charles was gifted a cask of 30-year-old single malt Scotch whisky from 1988 when he visited the distillery in October last year.

The cask was presented to the prince to mark the 140th anniversary of the first royal visit to the distillery by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1848.

Prince Charles decided to bottle the whisky and donate the proceeds to his charity, The Prince’s Foundation, making it one of the oldest Lochnagar single cask bottlings to date. The bottling took place on his 70th birthday, 14 November 2018.

A total of 206 bottles were filled from the American oak hogshead cask at 52.6% abv, 184 of which were sold via The Whisky Exchange through a ballot selection process, priced at RRP £1,470 (US$1,921). The ballot sale raised £225,400 (US$294, 525).

Bottle number one was sold by Whisky.Auction, which will now sell the remaining 20 bottles of Royal Lochnagar 30 Year Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky in an online auction in March.

The auction will run from 3 to 12 March and the 20 lots will each have a starting price of £1,450.

The remaining bottle from the 206 has been placed permanently in the Diageo Archive for Royal Lochnagar.

Robert Lovie, deputy executive director of The Prince’s Foundation, said: “We are overwhelmed by the interest in His Royal Highness’s cask of Royal Lochnagar Scotch whisky and would like to give every chance for people to own a bottle.

“All proceeds raised from the sale of these bottles will be used to support the work of The Prince’s Foundation in Royal Deeside. We hope that the auction of numbers two to 20 and 206 will be equally sought after and will provide another boost to the total of £235,865 already raised by the sale of the cask to support The Prince’s Foundation’s commitment to helping Ballater regain its footing and train a new generation of hospitality professionals.”","Bottle one of Prince Charles’s whisky sells for £9,100"

Online retailer Master of Malt has warned of a “potential breach” of customer data after its email marketing provider was hacked.,1 March 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/03/Master-of-Malt.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/03/master-of-malt-investigates-potential-data-hack/,"Online retailer Master of Malt has warned of a “potential breach” of customer data after its email marketing provider was hacked.

In a letter to customers, Master of Malt managing director Tom McGuinness said some of its customer names and email addresses may have been accessed overnight via its Mailchimp account, which the company uses to manage its email list.

McGuinness reassured customers that “no other personal data of any sort has been compromised”, and said the company suspended its access to Mailchimp as soon as it became aware of the potential breach.

“The practical impact of this is likely to be that you receive a few more spam emails than you usually do,” said McGuinness. “For almost everyone, especially those using modern email systems like Gmail, Yahoo, and Office 365, those spam emails are likely to just end up in your spam folder and never see the light of day.

“Obviously that doesn’t make this OK – it’s not OK and we’re extremely upset about it – but I hope the additional context is helpful.”

Master of Malt is “investigating to assess how many email addresses have in fact been accessed”.

The retailer has so far discovered two types of spam that have been sent: one purporting to be from Mailchimp requesting billing details to be updated, and another claiming to be from the UK government regarding tax refunds.

“Both of these are very convincing, so please do be careful, and don’t click any links in any email unless you’re sure they are valid. It’s very easy to get caught out,” continued McGuinness.

“I’m incredibly sorry that this has happened, and for the stress and inconvenience it will no doubt have caused.”

"The number of pubs, bars and nightclubs with 24-hour alcohol licences in England and Wales has dropped by 19% over the last five years as millennials move away from excessive alcohol consumption.",4 March 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/03/nightclub.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/03/late-night-alcohol-licenses-fall-19-in-five-years/,"The number of pubs, bars and nightclubs with 24-hour alcohol licences in England and Wales has dropped by 19% over the last five years as millennials move away from excessive alcohol consumption.

According to ONS data on alcohol and late-night refreshment licensing cited by UK-based commercial law firm EMW, the number of venues with a 24-hour alcohol license fell to 742 last year, down from 919 in 2013.

EMW said there was “low demand” for venues with 24-hour alcohol licences. This was attributed to the costs of staying open longer for some businesses outweighing the profits from additional sales.

Another major factor was the “high level of insolvencies” in the bar and pub industry as well as the “changing attitudes” towards alcohol consumption from younger people.

Research from BMC Public Health showed that 29% of 16- to 24-year-olds were non-drinkers in 2015, up from 18% in 2005.

EMW also noted that low wage growth and Brexit uncertainty have “dampened consumer spending” in the late-night industry, signalling a shift towards buying booze from supermarkets.

The number of supermarkets and stores with 24-hour alcohol licences in England and Wales has increased 40% over the last five years to 2,680 in 2018, up from 1,909 in 2013.

As a result of these factors, together with high beer duty and business rates, a large number of pubs and bars have closed in recent years, which is likely to contribute to the fall in 24-hour licences, the EMW said.

Marco Mauro, legal director at EMW said: “24-hour alcohol licences were expected to boost the night-time economy but this has simply not happened.

“Continued cultural changes in the way people interact and socialise, such as through dating apps, and the rise of Netflix, has created less demand for pubs, bars and nightclubs.

“Increasingly many individuals are also now not going out until much later in the evening, and, as a result, they can often spend less on drinks at the pubs.”

“For most venues the potential extra revenue from staying open 24 hours is still not enough to make those businesses sustainable operations, resulting in many pubs and bars having to close their doors.

“Also, the expensive requirement for door supervisors in some local authorities has acted as a significant burden for some businesses.”

“Without a more supportive attitude from local and central government, we could see a further decline in this part of the late-night economy.”

The rate of drinks-led pub and bar closures in Britain has “substantially slowed” over the last 12 months due to the popularity of ‘craft’ spirits and cocktails, according to new research.",Late-night alcohol licences fall 19% in five years

Distell’s sales hit R14,4 billion (US$1bn) in the six months to 31 December 2018. The group delivered “solid” growth across all three categories it operates in – spirits, wine and RTDs (ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages) – and recorded gains for 12 out of 15 of its largest brands.

The group’s whisky portfolio, which includes Bunnahabhain single malt Scotch and the Bain’s South African blend, experienced double-digit volume and value gains.

Amarula liqueur was boosted by “select international growth”, while Distell’s brandy stable struggled with cross-category competition and recorded flat sales.

In South Africa, total sales volumes fell by 2.1% due to “declining disposable income which impacted peak-season sales”. However, pricing changes “had a positive impact on revenue”.

Other African markets outside of South Africa delivered “exceptional” comparable revenue growth of 21.1%.

International revenues increased by 3.7% “as momentum built on a narrower and more profitable portfolio”.

“We are pleased with the momentum and continued resilience of our business,” said Richard Rushton, CEO of Distell Group. “Our results reflect the efficiency initiatives aimed at driving consistent market place execution and enhancing margins.

“I’m particularly encouraged with the stellar performance of our Africa operations at a time when we are increasing investments in route-to-market capability and local production.”

Rushton added that Distell is exploring “complementary M&A opportunities” to boost its international business.

“Looking ahead, we expect the current tough domestic environment to persist and economic growth to remain lacklustre,” he said. “We are, however, confident that our consumer-centric approach and diversified portfolio of brands will enable us to capture growth opportunities.”

Distell is currently embarking on a £10.5 million (US$13.97m) upgrade of its Islay distillery Bunnahabhain (see artist’s impression below).

Leading trade show Vinexpo will shine a light on spirits with a brand new concept at its inaugural Paris event on 13-15 January 2020.,25 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/02/Vinexpo-Be-Spirits.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/vinexpo-to-launch-new-spirits-event-at-paris-show/,"Leading trade show Vinexpo will shine a light on spirits with a brand new concept at its inaugural Paris event on 13-15 January 2020.

Dedicated to the rich world of distilled beverages, Be Spirits is described as a “show within a show” that will provide a “360-degree vision” of the international bar scene. It will showcase brands of all sizes and styles, offering a one-stop-shop for influential buyers, bartenders, journalists and key opinion leaders to immerse themselves in the latest products and trends shaping the industry.

Christophe Navarre, chairman of Vinexpo, says Be Spirits is indicative of the show’s increasing focus on spirits. “The global spirits market is growing, hence a specific demand from spirits brands,” he says. “More specifically the latest Vinexpo/IWSR Report shows that the premium-plus segments of almost all major categories are expected to grow in the coming years. This will add an extra 56 million nine-litre cases to the premium-plus spirits market from 2017 to 2022.

“Besides, the spirits industry is a very innovative sector on all levels, and we want to stay close to the industry. Our strategy for Vinexpo is to create additional events and animations within the exhibition, and this new Be Spirits event at Vinexpo Paris will give us the opportunity to develop fully the specific codes of the world of spirits.”

Be Spirits will be hosted in a dedicated area divided into three sections: Brand Experience, Spirit P.O.D, and Education.

Brand Experience is described as the “ultimate bar area” where exhibitors will be able to bring their own bartenders to showcase their products to guests in a natural environment. Spirit P.O.D will be an exhibition area designed to facilitate business appointments, while Education will be a learning and networking zone where brands can host tastings, masterclasses and launch events.

Be Spirits will host three main conferences every day related to issues impacting the international bar trade, such as the art of blending and how to revive the popularity of a category.

Guests can also experience the Infinite Bar, which, at 65-metres-long, is the longest bar in the world. Exhibitors will be able to occupy two-metres of the bar and show guests how their products can be used in mixed drinks. Each brand will be associated with a Parisian mixologist behind the bar, who will highlight the product’s uses during the evening.

The Lab feature, meanwhile, will allow start-up brands to present their innovations. Navarre explains: “The Lab will provide solutions with cutting-edge technology within one place. For example, a technology to create special ice cubes, or a cocktail machine able to create specific cocktails in an instant.”

Those interested in exhibiting their products at Be Spirits can do so in a number of ways: by building their own stand; occupying a ‘spirit pod’, which is ready-made; or via the Infinite Bar.

Be Spirits will aim to become “a key event for all stakeholders from the spirits and bar sectors”, and it may extend its reach beyond Paris. According to Navarre, the concept has potential to be adapted for Vinexpo’s other international exhibitions. The inaugural event will host around 30% of Vinexpo Paris’s exhibitors, with the remaining 70% hailing from the wine world.

“In just three days, the participating spirits stakeholders will meet all the key players from the bartending world, not mentioning being exposed to a significant media attention,” concludes Navarre. “It will be good value for money.”

Vinexpo Paris will take place at the Paris Convention Centre on 13-15 January 2020. For more information, visit www.vinexpoparis.com.",Vinexpo to launch new spirits event in Paris
"The rate of drinks-led pub and bar closures in Britain has “substantially slowed” over the last 12 months due to the popularity of ‘craft’ spirits and cocktails, according to new research.",26 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2018/12/Alcohol-cocktails-celebration-WEB-1.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/craft-spirits-help-slow-britains-bar-closures-rate/,"The rate of drinks-led pub and bar closures in Britain has “substantially slowed” over the last 12 months due to the popularity of ‘craft’ spirits and cocktails, according to new research.

The latest Market Growth Monitor report from data and research consultancy CGA and global consulting firm Alix Partners revealed that drinks-led pubs – venues that generate the majority of sales from drinks – and bar closures averaged 3.6 a day in the last five years, but lessened in the last 12 months to 2.2 a day.

The study noted the slower pace follows a “strong 2018” for pubs and bars, due to Britain’s unusually hot summer, the FIFA World Cup and the rising popularity of artisanal spirits, cocktails and craft beer.

The quarterly Market Growth Monitor report provides data on restaurant, pub, and bar openings and closures.

CGA vice president Peter Martin said: “The last decade has seen a relentless decline in Britain’s number of pubs and bars, but there are welcome signs that the clear-out of unsustainable sites is starting to ease.

“With consumers’ drinking trends working in the sector’s favour, and food-led pub operators facing the same challenges as managed restaurants, the outlook for drinkers’ pubs is better than it has been for a long time.”

Alix Partners managing director Graeme Smith added that the “positive outlook” for drinking establishments is due to “buoyant” mergers and acquisitions in the industry.

Partners said: “Trade and private equity buyers are turning their gaze to pub and bar assets. This reflects not only the saturation of certain parts of the restaurant market but also the combination of reduced supply and the continued rise of quality wet-led pub and bar operators. These factors have been driving strong performance in a challenging environment.”

The report also added that Britain had 5,780 managed restaurants in December 2018 – 27.3% or 1,241 more than five years ago.

However, managed restaurants “appear to have peaked” as numbers fell by 0.1% from December 2017. The majority of the decline was attributed to casual dining brands.

The declining fortunes of restaurants have hit headlines in the past year, with chains such as Byron, Jamie’s Italian and Prezzo closing sites in order to stay afloat.",‘Craft’ spirits help slow Britain’s bar closures rate

The distillery will also launch the first two expressions from its new Connoisseur Collection – a 17-year-old single malt Irish whiskey finished in rare virgin Japanese mizunara oak and a 25-year-old single malt aged in Bourbon and oloroso Sherry barrels and finished in virgin Irish oak.

Gary McLoughlin, co-founder and marketing director said: “Last year we launched two exceptional whiskeys along with a distinctive new bottle design across our full range.

“This coupled with our continued commitment and focus on the US saw us significantly outperform category growth trends.

“Our expansion into three key Irish whiskey markets – Texas, Florida and California – and our upcoming new whiskey and gin launches will fuel our continued growth in 2019.”

Next month Glendalough will launch its “biggest” St Patrick’s Day (17 March) campaign to date, called Made from Ireland. The marketing push will include trade and consumer on- and off-premise activations, social media and PR.

A trio of consumer groups has criticised the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) over its proposal to “modernise” alcohol labels without making nutritional information mandatory.,25 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2018/11/spirits-bottles.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/concerns-over-plans-to-modernise-alcohol-labels/,"A trio of consumer groups has criticised the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) over its proposal to “modernise” alcohol labels without making nutritional information mandatory.

The Center for Science in the Public Interest, Consumer Federation of America, and National Consumers League have written a letter to US Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin slating the TTB for not requiring alcoholic beverage bottles to include information about alcohol content, serving size, calories, ingredients and allergen information.

The trio of groups petitioned the TTB in 2003, calling for this information to be a legal requirement on alcohol labels.

The TTB issued proposed rules to require compulsory allergen labelling in 2006 and serving information in 2007 – but neither has been finalised as of yet.

In the letter, the groups said: “Not only do consumers want this information, the TTB needs it to fulfil its statutory obligation under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA) of 1935, which directs the TTB to ensure that alcohol labelling and advertising ‘provide the consumer with adequate information as to the identity and quality of the products’.”

The letter continued: “While the TTB may believe that the issues are complex, the agency has now had over a decade to consider them, and rule makings to provide this key information that are already well under way. These rules should be prioritised under any effort to modernise alcohol labelling.

“The TTB cannot and should not set aside the most pressing consumer issues on its docket. We urge you to instruct the TTB to withdraw the proposed rule and to issue a new proposal providing a mandatory, standardised declaration covering alcohol content by percentage and amount, serving size, calories, ingredients, allergen information and other information relevant to consumers.”

The Spirits Business has contacted the TTB for comment.",Concerns over plans to ‘modernise’ alcohol labels
South African drinks group Distell has put the wheels in motion on a £10.5 million (US$13.97m) upgrade of Islay distillery Bunnahabhain.,27 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/02/Bunnahabhain-distillery-renovation.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/bunnahabhain-begins-10-5m-upgrade/,"South African drinks group Distell has put the wheels in motion on a £10.5 million (US$13.97m) upgrade of Islay distillery Bunnahabhain.

Plans for the upgrade were first revealed in 2017, with Derek Scott, brand director for malts at Distell, confessing that historically Bunnahabhain has been “under invested in”.

The three-year refurbishment programme aims to create a new ‘brand home’ for the distillery, located at the most northerly point of the island.

The new visitor centre will include a café and retail space, and will be located on the coast, with views of Bunnahabhain Bay and the Sound of Islay (a narrow strait between the islands of Islay and Jura).

Distell aims to have the visitor centre open to members of the public by 2020.

While several of the Scotch whisky distillery’s original buildings will be restored, others will be removed and relocated to create more space. It is hoped this will allow better operational flow across the site and give an improved experience for visitors.

Four warehouse buildings have already been demolished, and work has commenced to upgrade the existing pumphouse.

More than 99% of the materials processed during the demolition have been recycled, with the majority set aside to be reused at the distillery.

Additional improvements will include building a new filling store, refurbishing the production building, and also the six cottages alongside the distillery, which will be used as holiday accommodation.

Scott said: “Our investment programme here at Bunnahabhain is about improving the operational side of our distillery for the long-term future.

“The plans aim to make the navigation of the site much easier for the visitor and to, in simple terms, declutter it.

“This will ensure the buildings are more efficient from a storage point of view and located in better suited, more accessible locations to the production buildings.

“Furthermore, we are committed to reducing the environmental impact of the works. The whisky industry is starting to be more environmentally aware and our achievement of recycling over 99% of materials shows, with a little bit of extra effort, it is remarkable what we can achieve.”",Bunnahabhain begins £10.5m upgrade

Last year, Diageo increased its stake in Chinese spirits producer Sichuan Shuijingfang Company from 39.71% to 60%.

Now, through its Grand Metropolitan International Holdings subsidiary, the UK firm has approached the board of the Chinese group with a proposal to increase its ownership to 70%, at RMB45.00 (US$6.74) per share.

Sichuan Shuijingfang Company is a Shanghai Stock Exchange-listed white spirits maker. Its principal brand is super-premium baijiu Shui Jing Fang.

After moving under Diageo’s control in 2011, Shui Jing Fang experienced a tumultuous time in light of the Chinese government’s anti-corruption drive, which obliterated China’s high-end spirits market.

Diageo initiated a write of the value of Shui Jing Fang in 2014, but the brand has since returned to buoyancy. In the first half of Diageo’s 2019 fiscal year, organic sales for the group’s Chinese white spirits portfolio, led by Shui Jing Fang, increased by 22%.

Baijiu continues to dominate the ranks of the world’s most valuable spirits. In Brand Finance’s most recent Spirits 50 report, the world’s top 10 most valuable spirits brands included five Chinese white spirits.

In the year ending 31 December 2018, net sales rose to MXN$28,158 million pesos (US$1,468.2m). Volume sales also rose 3.8% over the year, reaching 21.3m nine-litre cases.

Becle reported “strong” volume and net sales growth during its final quarter of the year, driven by double-digit growth in the US and Canada, and the rest of the world regions, while Mexico was “stable”.

Net sales in the US and Canada increased 6.2% in 2018 compared to the previous year, attributed to both volume growth and a favourable sales mix.

In Mexico, net sales rose 12.6% on a pro forma IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standard) 15 basis compared to the year before, which was due to volume growth and higher average net selling prices per case as a result of favourable sales mix and price increases.

Looking to the rest of the world region, net sales grew 21.4%, also due to volume growth and higher sales mix of premium spirit brands.

In terms of individual brands, Jose Cuervo Tequila represented 34.1% of total net sales for 2018, with sales up 1% compared to 2017.

Becle’s other Tequila brands, representing 23.3% of total net sales, saw an 11.1% increase on the previous year.

The business’s other spirits brands – including Irish whiskey Bushmills – reported net sales growth of 26.9% over the course of the year, and represented 23.4% of total net sales.

Net sales of ready-to-drink (RTDs) brands accounted for 8.2% of total net sales, and grew 6.2%.

Commenting on the results, Becle management said in a statement: “Becle finished 2018 with strong volume and net sales growth during the fourth quarter.

“We continued to see strong depletion trends in the US and Canada for the third consecutive quarter while tightly managing distributor Tequila inventories across our geographies.

“Growth was once again led by our premiumisation trend toward super-premium Tequilas across all regions.

“The company remains well positioned in the global spirits industry, with significant capital and low debt leverage to execute our long-term growth strategy.”

"BrewDog’s spirits arm is planning to release a new brand of vodka and gin later this year, and is moving closer to launching its “disruptive” whisky.",27 February 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/02/Brewdog-Distilling.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/02/brewdog-md-whisky-is-ripe-for-disruption/,"BrewDog’s spirits arm is planning to release a new brand of vodka and gin later this year, and is moving closer to launching its “disruptive” whisky.

The Scottish brewer moved into spirits in 2015 with the launch of its Lone Wolf range, produced at a distillery built inside its Ellon brewhouse, where every stage of production is carried out.

BrewDog’s Lone Wolf spirits operation has been renamed BrewDog Distilling under new managing director David Gates, who joined the firm from Diageo at the end of last year.

Speaking to The Spirits Business, Gates said the change would allow BrewDog’s spirits portfolio to capitalise on the “brand equity” of its famous beers.

“When BrewDog was founded, it had a first-mover advantage in craft beer, which in the UK was a relatively underdeveloped marketplace,” he said.

“The craft spirits market is congested now, and you might argue we are late to the party. From a spirits perspective, to not leverage that brand equity feels like a missed opportunity.”

BrewDog’s distillery is also named Lone Wolf, which Gates claimed might change to create a “more synergistic” relationship with BrewDog beer. The Lone Wolf brand will be renamed, and will be joined by a number of other brands under the BrewDog Distilling umbrella.

This year BrewDog Distilling is set to launch an entirely new brand of vodka and gin, move into rum, and embark on a series of “collaborative” projects. The team is also working to launch its first Ellon-distilled whisky, following the 2016 debut of Uncle Duke’s, made using sourced liquid.

According to Gates, whisky is the spirits category that is “most ripe for disruption” and will therefore be BrewDog Distilling’s main focus. The firm is aiming to “make Scotland fall back in love with its national spirit”.

Gates added: “There’s so much old fashioned snobbery that’s attached to Scotch whisky – actually bringing some of the BrewDog punk attitude is exactly what’s needed.

“When you look at Scotch in the 1950s and 1960s, it was actually a really ballsy category, and it had a point of view; it wasn’t all this black tie status nonsense. We need to get a bit more grit.

“The BrewDog business is gritty, it’s down to earth, it’s democratic. Scotch at its worst can be pompous, aloof – it can be quite unapproachable and snobby.”

According to Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, the vodka was being transported in a container on the ship Nebula, operated by Chinese shipping company Cosco.

The container was thought to be travelling from Russia to China via the Netherlands and Belgium, but officials became suspicious of its contents and final destination after it left Antwerp.

Upon its arrival in Rotterdam, officials attempted to offload the container, which had been hidden underneath the fuselage of an aeroplane.

Once offloaded, port authorities discovered the container was filled with 90,000 bottles of Russian vodka – which they believe was destined for North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong Un.

The contents of the container are currently undergoing tests to discover its origins and final destination, but initial lab tests have so far only confirmed the contents are vodka.

Arno Kooij, director of risk management for the Customs Administration, told Algemeen Dagblad: “We get the information on each incoming and outgoing container on a ship a few days ahead. Our computer systems then examine the data. If, for example, something strange happens, if an unusual route has been taken, or if we have a lead, the computer will select the container for an inspection.

“We do not want to release more information than necessary about our control strategy. But what I can tell you is that based on the information available, we suspected that this particular container was subject to the sanctions regime for North Korea.

“Every day, we send shipments for a variety of reasons. But this particular shipment – underneath a fuselage – is one that I will not easily forget.”

The decision to unload the container in Rotterdam was made by Sigrid Kaag, the Dutch minister for foreign trade, who told Algemeen Dagblad the trade sanctions in place around North Korea also cover the import of luxury goods, “so Customs was completely justified in eventually unloading that container”.",Dutch seize 90k vodka bottles thought to be for North Korea

“My success can be traced from the lessons I learned growing up, the values of loyalty and hard work. Proper No. Twelve is who I am.

The 1940s bottle of Mackie’s Ancient Brand Scotch Whisky is being sold online through whiskyauctioneer.com, the auction will run from 22 February until 4 March.

This bottle of Mackie’s was imported to the US market by Browne Vintners Company in New York. The amount of Malt Mill whisky in the blend is unknown, but the bottle is said to offer a “unique opportunity to potentially own whisky from the legendary lost Islay distillery”.

Joe Wilson, whisky content expert at Whisky Auctioneer, said: “We are excited to feature this incredibly special bottle in our current auction. Almost all the whisky produced at Malt Mill went into blends, namely White Horse and Mackie’s, with examples exceptionally rare and highly prized. We expect to see a huge amount of interest in this vintage gem from whisky collectors across the world.”

Mackie’s Ancient Brand Scotch Whisky takes its name from Sir Peter Mackie, once proprietor of the Lagavulin distillery in Islay, and agent for neighbour distillery Laphroaig. After losing the contract for Laphroaig, Mackie built an exact replica of the distillery on the grounds of Lagavulin, designed to precisely replicate the output of Laphroaig – this distillery was Malt Mill.

Spirit from the Malt Mill distillery has been described as “the unicorn of drams” and the legend of the distillery was bolstered further by the 2012 Ken Loach film, The Angels’ Share, where a single fictitious cask of Malt Mill played a starring role.

The sixth edition of the Code of Practice on the Naming, Packaging and Promotion of Alcoholic Drinks comes following a wide consultation to ensure the rules remain up to date and relevant. It will come into effect in September 2019.

One of the key changes is the inclusion of a rule to prevent offensive marketing, which stresses producers must take care when referencing race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability and age on packaging or promotional materials.

The updated code also includes a new unit-based definition for immoderate consumption in response to the change in weekly drinking guidelines set by the chief medical officer (CMO). Single-serve products and non-resealable beverages must not contain more than four units of alcohol, according to the updated CMO guidelines.

However, the code adds that “mitigating factors” for products containing up to six units will be taken into consideration, which can include a product’s premium status, price point and brand message.

Further changes are also outlined, such as ensuring a product does not suggest any association with illegal behaviour and forbidding “association with bravado or violent, aggressive, dangerous or anti-social behaviour”.

The new code also references that products should not claim to have mind-altering qualities or suggest that it will change mood or behaviour, which includes any suggestions that a product has therapeutic qualities or can enhance mental or physical capabilities.

John Timothy, chief executive of the Portman Group, said: “In completing this review we have been conscious throughout of the need to drive up standards and provide better protection for consumers, while at the same time supporting producers to innovate and bring forward new and exciting brands and products.

“Our latest code update reflects changes to the industry and wider society and strikes the right balance between protection and creative freedom.

“I am particularly pleased that we have been able to establish a common sense approach to defining immoderate consumption, setting a unit-based threshold but providing flexibility too for the Independent Complaints Panel to consider the product in its wider context.”",Portman Group unveils sixth Code of Practice

Drinkers in West Virginia are now able to buy spirits seven days a week after a Prohibition-era ban on Sunday sales was lifted.,5 March 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/03/Liquor-Store-Sign.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/03/west-virginia-strikes-down-sunday-spirits-sales-ban/,"Drinkers in West Virginia are now able to buy spirits seven days a week after a Prohibition-era ban on Sunday sales was lifted.

From last Sunday (3 March), West Virginians can buy spirits after 1pm on Sundays, except Easter and Christmas, under a new law signed by governor Jim Justice.

Previously, consumers in West Virginia were only allowed to buy beer and wine at retail stores on Sundays.

Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, said: “More and more states are rolling back these outdated Sunday sales bans to modernise their alcohol laws and increase consumer convenience.

Since 2002, 21 states have passed Sunday spirits sales legislation bringing the total to 43 states across the country. In 2018, Indiana and Tennessee passed Sunday sales laws, and Virginia lawmakers have recently ruled that Sunday hours will be permitted from 10am, rather than midday.

According to a Distilled Spirits Council economic analysis, Sunday liquor sales could generate more than US$1 million in new state revenue if all stores open that are eligible under the law.",West Virginia strikes down Sunday spirits sales ban

Gordon & MacPhail announced plans to construct a distillery in Craggan, near Grantown-on-Spey, last year.

Once constructed, the site will initially produce 375,000 litres of spirit per year, although the distillery will be capable of producing two million litres of alcohol each year.

The site, which has been designed to take advantage of its views across the River Spey, has a circular design to disguise much of the day-to-day workings of the distillery.

It’s proposed construction would utilise a ‘living roof’ to help the building blend into the surroundings.

Ewen Mackintosh, Gordon & MacPhail’s managing director, said: “People are saying how excited they are to see a distillery being proposed for the area as they believe it has the potential to support Grantown-on-Spey as a destination and encourage visitors to stay longer in the town.”

Gordon & MacPhail has worked with architects at NORR to create the designs for the distillery, which will be the first new build Scotch malt whisky distillery to be established in Cairngorms National Park.

Stuart Urquhart, Gordon & MacPhail operations director, said: “We are a long-standing family-owned business with strong roots and commitment to the north of Scotland. Building and operating our second distillery is part of our generational plan to grow a long-term sustainable business, whilst continuing to be part of the fabric of the local community.”

The new distillery will be the company’s second, and follows its purchase and refurbishment of the Benromach Distillery.",Gordon & MacPhail unveils Cairngorms distillery plans

Gross net profit for the year increased by 7.5% organically and 1.6% reportedly to €1.02bn (US$1.15bn).

Campari Group’s global priority brands increased by 8.9% organically, led by Aperol which grew by 28.1%.

Aperol was driven by “continued solid growth” in its core markets – Italy, Germany, Austria and Switzerland – and “strong double-digit growth” in high potential and seeding markets including the US, the UK, Spain, France, global travel retail (GTR), Australia, Eastern European and Scandinavian markets, Canada, Brazil, Argentina and Chile.

Campari grew by 5.1% organically driven by the Italian market and double-digit growth in the US, Germany, the UK, Russia, Nigeria, Canada and Jamaica.

Skyy vodka was the only global priority brand to decline, falling by 8.1% due to “weakness” in the US following destocking and “continued strong competitive pressure and reduced innovations in infusions”.

Wild Turkey Bourbon and Wild Turkey Honey grew by 7%, driven by the US, Australia and Japan.

Grand Marnier liqueur increased by 5.3%, profiting from a new marketing campaign and a “redefined drinking strategy”.

New South Wales-based Ironbark Distillery produces vodka, gin, rum and moonshine using local mountain spring water. The cost of the acquisition has not been disclosed.

As part of the deal, the distillery’s leading brand Ironbark Dry Gin will enter the UK, US and China – marking the first time the gin is exported outside of Australia.

Halewood’s new Australian arm, Halewood Australia, will import and market its British products including Whitley Neill gin, JJ Whitley gin, Dead Man’s Fingers rum, Aber Falls spirits, and the Peaky Blinder spirits range.

Stewart Hainsworth, CEO of Halewood Wines & Spirits, said: “The formation of the Halewood Australia business is an exciting step for us internationally and will allow us to introduce our wider portfolio. We look forward to successfully developing the Ironbark brand globally.”

Ironbark is aiming to triple production capacity of its gin, rum and whisky.

Reg Papps, master distiller and director of Ironbark, said: “When you create a brand you always dream that it will be carried on for generations.

“To have a business partner like Halewood Australia behind Ironbark gives us the opportunity to see the business grow to its full potential and be carried forward for many generations.”

In the company’s third quarter ending 31 January 2019, reported operating income grew 4% to US$230m compared to the same period in the previous financial year.

For the first nine months of fiscal 2019, the company’s reported net sales increased by 3% to US$2.580 billion and reported operating income increased 2% year to date to US$916m.

CEO Lawson Whiting said: “Our portfolio of premium spirits brands delivered solid rates of sustained sales growth, led by the strength of our Bourbon and Tequila brands, as well as the international expansion of the Jack Daniel’s trademark.

“We remain on track to deliver another strong year of results as cost discipline helped offset some of the large burden we are absorbing due to the retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey.

“The growth opportunity for our brand portfolio remains significant, and our teams around the world are executing on our long-term growth strategy.”

The US has found itself embroiled in numerous trade wars in 2018, including with Canada, the EU and China. It comes after US president Donald Trump introduced a 25% import duty on steel and 10% on aluminium.

As such, nations including Canada and China retaliated with their own tariffs, targeting US goods such as American whiskey.

In June last year, Brown-Forman confirmed prices of its American whiskey and Bourbon brands would be raised as a direct result of the tariffs – up 10% in EU markets where the company owns distribution.

In the US, underlying net sales for the year to date grew 4% boosted by the double-digit growth of Bourbon brands Woodford Reserve and Old Forester.

Net sales in the company’s developed international markets increased by 3% driven mainly by volume gains.

Germany and Australia delivered “very strong” net sales growth of 13% and 7%, respectively.

The UK and France had “modest” results, up 3% and 1%, respectively. Canada declined by 5% due to a change in Brown-Forman’s selling and marketing structure.

The Mexican market “remained the largest growth driver”, up by 15%, fuelled by “strong gains” across the group’s Tequila range.

Poland grew by 1% as “double-digit gains for Jack Daniel’s were largely offset by soft results for Finlandia”. Travel retail provided “solid” results, up by 6%.

The Jack Daniel’s family of brands grew by 4% globally and was “negatively impacted by approximately one percentage point due to tariff-related lower net prices”.

The company’s portfolio of super- and ultra-premium American whiskey brands – including Woodford Reserve, Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel and Gentleman Jack – delivered a growth of 24% due to “favourable” category trends.

Woodford Reserve increased by 24% as it enjoyed “out-sized growth as the leader in the super-premium Bourbon category”. Old Forester also grew by double digits.

El Jimador Tequila rose by 15%, boosted by volume growth and higher prices in the US as well as “strong takeaway trends in Mexico after repositioning the brand in the premium space over the last few years”.

Herradura Tequila was up by 14% with double-digit gains in the US and Mexico driven by “continued consumer demand” for Herradura Ultra.

Finlandia vodka declined by 7% due to Poland’s “competitive retail environment for vodka” and the “tough prior year comparison” when Brown-Forman appointed a new distributor in Russia.

Underlying advertising spend increased 3% year-to-date as the firm made investments across the brand portfolio, including flagship brand Jack Daniel’s, the first year of the Woodford Reserve Kentucky Derby sponsorship, and the opening of the Old Forester distillery last year.

Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2019, the company said “recently enacted retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey have created additional uncertainty around the company’s near-term outlook, making it difficult to accurately predict future results”.

Upon the assumption that tariffs remain in place for the full fiscal year, Brown-Forman expects an underlying net sales growth of 6%-7% and an operating income growth of between 4%-6%.",Bourbon and Tequila boost Brown-Forman Q3 sales

Whisky was a new entrant to the KFLII, reaching the top spot. It was followed by coins, wine and art. Over the last 10 years, rare whisky has witnessed a 580% increase in value.

The growth has been partially attributed to the the Asian market, as sales of Scotch whisky to India, China and Singapore rose by 44%, 35% and 24%, respectively, in the first half of 2018, according to the Scotch Whisky Association. Single malts now account for 28% of the value of all Scotch exports.

Published in the annual Wealth Report 2019, The Knight Frank Rare Whisky 100 Index (KFRW100) was compiled by analyst Rare Whisky 101 and contains 100 bottles of the world’s most desirable rare Scotch whisky and tracks UK auction prices.

Last year’s “most significant” sale was a bottle of 1926 Macallan featuring a hand-painted design by Irish artist Michael Dillon that broke the world record for the most expensive whisky after fetching £1.2 million (US$1.5m) at an auction in November.

Andrew Shirley, editor of The Wealth Report and the KFLII, said: “The stunning price growth of rare single malt whiskies shows that the appetite for new ‘alternative’ asset classes remains strong among high-net-worth investors.”

Andy Simpson, co-founder of Rare Whisky 101, added: “While rare whisky remains a somewhat fledgling asset class compared to some other passion investments, the market for rare and vintage bottles has witnessed extraordinary growth over the past 10 years, both in terms of the volume of whisky being traded and the value of that whisky.”

Looking ahead to 2019, Simpson said: “We see prices continuing to harden for the right bottles from the right distilleries, as well as increased interest in more affordable bottles from the second tier. But certain pockets could see a correction.

“To some extent we saw that with The Macallan 18-year-old index, which fell by 2.9% in 2018. This followed a 142% increase in 2016 and a further 35% increase in 2017, so perhaps an adjustment was to be expected.

“From a risk perspective, we believe the incidence of fakes can only increase while prices are so high and demand so robust.”",Rare whisky tops luxury investment index

Only 40 bottles of The Macallan 1926 were released in 1986 following a 60-year maturation period in Sherry casks, each with a £20,000 price tag.

Out of the 40, 12 bottles were given to British pop artist Sir Peter Blake to design, with another 12 handed to artist Valerio Adami, and one bottle hand-painted by Irish artist Michael Dillon – which became the first whisky to sell for more than £1 million last year.

Martin Green, Bonhams whisky specialist in Edinburgh, said: “Only 12 bottles of The Macallan 60-year-old 1926 were issued with the label designed by Sir Peter Blake, who is known throughout the world for co-creating the cover for the Beatles 1967 album Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.

“It is very exciting to have sold one of these incredibly rare bottles here in Scotland for such a very high price.”

The highest price paid for a bottle from the Blake series happened in May 2018 when a bottle was bought for £751,703 (US$970,900) at a Bonhams auction in Hong Kong.

Other highlights from the most recent Bonhams sale in Edinburgh include a 50-year-old Dalmore 1926, which beat its £15,000-£20,000 (US$19,700-US$26,275) estimate with a closing sale of £27,563 (US$36,213).

According to a statement from emergency service Nelson County Emergency Management, crews were on the scene at the incident on the morning of 5 March.

Two unnamed individuals were injured in the incident and taken to Flaget Memorial Hospital in Bardstown with “non-life-threatening injuries”. Both parties have been treated and released, the statement said.

The statement read: “When first responders arrived on scene they found that a mash tank at the distillery had failed. Another tank was punctured and a pipe on a third tank damaged causing the two tanks to leak.

“The leaking fluids flowed into a nearby holding basin. When that basin began to overflow, the liquid then started moving toward a nearby stream.

“Workers constructed berms to protect the stream. A clean up crew contracted by Barton 1792 was on site and additional resources from their company were also responding.”

Jeff Bezos, founder of e-commerce giant Amazon, was named the world’s richest man by Forbes, with a wealth of US$131 billion.

The chairman and CEO of LVMH, Bernard Arnault, was placed fourth on the list, with a net worth of US$76bn. LVMH owns the Moët Hennessy drinks subsidiary, which includes brands such as Glenmorangie Scotch and Belvedere vodka.

However, a significant portion of Arnault’s wealth will come from his luxury clothing and cosmetics chains, including Luis Vuitton and Sephora.

Juan Francisco Beckmann Vidal, chairman of Jose Cuervo, is the wealthiest billionaire whose main business is spirits, placed at #452 on the list. The tycoon, who owns a 70% stake in his Tequila company, has a net worth of US$4.3bn according to Forbes. His son, Juan Domingo Beckmann Legorreta, is CEO of Jose Cuervo.

The Tequila company, which has been owned by the same family for 11 generations, launched its initial public offering in 2017 and raised US$900 million.

Bert ‘Tito’ Beveridge built his enormously successful vodka brand, Tito’s Handmade Vodka, from the ground up, and is now the 504th wealthiest billionaire in the world, with a net worth of US$4bn.

Tito’s has managed to overcome controversy surrounding its use of the term ‘handmade’ to become one of the fastest-growing spirits brands in the US.

According to Forbes, the brand sold 63m bottles in 2017, when it also entered its 100th market. Tito’s donates 100% of proceeds from its online store to charity.

Jean-Pierre Cayard, president of La Martiniquaise, maker of Poliakov vodka and Glen Moray Scotch, was placed #691 on the list with a net worth of US$3.2bn. His father founded the French spirits firm in 1934, while his wife, Edith, is CEO of the company.

La Martiniquaise became the world’s fifth largest producer of Scotch whisky after acquiring the Cutty Sark blend from Edrington. Jean-Pierre Cayard is set to become chairman of fellow French group Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits, in which La Martiniquaise owns a stake.

Luca Garavoglia, chairman of Campari Group, comes in at joint 691st place with Cayard, also boasting a wealth of US$3.2bn. Garavoglia owns an estimated 51% stake in the Italian drinks group, which recently reported a 5.3% increase in its full-year sales, boosted by the soaring global popularity of Aperol.

Brothers Richard and Robert Sands, of Constellation Brands, are jointly placed 838th on the list, with an estimated net worth of US$2.7bn each. The brothers built their business from a small wine operation to a global player in the wine, beer and spirits sectors.

Constellation pioneered the spirits industry’s move into cannabis with the multi-billion-dollar acquisition of a significant stake in Canadian cannabis maker Canopy Growth Corporation.

Robert Sands stepped down as CEO of the group on 1 March this year and was succeeded by its president, Bill Newlands. Robert Sands moved to the position of executive chair, while his brother became executive vice chair.

Other spirits barons named on the list include: Wu Shaoxun, chairman of Chinese liquor producer Jing Brands (#916, US$2.5bn); Charles Bronfman, former co-chairman of Seagram’s (#1008, US$2.3bn); Yuri Shefler, owner of SPI Group (#1425, US$1.6bn); and Nobutada Saji, chairman of Suntory Holdings (#1605, US$1.4bn).",Jose Cuervo and Tito’s bosses lead spirits billionaires

 The video takes a look at the importance of diversity in the advertising sector and shines a spotlight on the organisations “working to address imbalances behind the camera and in creative departments”.

The film also discusses the role of advertising in shaping culture, the historic misrepresentation of women in advertising as well as the schemes supporting “more progressive gender portrayal”.

Diageo is also a sponsor of the Creative Equals ‘Returners’ Scheme, which aims to support women in the creative industries in the UK as they return to work after a career break of at least a year. A group of ‘returners’ will work on ads for Diageo’s Baileys and Guinness brands.

In the short film, Diageo chief marketing officer Syl Saller said: “Through the millennia, culture has been shaped by the stories we tell and if you think about it advertising is telling stories that are backed by billions of dollars to have them heard.

“I am convinced we can normalise gender equality with what we choose to show in our ads, and who we choose to make them.

“We strongly believe that diverse teams create all kinds of different stories, stories which portray men and women as they really are, stories that are eminently relatable.”",Diageo highlights gender equality in advertising

Seville-based Puerto de Indias is working with distribution partner Indie Brands to launch its Puerto de Indias Strawberry Gin in the UK.

As part of its £2m investment, Puerto de Indias will launch a six-figure marketing campaign, which features the phrase ‘It’s not pink, it’s Puerto’.

According to the brand, Puerto de Indias is the first and best-selling strawberry gin in the world. The gin, which launched in 2014 in Spain, is “credited with the proliferation of pink gins”.

Six million bottles of the gin was sold in 2018 in Spain, where the brand is the fourth best-selling gin.

Bottled at 37.5% abv, Puerto de Indias Strawberry Gin is made with fresh strawberries grown locally in Seville. Its suggested serve is over ice with fresh strawberry slices and a wedge of lime, topped with tonic water.

The distillery, based in Carmona, Seville, dates back to 1880 and claims to be one of the oldest in Andalusia. Its gin range also includes Puerto de Indias Pure Black Edition and Puerto de Indias Classic Gin.

Sales of flavoured gin in the UK were driven by pink variants last year and are expected to grow further in 2019, according to the Wine & Spirit Trade Association.

Margaux Maupate​, brand manager for Puerto de Indias, said: “Strawberry gin is a growing trend on the continent, and it is set to take the UK by storm with the rise of pink gins in 2018.

“In the UK alone, flavoured gin drove more than half the growth in the market last year and of that growth, 75% was the result of sales of pink gins.

“We are passionate about our gin and we’ve seen that there is a huge market for strawberry gin variants.

“We have a rich heritage and marry traditional customs of distillation with modern techniques to craft our drinks, and this passion for what we do really shows in the finished product.”

Puerto de Indias Strawberry Gin is available in a 700ml bottle at an RRP of £27 (US$35.30).

The Wine & Spirits Show will take place on 12 and 13 April at The Royal Horseguards Hotel in London, following the success of the inaugural show last year.

The event will encompass two halls – one dedicated to wine and one to spirits – and will feature a number of masterclasses for the trade and consumers.

In the spirits hall, there will be a Global Masters Spirits Zone, where visitors can taste award-winning expressions from the Global Spirits Masters – a series of blind-tasting competitions assessed by completely independent and expert judges.

The area will be manned by some of the judges behind the competition, who can take visitors through the various expressions and tasting processes.

The stand will give visitors the chance to taste an array of spirits from Cornwall-based distillery Pocketful of Stones.

Caspyn Dry Gin contains ingredients including hibiscus flowers, lemon and orange peel, lemongrass, lemon verbena, Japanese tea, gorse and orris.

For fans of something stronger, there’s Morveren Absinthe, bottled at 66% abv. The expression contains Cornish seaweed which gives it an unami flavour. It also has hints of aniseed and herbal undertones.

The brand’s packaging tells the story of a Cornish legend about the mermaid Morveren of Zennor.

Meanwhile, rum lovers can indulge in a coconut-flavoured expression from drinks group Cloudbreak Spirits.

Aluna Coconut, bottled at 35% abv, is a blend of rums from Guatemala and the Caribbean with “all-natural” toasted coconut flavours.

It is also made with virgin sugar cane honey (miel de caña) in order to produce a “lighter and smoother rum” and “remove the need for the large quantities of sugar found in other coconut rums”.

Inspired by the long midsummer days on Scotland’s Orkney, Orkney Gin Company Johnsmas will also be available to taste at the Global Spirits Masters Zone.

Described as “fragrant, fresh and light”, Johnsmas gin is crafted using a variety of hand-picked seasonal botanicals.

Jack Daniel’s maker Brown-Forman has estimated that retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey could knock US$125 million off its 2019 financial results.,8 March 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/03/Brown-Forman-.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/03/brown-forman-to-lose-125-million-if-tariffs-remain/,"Jack Daniel’s maker Brown-Forman has estimated that retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey could knock US$125 million off its 2019 financial results.

The forecast was made by Brown-Forman’s chief financial officer, Jane Morreau, following the publication of the firm’s third quarter and year-to-date sales.

She said that in Q3, Brown-Forman “began to see the cost of tariffs hit not just our cost of sales and growth margins, but also our underlying net sales growth in the quarter and year to date”.

Nations around the world, including EU and China, have implemented retaliatory tariffs on US imports, including American whiskey, in response to Donald Trump’s taxes on imported steel and aluminium last year.

According to US trade association the Distilled Spirits Council, American whiskey exports dropped by 8.7% to US$526m between July and November 2018 after the retaliatory taxes were put in place.

In certain markets where it works with a distributor, Brown-Forman “[lowered] net prices to compensate for the incremental tariff costs that our partners are incurring,” Morreau said.

She continued: “We estimate that these price adjustments reduce our year-to-date underlying net sales growth by approximately one percentage point”.

Morreau predicted that if the tariffs remain in place, Brown-Forman will suffer an annual loss of US$125m, “before taking into account any mitigation action”.

“As we have discussed previously, we have taken actions to mitigate roughly half of the tariffs impact we expect in fiscal 2019,” Morreau said, adding that the cost of tariffs started to impact Brown-Forman’s business in October 2018.

“So we anticipate that we will have about seven months of tariff drag on our results this fiscal year,” Morreau continued.

Jack Daniel’s led Brown-Forman’s performance in the period, but “tariff-related pricing actions” reduced the family of brands’ underlying net sales by one percentage point.

Lawson Whiting, recently appointed CEO of Brown-Forman, said: “While tariffs remain a near-term challenge on American whiskey exports, we will weather the storm as we have on so many other challenges over the last 150 years as we look to create value for our shareholders.”",Brown-Forman to lose $125 million if tariffs remain

Fever-Tree reported that revenue for the year ending 31 December reached £237.4 million (US$313.5m) – up from £170.2 million (US$236.2m) in 2017.

Profit after tax hit £61.8m (US$81.6m), up from £45.5m (US$60m) in 2017.

In the UK, Fever-Tree delivered 53% revenue growth to £134.2m (US$177.2m), consolidating its position as the number one mixer brand in UK retail with 42% market share.

The company’s performance during the summer was aided by hot weather and “significant” national events such as the Fifa World Cup and the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. More gin was sold during summer last year than the summers of 2014 and 2015 combined with the category now worth £1.9 billion (US$2.5bn) in the UK.

The US witnessed a sales revenue growth of 21% to £35.4m (US$46.7m), with growth accelerated “slightly” in the second half of 2018. Fever-Tree took over direct ownership of sales, marketing and distribution in the US in June.

In continental Europe – the group’s second largest region – sales revenue grew by 24% to £55.5m (US$73.7m).

The rest of the world region saw its revenue increase by 48% to £12m (US$15.8m) and “continues to represent plenty of interesting opportunities” for Fever-Tree. Australia, Canada and South Africa all performed “strongly”.

Tim Warrillow, co-founder and CEO of Fever-Tree, said: “2018 was a significant year for Fever-Tree. In the UK, we strengthened our position as the leading mixer brand in the off-trade.

“In the US, we successfully established our own operations and the business made real progress in deepening and widening its presence in multiple European regions.

“As the world’s leading premium mixer brand with a strengthening global distribution network we are well set to drive the international opportunity as the move towards the premium long mixed drink continues to gather momentum around the world.

“At this early stage in the year, the group is trading in line with board expectations and we remain excited about the size of the opportunity that lies ahead.”

Fever-Tree also said it is “closely monitoring the potential impact and risks” of the UK’s upcoming departure from the European Union, including a no-deal scenario. The group has a designated committee who meet regularly to assess preparedness against the different potential scenarios.

Fever-Tree’s outsourced business model and increased European bottling footprint offers a “degree of operational flexibility which leaves the group well placed to respond to and mitigate the potential impacts” of Brexit’s different scenarios.

The group said it will continue to develop limited edition variants, following the “great success” of its Cucumber Tonic last summer which has now joined Fever-Tree’s permanent range.

Brad Beckerman, founder, CEO and chairman of Stillhouse Spirits, filed the lawsuit against Bacardi yesterday (27 March).

He claims his company is now in “mortal danger due to the financial malfeasance of Bacardi and the other financial partners”.

The lawsuit alleges that: “Bacardi convinced Beckerman to provide it inside access and control of Stillhouse through a series of false representations and promises of support.

“To induce Beckerman to relinquish majority ownership and control of Stillhouse, Bacardi represented to Beckerman that it would in the future bring Stillhouse ‘in house’, by buying all of the equity of Stillhouse, including Beckerman’s, at a fair market price.”

It continues to claim that in February and March 2019, Stillhouse experienced record-breaking success and sales, and Bacardi has allegedly “schemed to take the company on the cheap” and has “cut off funding for the company”.

Attorney Skip Miller, a partner at Miller Barondess, in Los Angeles, is representing Beckerman in the lawsuit.

Bacardi, which acquired a minority stake in Stillhouse Spirits more than four years ago, said it has provided “substantial backing” for the company over the years.

However, according to Bacardi, Stillhouse Spirits has apparently “repeatedly failed to deliver the growth promised” and “continued to spend beyond the board-approved budgets”. It claims Stillhouse Spirits is now “on the verge of bankruptcy”.

In a statement, Bacardi said: “Bacardi is an entrepreneurial company with a proven track record of working with new and emerging brands to grow them into household names.

“We made a minority investment in Stillhouse over four years ago because we believed it could be an exciting and disruptive product, and we provided the company with significant ongoing financial and other support.

“Despite our substantial backing, management repeatedly failed to deliver on the company’s business plan and Stillhouse is now on the verge of bankruptcy. Under the leadership of CEO Brad Beckerman, the company has repeatedly failed to deliver the growth promised, and continued to spend beyond the board-approved budgets.

“For nearly six months, we have been diligently working with the other shareholders to find a solution that would save the business. It is very unfortunate that Mr Beckerman would jeopardise Stillhouse’s ability to continue as a going concern by unilaterally filing this frivolous lawsuit just as we were nearing a mutually beneficial resolution.

“The complaint is filled with inaccuracies and misstatements, and we look forward to providing the entire story at the appropriate time. We intend to defend this action vigorously.”",Stillhouse Spirits sues Bacardi for $100m

The exclusive joint partnership will see Tapì and California-based Thinfilm combine their “innovation capabilities to better serve the needs of the wine and spirits industry”. The partnership will cover both tag types and use cases.

“We are thrilled to be joining Tapì in addressing the rampant worldwide counterfeiting problem plaguing their spirits customers, as well as giving brands’ empowered consumers unique and engaging experiences,” said Kevin Barber, chief executive officer of Thinfilm.

“Many brands are looking for new insights in order to move from indirect, transactional engagement to direct, long-term relationships with their consumers, as well as improvements to their packaging that will make the products more attractive and safer.”

The collaboration will create “cost-effective” closure solutions to ensure brand protection. The two firms have started developing NFC-enabled Open Sense closures, which detect when a closure seal has been broken and alerts the consumer that the bottle may have been tampered with.

A second closure type, based on the Thinfilm Speed Tap tag, has been designed to “allow brands to open a direct channel to customers for delivering real-time experiences”.

The companies are working with premium brands to combine NFC-integrated closures into their production lines with minimum disruption. A range of integrated smart closures for the premium spirits market will be released “over the coming months” across a number of styles, designs and protection requirements.

Currently the total global addressable spirits market is estimated to be 65 billion bottles annually.

Tapì Group CEO Roberto Casini said: “We are excited to offer cutting-edge IoT (internet of things) technology in the beverage sector, which will protect and enhance our customers’ products on several fronts.

“Counterfeit products not only cause worldwide losses in the sector, but they are a big health problem.

“In addition, brands are also now looking for new ways to interact with their consumers. These cleverly integrated smart closures can help our customers track and protect their products while at the same time strengthening their reputations on the market by increasing engagement with consumers.”

Scottish football team Aberdeen Football Club has lost a trademark battle against Sherry producer Sandeman over its plan to launch a Scotch whisky under the name ‘Dons Dram’.,21 March 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/03/Sandeman-Don-Fino.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/03/aberdeen-fc-loses-trademark-battle-over-dons-dram-whisky/,"Scottish football team Aberdeen Football Club has lost a trademark battle against Sherry producer Sandeman over its plan to launch a Scotch whisky under the name ‘Dons Dram’.

In 2017, Aberdeen Football Club (FC) applied to register two trademarks – ‘The Dons Dram’ and ‘Dons Dram’ – for goods in class 33 for Scotch whisky at the UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO).

The application was opposed by Port and Sherry producer Sandeman, which has the trademark ‘Don Fino’ for use on alcoholic beverages in the UK and EU, and has a UK trademark for a logo featuring a caped man with a wide Spanish hat and the text ‘The Don’.

Portugal-based Sandeman argued that it had “invested a significant sum in marketing and promotional activities within the UK” featuring ‘The Don’ trademark and that the applicants’ goods were “likely to cause detriment to the reputation” of Sandeman.

The Sherry producer also claimed that the Aberdeen FC’s mark “has the potential to reduce the value of the trademark and also to affect the purchasing decisions of consumers in the marketplace”.

In addition, the mark ‘The Dons Dram’ and ‘Dons Dram’ contains the “identical verbal element” of ‘Don’ and that the word ‘fino’ has “relevant meaning for Sherry and ‘dram’ has a relevant meaning for alcoholic beverages”.

Aberdeen Football Club argued that it has been known as ‘The Dons’ for almost a century, prior to when Sandeman registered its marks. It also said that its application was for Scotch whisky and would be “readily” distinguished from Sandeman’s Sherry products.

In its opposition, the football club also said that the word ‘dram’ is defined as a small measure of whisky, usually Scottish. However, it was noted that it was the word ‘Dons’ that was “likely to attract the majority of the average consumer’s attention”.

The UK IPO ruled in favour of Sandeman, claiming that it is “irrelevant” whether or not fans of the football club refer to it as ‘The Dons’.

The application wrote: “It is far more likely that the vast majority of those interested in football (let alone amongst those with no interest in football) would make no association between the applicant and the words ‘The Dons’.”

The court ordered Aberdeen FC to pay £1,500 to Sandeman in legal costs.

An Aberdeen FC spokesperson said: “We are surprised and disappointed by the outcome as we fail to see how there could be any confusion over what are very different products but we will accept the ruling and move on.”

The Spirits Business has contacted Sandeman for further comment.",Aberdeen FC loses trademark battle over ‘Dons Dram’ whisky
"International days of celebration are an important way for companies to generate greater awareness of their brands and bump up sales – but what about those occasions that hit a little too close to home? Marketing must be more mindful, says ",22 March 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/03/Mothers-Day.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/03/sb-voices-mothers-day-marketing-must-be-more-mindful/,"International days of celebration are an important way for companies to generate greater awareness of their brands and bump up sales – but what about those occasions that hit a little too close to home? Marketing must be more mindful, says Melita Kiely.

Hardly a day goes by when a press release doesn’t ping into my inbox regarding a ‘national’ or ‘international’ day or month of celebration, from incredibly important global observations such as World Mental Health Day and Black History Month, to the more fun diary dates such as World Book Day, and the downright bizarre likes of National Pizza Day and No Trousers on the Tube Day (that’s a real, annual day, you know).

The spirits industry also boasts its fair share of national and international celebrations. From World Margarita Day and World Cocktail Day to World Whisky Day and National Tequila Day, there is no shortage of dates dedicated to toasting your favourite tipples.

Earlier this month, attention turned to International Women’s Day. Press releases came thick and fast in the lead-up to 8 March as brands fought tooth and nail to prove they were indeed pro-women and pro-equality. The effort to improve gender equality has been ramped up over the last year, making this day more significant than ever. But wouldn’t it be great to see this level of female celebration, and empowerment, all-year round?

But 8 March has been and gone, and focus for many brands has now shifted to the UK’s upcoming Mother’s Day on Sunday, 31 March. Press releases suggesting gift ideas, mother-inspired cocktail recipes, Champagne-fuelled afternoon teas and gift packs have inundated the editorial team as brands clamber over one another to secure coverage.

Then a different type of email landed from the team at online retailer The Whisky Exchange. It read:

“We appreciate that not everyone wants to be reminded of Mother’s Day. As such, you can now choose to opt out of any Mother’s Day emails we might send.”

With a simple click of a button, anyone not wanting to be reminded of Mother’s Day could very easily avoid the bombardment of marketing materials.

This is something I’ve seen discussed widely on social media recently – notably with comments from bloggers who have publicly spoken about losing their mothers, only to be approached by PRs to plug their Mother’s Day agendas. Surely a little research could go a long way to avoid causing them unnecessary distress.

The spirits world is unquestionably bettering itself every day. Brands and businesses have made substantial improvements to create an environmentally conscious industry – one that’s been massively welcome and is imperative to our future.

Nevertheless, it’s clear that more still needs to be done to create a wholly compassionate drinks industry, with human empathy deemed just as important as being eco-friendly. This includes everything from the eradication of gendered spirits, workplace harassment, and an equal ratio of male to female employees (including at senior levels) – to the seemingly simple act of taking the time to consider the feelings of the person on the receiving end of that marketing email. It doesn’t end up in cyberspace – there’s a living, breathing person at the end of the chain, and money in your pocket should not come at the cost of their emotional wellbeing.

For while brands may see celebratory occasions such as Mother’s Day, and others like it, as a means to a quick sales boost, for others, it could be a painful date they may not want reminding about at all. It’s not OK to assume everyone has a mother – and in an era when social media feeds will be flooded with pictures and posts celebrating mothers on Sunday 31 March (and of course, they should be celebrated) a simple ‘opt out’ email could be just the olive branch some people need to know that their loss is not being overlooked in the search for sales.

In a week when the world has seen great tragedy from New Zealand to Africa, compassion, in any form, must be welcomed – and mindful marketing is as good a place as any to start.",SB Voices: Mother’s Day marketing must be more mindful

Stuart Gregor, Cameron Mackenzie and Matt Jones, who founded Four Pillars in 2013, hope the investment from Lion will help the brand realise its global ambitions.

Gregor said: “The partnership with Lion really is a ripper for us. It would not be untrue to say that more than a few organisations have shown an interest in us over the past 18 months and Lion just felt the best.

“We like their focus on craft and we like the fact we will be their first and most important craft spirit brand. We have a terrific relationship with the senior management at Lion and reckon this is the start of a really exciting new chapter for our business.”

Lion’s portfolio includes James Squire and Malt Shovel, Little Creatures, Kosciuszko, and Furphy, among others. It is part of Lion Group, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kirin Holdings.

Vanguard Luxury Brands has been the domestic distributor of Four Pillars since 2013, and the companies confirmed the same team will continue to sell Four Pillars to bars, retailers, restaurants and pubs across Australia.

In December last year, Four Pillars brought former Diageo on-trade head Tom Appleton on board as regional trade director.

Later that month, the brand launched its first brand campaign film, a “Wes Anderson-style” introduction to the brand’s signature G&T.",Four Pillars Gin sells 50% stake to Lion
"Rum producers will benefit from a trade continuity agreement between the UK and Caribbean countries, which has been signed as part of ministers’ Brexit preparations.",25 March 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2018/03/Rum-masters-2018.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/03/uk-and-caribbean-sign-post-brexit-trade-deal/,"Rum producers will benefit from a trade continuity agreement between the UK and Caribbean countries, which has been signed as part of ministers’ Brexit preparations.

Last Friday (22 March), the UK minister of state for trade policy, George Hollingbery, signed the Cariforum-UK Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with ministers and representatives from Barbados, Belize, the Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, the Republic of Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

The deal ensures that businesses across the Caribbean will be able to continue to trade without barriers or tariffs. The agreement eliminates all tariffs on all goods imported to the UK from the Caribbean countries, while these Caribbean states will continue to gradually cut import tariffs on most of the region’s imports from the UK.

The new Cariforum-UK EPA replicates the existing trading arrangements as far as possible and is expected to come into effect as soon as the implementation period ends in January 2021, or from as soon as possible after the UK leaves the EU in a no-deal scenario.

The UK is a key export market for the Caribbean. In 2017, around 81% of Guyana sugarcane exports and 64% of Jamaican sugarcane exports went to the UK.

In 2017, total trade between the UK and the Caribbean was worth approximately £2.5 billion (US$3.3bn).

Based on current trade flows, exporters of sugarcane and other sugar products could save more than £20 million (US$26.3m) a year in tariff charges.

Trade body the West Indies Rum & Spirits Producers Association (WISPA) has welcomed the news.

Komal Samaroo, chairman of the WIRSPA, and head of the Guyana-based Demerara Distillers conglomerate, said: “We’re extremely happy to see the culmination of this agreement which both sides have worked hard to achieve.

“The UK is a major export destination for our rums and we are pleased that the trade provisions will maintain our continued access to that market.

“The rum industry is the region’s premier export industry and its largest export earner after minerals, as well as a significant employer.

“The preferential provisions in the agreement will continue to give our authentic rum producers a much-needed boost vis-à-vis subsidised products from other countries.”

The deal also covers the services sector, including tourism, which will benefit Brits who spend a combined £900 million (US$1.1bn) a year in the Caribbean.",UK and Caribbean sign post-Brexit trade deal
"Retaliatory tariffs are having a “significant and growing impact” on American whiskey exports and must be “rapidly addressed”, the Distilled Spirits Council has warned.",22 March 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/02/Big-story-American-flag-US-goverment-shutdown.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/03/growth-of-american-whiskey-exports-slows-amid-trade-row/,"Retaliatory tariffs are having a “significant and growing impact” on American whiskey exports and must be “rapidly addressed”, the Distilled Spirits Council has warned.

The trade body released a new report yesterday (21 March) showing full-year 2018 export data and the “negative impact” that retaliatory tariffs have had on American whiskey shipments during the period. The tariffs were enacted in response to US president Donald Trump’s 10% and 25% import taxes on aluminium and steel respectively.

Last month, the council reported that American whiskey exports had slumped by 8.2% between July and November last year as nations around the world hit back at the the US with their own tariff measures.

The new report covers data for the full 12-month period and shows that American whiskey exports increased by 5.1% in 2018 to a record US$1.18 billion. However, the Distilled Spirits Council said this was a “significant deceleration” from the 16% increase in 2017.

American whiskey exports to the EU grew by 33% in the first half of 2018, but fell by 13.4% in the second half of the year after tariffs were put in place. American whiskey exports to the EU hit US$704 million in 2018, up from US$667m last year.

Total US spirits exports hit new highs of US$1.8bn last year, a 9.5% increase from US$1.64bn in 2017, but the rate of growth “significantly slowed” from the 14.9% growth recorded from 2016 to 2017.

For the first half of 2018, total US spirits exports grew by 26.1% to US$881m. But following the implementation of the retaliatory tariffs, exports during the second half of the year declined by 3% compared to 2017, to US$909m. In the fourth quarter of 2018, exports fell by 13.1% compared to the same period in 2017.

“With the full-year data in hand it is clear that the retaliatory tariffs are having a significant and growing impact on American whiskey exports, which had been a bright spot for US agriculture exports,” said Distilled Spirits Council president and CEO Chris Swonger.

“The damage to American whiskey exports is now accelerating, and this is collateral damage from ongoing global trade disputes.

“These numbers are worrisome – even if some portion of the front-end growth is attributable to larger producers positioning product in foreign markets ahead of the tariffs.”

The Distilled Spirits Council also reported that small distillers had been “particularly hit hard” by the tariffs and had reported lost orders and unreturned calls from local distributors “reluctant to commit to new orders given the uncertainty”.

Large distillers have also reported declining sales in some key export markets as a result of the tariffs, the council said.

Swonger added: “We urge policy makers and our trading partners to rapidly address these retaliatory tariffs before more damage is done to what has been a great American trade success story.”",Growth of American whiskey exports slows amid trade row

Founded by Matt Perkins, the Thameside Rum Company specialises in “unique” blends inspired by the English-Caribbean style of rums that were imported, blended and stored in British dockyards in the 18th century.

The firm has finalised the recipe for its inaugural product, Dockyard Signature Blend, which contains four-year-old pot still rum from Jamaica, five-year-old pot and column still rum from Barbados, and two- to five-year-old pot and column still rum from Guyana.

The rums are blended and reduced to bottling strength at a location based near to the banks of the River Thames.

Thameside is now seeking to raise £10,000 through Crowdfunder to purchase its first batch of rum for blending. If the funds are successfully raised, the company hopes to release Dockyard Signature blend by the end of April.

Investors can choose from range of rewards, including first-batch rum bottles, branded mugs and cocktail shakers, as well as group rum tasting experiences.

“So far we have self funded the project investing time and money in the design and branding through to the sampling and development of our first rum blend,” said Perkins.

“It’s taken around a year to get to this stage, but we believe we’ve got a fantastic, great tasting product with a strong brand identity.”

Thameside will champion “cane to cask” rum production and has pledged to never include sugar, colouring or additional flavouring in its products.

“Consumers deserve to know exactly what’s in the bottle of spirit they’re buying and how it is made,” added Perkins. “Our philosophy is focused on authenticity, integrity and transparency.

“We pride ourselves on producing authentic rums using centuries-old production methods and never add sugar, colouring or flavourings to our blends. What you see in the bottle is pure unfiltered, unadulterated rum. How it used to be.”

A growing number of prominent voices in the rum industry have raised concerns over an apparent lack of transparency from some brands. SB explored the issue in detail here.",UK rum blender launches crowdfunding drive

The one-day course will offer candidates the chance to learn about the human olfactory system, flavour development and the influence of oak in the whisky-making process.

The course will also incorporate odour recognition tests as participants are taught a variety of assessment techniques to boost their flavour recognition and description skills.

Candidates will test a variety of differently aged spirits and whiskies, before learning about flavour manipulation.

Managing director, Kirsty McKerrow, said: “When I started out as a brand ambassador, despite growing up surrounded by whisky heritage, I would have loved to have access to the more in-depth information that we now provide on our courses, which I know would have greatly helped me in my work.

“Whisky is an incredibly complex spirit, with legions of fans across the globe, who have a desire to learn more about the whisky-making craft. This latest course will help whisky professionals and those involved in the hospitality industry to gain the knowledge that can help them deliver a richer whisky experience for their customers, and also offers enthusiasts the chance to delve deep into their favourite topic.”

The diploma is the third whisky course to be launched by the Edinburgh Whisky Academy, which also offers an introduction to whisky certificate, a diploma in single salt and a diploma in gin.

The first diploma in the art of tasting whisky takes place on 3 April at Arniston House, Midlothian, and includes a formal assessment that candidates must pass in order to achieve their certificate.

Orkney distillery Highland Park has teamed up with Danish tattoo artist Colin Dale to launch its first single malt Scotch whisky aged in ex-Rioja wine casks.,25 March 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/03/Colin-Dale.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/03/highland-park-partners-with-tattooist-for-latest-release/,"Orkney distillery Highland Park has teamed up with Danish tattoo artist Colin Dale to launch its first single malt Scotch whisky aged in ex-Rioja wine casks.

Highland Park Twisted Tattoo is a 16-year-old Scotch whisky that has also been aged in first-fill Bourbon casks, creating notes of “light heather peat and soft red fruits”.

The whisky was inspired by the Viking legend of the Modgard Serpent, which grew so large it twisted around the earth to bite its own tail.

Dale, who specialises in the non-electric dot-work tattooing method, created an image of the serpent for the whisky’s bottle design.

“For us, Colin Dale was an ideal choice as a creative partner,” said Jason Craig, global brand director for Highland Park. “He is the perfect example of a modern-day Viking soul and our partnership shows off the similarities between our crafts.

“Tattoos are emotionally important and tell stories on the skin, much like our whisky tells the tales of our Orkney islands’ ancestry. Both arts can be traced back hundreds of years with the traditional skills still playing a key role in the tattooing and whisky making process today.”

Bottled at 46.7% abv, Highland Park Twisted Tattoo is available exclusively from The Whisky Shop in the UK at an RRP of £80.

The Highland Park distillery was founded in Kirkwall, Orkney, in 1798 by Magnus Eunson, a descendent of Vikings who settled in the archipelago more than 1,000 years ago.

In May this year, the brand will open a new visitor experience store in its hometown. The site will include a gallery featuring the work of local artists, a private education area and a retail space offering merchandise and whiskies, including some exclusive to Orkney.

The distillery recently celebrated its Viking heritage with launch of a no-age-statement Amazon-exclusive whisky called Viking Tribe.

According to figures released by the Food and Drink Federation (FDF), food and drink exports from the UK hit £22.6 billion (US$29.9bn) last year, a “slower growth” compared to the 9.7% rise reported in 2017.

During 2018, slower growth was recorded in both exports to EU markets (+4.3%) and non-EU markets (-0.3%). Although there has been a fall in exports to the UK’s non-EU trading partners, three of the top 20 non-EU markets have shown double-digit growth rates (China, Australia, and Singapore).

Seven of the top 20 markets for UK food and drink exports saw a fall in value, including the US and France, which fell by 2.2% and 3.4% respectively.

Whisky remained by far the UK’s most significant export in terms of value, increasing sales by 7.7% to £4.8bn (US$6.3bn) and increasing by 3% in volume. Chocolate is the second most exported UK product, while cheese is the third.

Gin exports from the UK grew 15% by value to £614.4m (US$813.2m) and increased in volume by 11.6%.

Exports of beer fell 7% by value to £48.2m (US$63.8m), while wine increased by 9.8% in value to £630.4m (US$834.4m).

Brexit is a concern for food and drink exporters, the FDF noted. According to its recent confidence survey, 30% of members expressed concern over decreased export profitability, highlighting the pressure that businesses are under across all parts of their business.

Ian Wright CBE, chief executive of the FDF, said: “In defiance of the uncertainty caused by UK exit from the EU, UK food and drink exports continued to grow through 2018.

Phil Hogan, European commissioner for agriculture and rural development, handed the certificate of registration to Julián Ventura, the Mexican vice minister of foreign affairs, and Rodolfo González González, vice president treasurer of the Tequila Regulatory Council (TRC).

“Tequila is the most emblematic alcoholic beverage produced in Mexico and it forms an important part of the Mexican cultural identity,” said Hogan.

“We know very well in Europe how the international success of a regional spirit drink can help to create high-quality jobs in rural areas and generate a strong sense of local and national pride.

“I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to our Mexican colleagues. The addition of Tequila to the EU GI spirits is the latest step on the EU-Mexico journey of cooperation.”

Tequila is made from the distillation of juices from the heart of the blue weber agave plant. The source of the raw material used to make Tequila is located in the centre and west of Mexico, including the town of Tequila in Jalisco.",EU approves Tequila GI
Johnnie Walker maker Diageo has formed an alliance with three other consumer goods companies operating across Africa to improve plastics collection and recycling.,27 March 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/03/Africa-Plastics-Recycling-Alliance.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/03/diageo-and-fmcg-firms-create-africa-plastics-recycling-alliance/,"Johnnie Walker maker Diageo has formed an alliance with three other consumer goods companies operating across Africa to improve plastics collection and recycling.

The UK drinks firm has joined forces with Unilever, The Coca Cola Company and Nestlé to launch the Africa Plastics Recycling Alliance.

The alliance aims to capitalise on the untapped “economic opportunity” behind recycling and reprocessing in Sub-Saharan Africa, which the groups involved claim can create jobs and improve commercial activity.

“Plastics will remain an important packaging material if we are to give African consumers the safe and affordable products they need,” the alliance said in a statement.

“However, we need to ensure that the packaging used ends up in the right place. Unfortunately, a lack of collection and recycling capacity in many African markets coupled with growing populations is creating a growing problem of plastics waste.

“We see an opportunity to tackle that problem in a way that creates jobs and reduces dependency on imported materials while alternatives to plastics are developed.

“Collaboration within and across markets will be key to success so we are proud to launch the Africa Plastics Recycling Alliance today to increase those efforts and play our part as companies in finding solutions that work for Africa.”

The wider spirits industry has increased its efforts to combat plastic waste in recent years, with many brands and bar operators banning the use of single-use plastic straws and stirrers.",Diageo and FMCG firms create Africa Plastics Recycling Alliance

Exclusive spirits bottler The Last Drop Distillers has unveiled two single cask Glenrothes whiskies from 1969.,1 April 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/04/Last-Drop-Glenrothes-1969-280x280.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/04/last-drop-bottles-duo-of-1969-glenrothes-whiskies/,"Exclusive spirits bottler The Last Drop Distillers has unveiled two single cask Glenrothes whiskies from 1969.

Following the company’s launch of Glenrothes 1968 Single Malt Scotch whisky, The Last Drop Distillers is preparing to release two single cask bottlings containing spirit from casks filled on 27 October 1969.

The two ex-Bourbon casks have remained undisturbed until bottling earlier this year, with the first cask yielding 130 bottles, and the second cask 141 bottles.

In a statement, The Last Drop Distillers said: “We are delighted with the second of our trilogy of old Glenrothes single malts. Only a very fortunate few will have the chance to sample these exceptional spirits, which are wonderful examples of fine distilling from the 1960s.

“Each sip transports you back to the heady days of flower power, when revolution was in the air, and on the radio. We commend to all those who truly appreciate the scent and taste of a magnificent old Scotch from a bygone era. You will not be disappointed.”

Whisky writer Charles Maclean shared his tasting notes of the two whiskies, stating that both casks display similar aromatic profiles, but cask number 16203 appeared “drier and less fruity, with snuffed candle at the base”, while cask 16207 had a “smooth texture, with a sweet and sour taste and a long, warming finish”.

Bottled at 45.7% abv and 46.8% abv, the two whiskies carry a recommended retail price of £4,500 (US$5,890).",Last Drop bottles duo of 1969 Glenrothes whiskies

Together, UK gin sales and exports for 2018 are now worth more than £2.7 billion (US$3.5bn), according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association.

Last year, the WSTA said that UK gin sales had broken the £2bn (US$2.6bn) barrier for the first time.

The WSTA’s latest Market Report reveals that sales of gin during the 12-week Christmas period to 29 December 2018 were up 40% on the same period in 2017.

During the first quarter of the last two years, figures show that sales of gin peak in March, in the run up to Mother’s Day (31 March) in the UK.

Between January and March 2017, gin sold in UK supermarkets and shops reached 6.4m bottles, of which 2.6m (41%) of those bottles were sold during March.

Over the same 12-week period last year, nine million bottles of gin were sold, of which 4.7m (52%) of those bottles were sold during March.

The WSTA also noted the growth of flavoured gin, which was valued at £165m (US$216m) in 2018 – a 751% growth compared to 2017.

Miles Beale, chief executive of the WSTA, said: “The truly staggering rise in gin sales shows that British gin is gaining more and more fans by the day. And we fully expect to see sales rise again in March this year, just as they did last year.

“The latest expression of the UK’s fastest growing spirit – pink gin – is one of the ‘go-to’ gifts for Mother’s Day.

“It’s high time gin’s new status and reputation were celebrated and supported by government, which should be offering more support for British gin exports and a less taxing duty regime, both of which fail to support our entrepreneurial and innovative distillers.”",Sales of flavoured gin soar 751% in UK

The micro-distillery’s carbon-neutral certification is the “culmination of a great deal of work over the last year”.

“It doesn’t change our spirits but it’s a statement of what is important to us as a new and growing business,” said Greesand Ridge founder and distiller Will Edge.

“The regulations demand a significant ongoing investment in time and resources and we needed to be well established before we undertook the work. Hopefully, that work can be a template for other businesses in the industry.”

Greensand Ridge commenced production in 2015 with the aim of having an “ultra-low” impact on the environment. The distillery produces gin, eau de vie, rum, and brandy.

Its team has implemented procedures related to renewable power, heat recovery systems, plastics removable and chemical-free production. Greensand Ridge also uses surplus produce from local famers, such as plums and apples, which supermarkets won’t take, to create its products.

“We work with local farmers to mitigate their waste and so make a lot of fruit spirits like our Apple Brandy and Raspberry Ghost,” added Edge. “Even our Wealden Rum is made from a locally sourced by-product.”",Greensand Ridge becomes UK’s ‘first’ carbon-neutral distillery

Diageo employs 4,500 people across the UK, including approximately 3,100 employees in Scotland who are primarily in manufacturing positions.

Mairéad Nayager, chief HR officer at Diageo, said: “True gender equality in the working world requires fundamental changes to a broad range of working practices, including a shake-up of the policies and cultural norms around parental leave.

“Today’s announcement is about matching ambition with action and supporting all of our colleagues – regardless of gender – to experience the joy of raising a young family, while continuing to thrive at work.”

The new policy also offers greater support to parents returning to work, including the option of keeping in touch days, parental coaching, flexible working policies and access to free independent counselling.

Penny Mordaunt, minister for women and equalities, said: “I’m delighted to see Diageo make this move. Shared parental leave gives both mums and dads the chance to spend quality time with their child in the important first months of their life, creating a bond that will last a lifetime.

“Employers can reap the benefits too. We know that flexibility in work is proven to create happier, more loyal and more productive workforces.

“Action like this is exactly what we are encouraging as part of our forthcoming strategy, which will aim to empower every woman in the UK to achieve their true potential.”

On Friday (29 March), May’s deal was overruled for the third time in the House of Commons by 344 votes to 286. The defeat came on the same day that Britain was originally supposed to leave the European Union (EU).

The rejection of May’s plan raises the chances of a long delay to Brexit or Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal on the new deadline of 12 April.

“Like most businesses, those in the UK wine and spirit industry are beginning to despair over how to complete essential tasks, such as plan their movement of goods,” said Miles Beale, chief executive of the WSTA.

“Many firms had, on the advice of the Commission, had to reschedule shipments either side of the original Brexit deadline – unnecessarily as it turns out, and it remains very hard to plan.

“Businesses cannot sustain any more delays and they need some clear direction. Parliament and government have got to get a grip and find a consensus which moves us forward before the growing damage is irreversible.”

A second vote on alternatives to May’s deal will take place today (1 April).

The blend was released on 29 March, the date the UK was initially due to leave the European Union.

The Brexit Blend is made with malt whiskies from England, Scotland and Wales, as well as a blended malt and grain whiskey from Northern Ireland, each aged in a variety of European oak casks.

Created by James Bowker, of The Wilderness, and Sacred Spirits master blender and distiller Ian Hart, the whiskies were blended together at Sacred’s site in Highgate, North London.

Bowker said: “Nobody is enjoying Brexit so until we get some sort of resolution, we might as well start the healing process over a stiff one.”

Whiskies aged for a minimum of six years were selected to provide “elegance and depth of flavour”. The Brexit Blend is said to have a subtle sweetness and flavours of “winter fruit and evil bureaucracy”.

Rémy Cointreau-owned Bruichladdich has revealed plans to build on-site maltings at the Islay distillery in an effort to create a closed loop production process.,1 April 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/04/Bruichladdich-Distillery.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/04/bruichladdich-plans-to-build-onsite-maltings/,"Rémy Cointreau-owned Bruichladdich has revealed plans to build on-site maltings at the Islay distillery in an effort to create a closed loop production process.

Bruichladdich hopes to have the maltings installed at the distillery by 2023, provided planning permission is approved.

As it stands, the distillery grows 42% of its barley locally. The current malting process involves transporting the Islay-grown barley to Inverness for malting.

The distillery said it has to use a malting partner such as Bairds, Inverness, in order to trace the small batches of barley throughout the process, in order to deliver on Bruichladdich’s ethos of provenance and sustainability.

Bruichladdich, which produces The Botanist gin in addition to its namesake whisky, believes bringing the maltings in house will allow the distillery to increase its barley experimentation.

Furthermore, in order to combat the increased energy output required for onsite malting, Bruichladdich is exploring a range of alternative renewable energy sources. It is looking into the possibility of using tidal, water turbine and biomass technologies, or a combination of all three, to generate power.

Douglas Taylor, CEO, said: “Running a business from an island makes us distinctly aware that our social, economic and environmental impact must be a positive one. We feel strongly about our responsibility to the island and the people of Islay.

“In recent years, we have endeavoured to be more sustainable in our operations and more environmental in our actions.

“Some have been straightforward, like stopping using bottled water and introducing the use of electric vehicles, or more complicated, like habitat protection, wildlife corridor agreements with landowners for barley growing or engineering a solution that re-uses the hot waste-water from distillation.

“These actions are just the beginning of a long-term vision to be more sustainable in all we do and to leave behind a bright future for generations to come.”

In September last year, Bruichladdich acquired Shore House Croft farmland, a 30-acre plot of land next to the distillery in order to develop its sustainable farming practices and conduct further barley experimentation.

It is also investing in warehousing and has built two new warehouses over the past three years. Another four warehouses will be constructed over the next few years.",Bruichladdich plans to build on-site maltings
Luxury goods company Lalique Group has paid £15.5 million (US$20.2m) for a 50% stake in Glenturret Scotch whisky as part of a joint venture with Swiss entrepreneur Hansjörg Wyss.,2 April 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/04/Glenturret-exterior.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/04/lalique-forms-joint-venture-for-glenturret-takeover/,"Luxury goods company Lalique Group has paid £15.5 million (US$20.2m) for a 50% stake in Glenturret Scotch whisky as part of a joint venture with Swiss entrepreneur Hansjörg Wyss.

In December last year, Edrington sold the Glenturret distillery, home of The Famous Grouse Scotch whisky, to French wine producer Art & Terroir. The Art & Terroir wine business is owned by Silvio Denz, chairman and main shareholder of Lalique Group.

Switzerland-headquartered Lalique Group and Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss will each own a 50% stake in The Glenturret through the joint venture, called Glenturret Holding.

Following the closing of the transaction on 29 March 2019, The Glenturret distillery, brand, warehouses, whisky stocks and visitor centre will become part of Glenturret Holding.

Denz provided a loan of CHF 4 million for the company’s 50% stake.

During 2019, the Lalique Group aims to propose to its shareholders a capital increase by way of a rights issue to refinance parts of Denz’s loan and pay for other growth initiatives. The loan will be paid over the next few years.

Details of Wyss’s payment for the remaining 50% stake have not been disclosed.

Wyss, who has owned a 3.64% stake in the Lalique Group through the Hansjörg Wyss Trust since 2015, will join Glenturret’s board of directors.

Denz said: “With The Glenturret now part of Lalique Group, we see considerable opportunities to leverage both brands, and we are committed to developing attractive joint initiatives to further strengthen our business.”

The Lalique Group takes its name from French crystal brand Lalique, which was created in Paris in 1888 by the master glassmaker and jewellery designer René Lalique.

Lalique Group will “fully consolidate and will further develop the Glenturret business by leveraging both brands and its international network”. The deal will also implement joint initiatives in product design, distribution and hospitality. Through the joint venture, the Lalique Group will also control the board of directors.

The acquisition also includes more than one million litres of maturing whisky, aged in various cask types and at different strengths, with the oldest dating back to 1987. The stocks will allow for the blending of high-end single malts ranging in age from 10 to 40 years, as well as special edition releases.

In 2018, Glenturret posted a “modest” net profit of around £200,000 (US$260,520), which Lalique said is “not reflective of the actual profitability potential of the business and is due to significant intra-group sales at discount prices” under Edrington’s ownership.

After “moderate initial investments” over the next two years, Glenturret is expected to make “significantly higher and increasing contributions” to the company’s profits going forward.

Lalique Group sees “significant potential” in developing The Glenturret in the high-end single malt Scotch whisky market.

The Glenturret distillery has the ability to “considerably expand” its current production level of around 170,000 litres per year “without the need for significant investments”.

In the future, production will triple to around 500,000 litres annually, with increased volumes set to become available for blending by around 2026/2027. Predicted output for 2019 is 205,000 litres.

The team at Glenturret is expected to increase from 25 to 30 people to “enable the business to run on a stand-alone basis”.

Lalique Group will also “leverage its global network” across shops, online, hotels, restaurants and distribution capabilities to boost the Lalique and Glenturret brands together.

Among its joint plans for the brands are dual marketing initiatives, Glenturret whisky bottles by Lalique and limited edition whisky decanters in Lalique crystal.

A renovation of the visitor centre is also planned, with a Lalique shop expected to open onsite by 2020.",Lalique forms joint venture for Glenturret takeover

Unveiled yesterday (3 April) at the Martell Cognac distillery in France, the targets aim to support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The group’s eight new Sustainability and Responsibility commitments focus on four key areas: nurturing terroir, valuing people, circular making and responsible hosting. Each one endeavours to address issues such as climate change, human rights and waste.

Alexandre Ricard, chairman and chief executive officer, said: “We are 19,000 ‘créateurs de convivialité’ – passionate hosts but also respectful guests on our planet.

“Sharing our values, respecting our terroirs and promoting responsible consumption are all conditions for sustainable growth. Yesterday, today and tomorrow, we will continue to create for the long-term.”

In relation to ‘nurturing terroir’, the group has pledged that by 2030, 100% of its global affiliates will have a strategic biodiversity project.

Secondly, by 2025, Pernod Ricard will develop regenerative agriculture pilot projects within its own vineyards in eight wine regions from Argentina and California to Cognac and Spain. By 2030, the group will partner with more than 5,000 farmers to pass on what it has learned.

In terms of ‘valuing people’, Pernod Ricard has promised equal pay across its business by 2022, and gender balance in top management teams by 2030. By the end date, 100% of employees will have received future-fit training at least every three years to develop new skills.

Pernod has also said it will train 10,000 bartenders on how to host consumers in a more sustainable way, including educating them about being waste-free and plastic-free.

Packaging and waste are highly topical at the moment, and as part of its ‘circular making’ pledge, Pernod Ricard will ban all promotional items made from single-use plastic by 2025. Furthermore, 100% of its packaging will be recyclable, compostable, reusable or bio-based.

By 2030, the group will trial new circular ways of distributing wine and spirits to help increase recycling rates in its top 10 biggest markets with low recycling levels.

In addition to this, Pernod promises to address its water balance and carbon footprint by 2030, when it aims to be water balanced in all high-risk watersheds, such as India and Australia, replenishing 100% of water consumption from production sites.

When it comes to tackling alcohol misuse, by 2030 every affiliate of Pernod Ricard will have at least one programme to combat alcohol misuse.

Lastly, the group will expand its Responsible Party programme globally to reach at least one million people by 2030. The programme was established a decade ago in partnership with the Erasmus Student Network to raise students’ awareness about responsible consumption and has reached 400,000 students across Europe so far.

Vanessa Wright, VP sustainability and responsibility, said: “We know that our customers have now come to expect our brands to be responsible and respectful of the environment – values that have been at the very heart of our business since its inception.

“These 2030 commitments provide us with a focused framework across our business in helping to address some of the biggest sustainability issues, so consumers can enjoy our products in a convivial and sustainable way.”",Pernod sets out 2030 Sustainability and Responsibility goals

Sliabh Liag, which produces An Dúlamán Irish Maritime Gin and The Legendary Silkie Irish Whiskey, submitted the application to Donegal County Council today (4 April).

Subject to approval, the construction of the distillery in Ardara is expected to start later this year, with distilling operations beginning in 2020.

Led by company directors James and Moria Doherty and James Keith, the site will employ at least 40 people. It will have the production capacity of 400,000 litres annually – the equivalent of around 1,700 filled casks and more than 1.2 million bottles of whiskey.

The company plans to create a number of brands, including Ardara and Sliabh Liag Irish single malt and pot still whiskeys, which will be heavily peated and “authentic to the style of 19th century whiskeys” from County Donegal.

Sliabh Liag will also move its gin still from Carrick to the new building.

Plans for the new visitor centre include a poitín museum, exhibition space, tasting bar and shop.

The site will be designed by Corner Stone Architecture to “complement the village and its natural surroundings”.

James Doherty, managing director of Sliabh Liag Distillers, said: “The design of the development is a mix of contemporary and traditional finishes which complement the village of Ardara.

“We have put considerable thought into the visitor experience and aim to create an opportunity for visitors to park in the village, walk along the Owentocker river, across a new footbridge and into the Show Field.

“It is important to us that local businesses benefit from the footfall, and if we can get visitors walking in the village, increasing their dwell time, then so much the better for the entire community.”

“Enhancing Ardara’s offering to its community and visitors has been a major consideration throughout the design process.

“We intend to conserve the portion of the land nearest to the village as an open green space, with walkways and ponds providing a beautifully landscaped area to be enjoyed by everybody.”",Sliabh Liag submits plans for €6m whiskey distillery

The Irish whiskey industry worked with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to submit the Irish whiskey technical file in 2014.

The file detailed the different types of Irish whiskey, including malt Irish whiskey, pot still Irish whiskey, grain Irish whiskey and blended Irish whiskey, as well as their individual production techniques.

This was in keeping with a 2008 EU Spirit Regulation, which required member states to submit a technical file to the European Commission for each GI registered by 20 February 2015, outlining production methods, ingredients and links with the geographical area in question.

Carleen Madigan, legal advisor to the Irish Whiskey Association (IWA), said: “This is a momentous achievement for the Irish whiskey industry and ensures that the traditions and high standards of the Irish whiskey category will be protected in the EU and globally in markets with which the EU has a trade agreement.

“As sales of Irish whiskey continue to boom globally, we have seen a trebling in the complaints to the association regarding fake Irish whiskey around the world.

“The geographic indication provides the strongest possible protection against these infringements and gives us the basis for enforcement action against misleading products.”

The IWA welcomed the approval of Irish whiskey’s GI status, as well as those for Irish cream and Irish poitín.

Vincent McGovern, head of the IWA, said: “This week’s announcement was likewise of great significance to both Irish cream and Irish poitín as their technical files were also approved.

“Both categories will benefit from the strong protection and higher profile a European geographic indication provides at home, across the internal market and in export markets worldwide.”",Irish whiskey gains GI status from European Commission

In the 12 months to 28 February 2019, the Svedka vodka maker saw its operating income increase to US$2.6bn. The company’s fiscal year was bolstered by the double-digit net sales and operating income growth of Constellation’s beer business.

The group’s wine and spirits arm saw its net sales fall by 0.2% to US$2.92bn, while operating income declined by 2.9% to US$7.71bn.

Wine and spirits benefited from “double-digit distribution gains” for High West whiskey and wine brands Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Ruffino Sparkling and Cooper & Thief.

In the three months ending 28 February 2019, net sales of wine and spirits dropped by 7.6%. During the fourth quarter, High West and wine brands Kim Crawford, Meiomi, Ruffino and the Prisoner portfolio posted double-digit consumer takeaway trends in IRI channels.

Svedka vodka witnessed “strong sales growth” in the fourth quarter boosted by the brand’s new Bring your own Spirit marketing campaign, which “improved consumer brand awareness and purchase intent”.

Constellation’s full-year and fourth quarter 2019 results were announced just after the company agreed to sell approximately 30 wine and spirits brands to E&J Gallo Winery for US$1.7bn.

In a statement, Constellation confirmed the sale includes its Paul Masson brandy and Black Box vodka brands. The deal mostly relates to Constellation’s wine portfolio.

Bill Newlands, president and CEO, said: “We’ve positioned our wine and spirits business for success with our announced plans to sell a portion of the business, which enables us to continue to strategically focus on our powerhouse, high-margin, high-growth brands.

“Overall, we’re confident in our ability to drive top-line growth of mid-to-high single digits over the next three to five years across our entire business.”

Looking ahead to fiscal 2020, the company expects net sales of its wine and spirits to decline by 25-30% and operating income to drop by 30-35% as a result of the divestment.

Proceeds from the deal are expected to be used mainly for the repayment of debt. This is expected to have an approximate US$40 million favourable impact on fiscal 2020 interest expense.

Constellation completed its US$4bn additional investment in cannabis producer Canopy Growth Corporation in November last year. For Q4, Canopy Growth equity earnings and related activities made a loss of US$2.6m on a reported basis.

David Klein, chief financial officer, said: “In fiscal 2018, we generated record operating cash flow of more than US$2.2 billion, which enabled a return of more than US$1 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.”",Constellation delivers 7% net sales growth in FY

The Helsinki-headquartered group will continue operating the border trade between Denmark, Sweden and Germany.

With the new collaboration, Altia is looking for a “stronger” route-to-market locally both in the off- and on-trade to enable the firm to further promote its Nordic brands.

As part of the deal, 12 Altia employees have been given the opportunity to transfer to the Danish firm.

The new partnership will see Conaxess Trade become one of the market leaders in spirits in its native country.

“We are very much looking forward to enter in this strategic partnership with Conaxess Trade Beverages,” said Janne Halttunen, senior vice president, Scandinavia at Altia.

“They have shown strategic and operational strength in Denmark and we are looking forward to continuing the positive development of the Altia brands.

“We strongly believe, that this new set-up gives possibilities to further grow Altia brands in Denmark.”

Jan Rose, managing director of Conaxess Trade Beverages, added: “We are excited to represent Altia’s iconic brands in our premium spirits portfolio.

“With our strong market position and our expertise at the Danish market we see good possibilities to strengthen distribution and sales of Altia brands.”",Altia to bolster brands in Denmark with Conaxess deal
"Archaeologists are embarking on an excavation at the site of one of the earliest legal whisky distilleries in Scotland, dating back to 1825.",10 April 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/04/Blackmiddens.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/04/dig-to-unearth-scotlands-secret-whisky-history/,"Archaeologists are embarking on an excavation at the site of one of the earliest legal whisky distilleries in Scotland, dating back to 1825.

The Cabrach Trust is leading the dig, which is taking place from 8-11 April at Blackmiddens, a ruined steading in the Cabrach parish on the border between Moray and Aberdeenshire. It marks the first excavation of a traditional small farm distillery.

The farm was one of the first to be granted a licence to produce whisky following the introduction of the 1823 Excise Act, which legalised small-scale distilling.

“The Cabrach is a place of many secrets. For decades local farmers secretly distilled whisky and smuggled it away under the noses of excisemen,” said Anna Brennand, chief executive of the Cabrach Trust, which was established to preserve the history of an area notorious for illegal whisky distillation and smuggling.

“Then, when the law was changed to make small-scale whisky production profitable, Blackmiddens was one of the first farms to take advantage of this.”

Researchers believe the farm would have used a 180-litre (40-gallon) still – much smaller than today’s stills that can hold thousands of litres. It produced whisky for eight years, from 1825-1833, after which the farm fell into ruin.

The excavation will allow archaeologists to record the character and size of the visible remains, and explore the relationship between the distillery and the farm steading.

Joan Harvey, 66, said her great, great uncle, James Sharp, was a tenant farmer at Blackmiddens and a ringleader of a whisky smuggling gang.

“Apparently my great, great grandfather had a white stallion and when the excisemen were billeted locally he would ride his white horse, alerting everyone that the excisemen were there so that the whisky smugglers could go to ground,” she said.

“I was also told that, one time, the excisemen were trying to catch the smugglers and had set up barricades all around Aberdeen. My great, great uncle hired a horse-drawn hearse and loaded the coffin with whisky.

“When he reached the excisemen, they all took off their hats as a mark of respect for the dead, and the whisky went through.”

Historic illicit stills can be found throughout the Scottish Highlands, but are particularly common in Cabrach. When the Excise Act was amended in 1823, illicit distillers came down from the hills and set up production in farmsteads.

The dig has been supported with funding and assistance from Forestry and Land Scotland, which manages Blackmiddens, and Historic Environment Scotland.",Dig to unearth Scotland’s ‘secret’ whisky history

Johnnie Walker maker Diageo has lodged planning applications to “transform” the visitor experiences at Cardhu and Clynelish as part of its £150 million (US$195m) investment in Scotch whisky tourism.,8 April 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/04/Cardhu.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/04/diageo-seeks-approval-for-cardhu-and-clynelish-upgrades/,"Johnnie Walker maker Diageo has lodged planning applications to “transform” the visitor experiences at Cardhu and Clynelish as part of its £150 million (US$195m) investment in Scotch whisky tourism.

The UK drinks group announced its £150m investment plans last April. Phased over three years, the funds will be used to build a new visitor attraction for Johnnie Walker in Edinburgh, and upgrade Diageo’s 12 distillery visitor centres in Scotland.

Four distilleries – Cardhu, Clynelish, Glenkinchie and Caol Ila – will be “linked directly” to the Johnnie Walker venue in Edinburgh.

In November, Diageo submitted its plans for Caol Ila. In February this year, the group filed a planning application to transform 146 Princes Street in Edinburgh into a seven-storey visitor centre for Johnnie Walker.

Now, Diageo has submitted plans for Cardhu and Clynelish to the distilleries’ local authorities: Moray Council and Highland Council.

Under the plans, Cardhu will become the “Speyside home” of Johnnie Walker and Clynelish will become the “Highland home” of the brand. Both will be “thematically linked” to the Johnnie Walker attraction.

According to Diageo, Cardhu and Clynelish are two of the “most important” single malts used in the Johnnie Walker blend. Cardhu was the first distillery to be acquired by John Walker & Sons in 1893, while Clynelish has a “long association” with the brand.

Cardhu’s revamped visitor centre will highlight the story of Helen and Elizabeth Cumming, the women who established and ran the distillery in the 19th century. Meanwhile, plans for new external landscaping around the distillery will enhance access and create a new orchard space for visitors.

“This is an important step in our plans for the distillery. We have already shared our initial plans with the local community and now we look forward to working with local stakeholders as we progress the planning process,” said Laura Sharp, Cardhu Distillery brand home manager.

“Speyside is a hugely important part of the Scotch whisky tourism map and we are very excited by the plans for Cardhu, which we believe will bring new visitors to the distillery and to the region.”

Plans for Clynelish, first outlined in March this year, include the construction of a new upper floor, as well as a new bar and tasting area offering panoramic views of the Sutherland coast.

“This is another significant milestone on our journey to transform the visitor experience at Clynelish,” said Jacqueline James-Bow, Clynelish Distillery brand home manager.

“We have seen great growth in tourism over recent years with the NC500 [road trip] bringing new visitors to the Highlands. We believe the investment we are making at the distillery will create a major new attraction and help bring more tourists to this part of the world in the future.”

Subject to planning approval, work on the distilleries is scheduled to commence later this year, with completion expected in late 2020.

In addition to the £150m investment in its Scotch whisky ‘brand homes’, Diageo will spend £35m (US$46m) reviving its Port Ellen and Brora distilleries.",Diageo seeks approval for Cardhu and Clynelish upgrades

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned The Macallan’s first global advertising campaign for promoting “risky or daring behaviour”.,10 April 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2018/11/Macallan-campaign.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/04/macallan-ad-banned-for-promoting-risky-behaviour/,"The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned The Macallan’s first global advertising campaign for promoting “risky or daring behaviour”.

The Macallan’s Make the Call campaign was released in November last year, “marking a new chapter” for the Edrington-owned Scotch whisky brand – hot on the heels of the opening of its new £140 million (US$180m) distillery.

Make the Call centred around the theme of “bold decision making” and featured a 90-second “hero film”.

However, the ASA received six complaints about the advert – which was broadcast on various platforms including TV and Instagram – questioning whether the advert was irresponsible and connected alcohol with “daring, toughness or irresponsible behaviour”.

The Make the Call video features a man jumping off a cliff and falling towards the ground. As he falls, feathers begin to emerge from his arms and he grows wings.

The on-screen text stated: “Would you risk falling… for the chance to fly?” The man then pulls out of the nosedive with his fully-grown wings, and flies upwards. The clip ends with text: “The Macallan. Make the call.”

While the ASA noted that some parts of the ad were “fantastical”, including how far the man fell through the clouds and his sprouting of wings, it ruled that the tagline question was one that promoted risky or daring behaviour.

It considered the man jumping off the cliff to be akin to the extreme sport of base-jumping.

The ASA said: “Although the character was not seen consuming alcohol at any point, we considered the ads made a clear association between an alcoholic product and potentially very dangerous, daring behaviour and concluded that they were irresponsible.”

In its decision, the ASA ruled: “The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Edrington Distillers Ltd t/a Macallan to ensure in future their ads did not link alcohol with daring, toughness or irresponsible behaviour.”

In defence of the complaints, Edrington said the term ‘make the call’ was used globally to describe the brand’s philosophy, and was a nod to decisions The Macallan had made in its past. Edrington added that the line was also relevant to decisions viewers make in their own lives.

The company said the story was “mystical, almost mythical” and “clearly removed from the real world”. It refuted the claims the ad was irresponsible, or linked alcohol with bravery, daring or toughness. Furthermore, it highlighted that the ad did not show any alcohol consumption.

In addition, ad clearance agency Clearcast said it had considered the issue of daring and toughness when clearing the ad, and decided the concept was fantastical enough to be acceptable.

The ad was also shown on ITV Hub, a catch-up service for ITV channels in the UK. ITV said the ad was “imaginary, fanciful and dreamlike”. Meanwhile Instagram said the ad did not violate its policies and it had not received any complaints about the video.

A spokesperson for The Macallan said: “The Macallan co-operated fully with the Advertising Standards Authority in response to a small number of complaints about our brand’s global awareness campaign. Prior to launching the campaign, we worked closely with the relevant bodies including Clearcast, ITV and Instagram who all deemed the campaign 100% acceptable.

“In light of the ASA ruling, we have acted to address their concerns and removed the campaign film from relevant channels accessible by the UK audience. As phase one of the campaign is now complete, we will take onboard the ruling as we plan for [the] next phase of the campaign.

“The overall theme of the global campaign is about bold decision making and targeting a new generation of consumers. This will continue to be the focus of the global campaign, though we will of course take on board the ASA’s comments in relation to the film elements in the UK market as we develop the campaign in the future.”",Macallan ad banned for promoting ‘risky behaviour’
Scotch whisky maker Speyside Distillery anticipates its production will increase by 66% to cater for Chinese demand after signing a distribution deal with Luzhou Laojiao International Development.,8 April 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/04/Speyside-distillery.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/04/speyside-distillery-to-ramp-up-production-66/,"Scotch whisky maker Speyside Distillery anticipates its production will increase by 66% to cater for Chinese demand after signing a distribution deal with Luzhou Laojiao International Development.

Luzhou Laojiao International Development, a leader in the travel retail channel, will distribute Speyside Distillery’s Spey and Beinn Dubh brands in China, a market that saw Scotch whisky sales soar 34.8% in the first half of 2018, according to the whisky producer. Luzhou Laojiao will also distribute the brands in duty free markets in the US and other travel retail markets.

As a result, the Scotch whisky producer expects production to increase from 600,000 litres to one million litres of alcohol per year.

Distillery owner Speyside Distillers said the production increase would not result in new automation processes, but said it could create two new jobs.

John McDonough, chief executive officer of Speyside Distillers, said: “Although our brands have been present in China for a number of years, most of the distribution and sales activity has been within the southern provinces.

“This distribution agreement with Luzhou Laojiao will enable us to move to a completely different level and will help to meet the growing demand for single malt Scotch whisky from China’s urbanised, affluent young professionals.

“We anticipate that the supply demand for global duty free and duty paid within China will have a significant impact on production, which we forecast will rise by around 66% from our current 600,000 litres of spirit a year to one million litres.”

Luzhou Laojiao representatives signed the deal while on a visit to Speyside Distillery, which is located near Kingussie at the foot of the Cairngorms.

Patricia Dillon, managing director of Speyside Distillers, said: “Our international reach has grown significantly in the past five years and our brands are now present in 34 different countries.

“Due to John’s existing business operations in Taiwan when he bought the distillery, we were very quickly able to cultivate a market for Spey in that territory and it has historically always been a key driver for sales.

“Around 70% of our global sales currently come from that region, but this agreement with Luzhou Laojiao for global duty free and internally within China sets us on a path that will challenge the volume that we have in Taiwan.

“China is a market that we have watched very diligently for a number of years, but we needed the support of a major partner before we could contemplate making the significant inroads that we now anticipate.”",Speyside Distillery to ramp up production 66%

Diageo introduced Gordon’s Premium Pink Distilled Gin in July 2017, which contains flavours of raspberry, strawberry and redcurrant.

Bottled at 37.5% abv, Gordon’s Pink first launched exclusively in Tesco stores across the UK, priced at £16.50 (US$21), before it was rolled out to UK bars in August the same year.

Speaking to The Spirits Business earlier this week, Kathy Parker, Diageo’s senior vice president of portfolio Scotch, Haig Club, premium core gins, Captain Morgan and Latin rum, said: “Pink has been a runaway success. We’ve taken just over a year to get to a million cases where it’s taken other gin brands 20 years. It’s an indication of how massive Pink has been.

“I think what is fantastic is that it recruits new drinkers to the brand and category. People who didn’t historically drink gin can find something in Gordon’s Pink, whether it’s the colour, or the serve, or the strawberry garnish, which makes people feel a bit more special.

“For people who rejected gin feeling it was a bit bitter for their taste, Pink is slightly sweeter and more fruity.”

Pink gin has been one of the biggest spirits trends of the past year. Following the launch of Gordon’s, Pernod Ricard brought out its own colourful variant in 2018 – Beefeater Pink.

Other pink variations on the market include Pinkster, That Boutique-y Gin Company’s Proper Pink Gin, and Bacardi’s Bosford Rose Premium Gin & Strawberry Liqueur.

Pink gin expressions were praised for boosting flavoured gin sales in the UK last year, which are expected to grow further in 2019.

According to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA), gin sales in the UK were valued at £1.9 billion (US$2.4bn) in 2018 after more than 66m bottles were sold throughout the year. This was attributed to the growth of pink and flavoured gins, as new products continue to flood the market.",Gordon’s Pink gin smashes one-million-case mark
Trade body The Gin Guild has unveiled a new flavour guidance tool for gin to “increase knowledge and enjoyment of the category”.,24 May 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2017/07/gin-botanicals.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/05/gin-flavour-tool-launches-to-educate-consumers/,"Trade body The Gin Guild has unveiled a new flavour guidance tool for gin to “increase knowledge and enjoyment of the category”.

The tool, called Gin-Note, has been created to help consumers and the industry navigate through the vast amount of gin brands available on the market.

Gin-Note provides a standard flavour summary graphic, which is prepared by the producers using a fixed and directed framework, alongside a description of the gin. It also provides recommendations on mixers, garnishes and preferred serves for each gin.

More than 50 gins have signed up to the flavour tool, including Tanqueray, Gordon’s, Beefeater, Plymouth, Sipsmith, Arbikie and Kyrö.

Nicholas Cook, director general of The Gin Guild, said: “With significant growth in the number of distilleries producing gins, consumers and others are faced with choosing from a growing number of gin styles and tastes.

“An amazing variety of botanicals are being used in gin, with distillers using creativity, imagination and innovation. Faced with what is often a wall of gin on sale, while great for brands and offering great options for choice, consumers are often left scratching their heads as to what to buy.

“Consumers often end up arbitrarily choosing their gin based on price, or bottle design, and without knowing whether they will like the flavour of the chosen brand. As it is the liquid itself that is the key element, to buy without having adequate information is madness.

“Gin-Note provides retailers, distributors and gin drinkers with key flavour information and guidance, in an easy-to-read format, offering a greater chance to appreciate this amazingly versatile spirit. It has the potential to be a real step forward for the industry and consumers alike.”

Members of The Gin Guild can sign up to the Gin-Note as an inclusive benefit, however it will also be available to non-members.

Cook added: “We are also happy to provide access to non-members who are producing qualifying gins, as the true potential of the summary can best be seen when consumers are able to see one profile against another as an aid for choice, so ideally they need across-the-board reference.

“In time we see the profiles being deployed both by retailers and in menu form, for example by bars seeking to inform and guide their customers.”

The US has come to an agreement with Canada and Mexico to repeal retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey exports to both countries.,20 May 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2019/03/Rare-whisky.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/05/canada-and-mexico-revoke-american-whiskey-tariffs/,"The US has come to an agreement with Canada and Mexico to repeal retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey exports to both countries.

Canada introduced a 10% tariff on American whiskey on 1 July 2018 in response to US president Donald Trump’s 10% and 25% import taxes on aluminium and steel respectively.

Meanwhile, Mexico slapped a 25% retaliatory tariff on American whiskey from 5 June 2018.

Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, said: “With this critical issue now resolved, we look forward to joining the various efforts to support the prompt congressional passage of US-Mexico-Canada agreement, which includes important benefits for our industry.

“We are very encouraged by today’s news and we hope the US and our trading partners can build on this positive momentum to resolve all of the remaining retaliatory tariffs that our US distilled spirits exports face, particularly the European Union’s 25% tariff on American whiskey.”

The Distilled Spirits Council has voiced concerns over the retaliatory tariffs in the past, and said small distillers had been hit particularly hard by the tariffs.

A report released by the Distilled Spirits Council in March this year showed the “negative impact” the tariffs had on American whiskey exports.

The data showed that American whiskey exports dropped 8.2% between July and November 2018.

For the entire year, American whiskey exports were up 5.1% and reached a record US$1.18 billion. However, this was a “significant deceleration” from the 16% growth in 2017, the Distilled Spirits Council said.

Exports to the EU, where tariffs are still in place, grew 33% in the first half of 2018, but fell by 13.4% in the second half of the year after tariffs were introduced. American whiskey exports reached US$704 million in 2018, up from US$667m in 2017.

Earlier this year, Brown-Forman estimated that retaliatory tariffs could slice US$125m off its 2019 financial results.

The whisky is a blend of malts distilled in “milestone” years during the Rolling Stones’ history, including a mizunara oak-aged malt from 1962, which was the year the band was formed.

The blend also includes whisky from 1971, which was when the band’s iconic ‘tongue and lips’ logo was released. The original artwork is on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Set to go under the hammer on 5 June, the lower end of the whisky’s auction estimate is £25,000 (US$31,748).

Martin Green, Bonhams whisky specialist in Edinburgh, said: “This remarkable whisky is a fitting tribute to a brand that has been at the top of its game for decades.

“Only 150 bottles of Suntory Rolling Stones 50th Anniversary whisky were ever released, and on the rare occasions they appear at auction there is always a great deal of excitement and interest.”

The auction will also includes six bottles recovered from the wreck of the SS Politician, which sank in the Sound of Eriskay, in the Outer Hebrides, in 1941.

The bottles were legally salvaged in 1990 and are accompanied by copies of the letter of declaration from HM Customs.

After the ship foundered, islanders illegally salvaged goods from the wreck, an act that was later depicted in Compton MacKenzie’s 1947 novel Whisky Galore.

The six bottles include a Ballantine’s whisky, VAT 69 and four from Gilbey’s, each expected to sell for between £6,000 (US$7,620) and £8,000 (US$10,160).",Rolling Stones whisky features in Bonhams auction
"Alcohol brands “need to rethink” how they market to men, with adverts portraying “old fashioned” and “toxic” views of masculinity, according to a new study.",21 May 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2017/07/social-media.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/05/survey-alcohol-brands-must-rethink-how-they-market-to-men/,"Alcohol brands “need to rethink” how they market to men, with adverts portraying “old fashioned” and “toxic” views of masculinity, according to a new study.

A survey of 2,000 UK adults by New Macho, the specialist men’s marketing arm of brand agency BBD Perfect Storm, found that when buying products, men are almost twice as likely as women to think about what the brand name or label says about them.

The research asked men to what extent certain key FMCG brands reflect their attitudes and values.

The study noted that when it comes to alcohol, brands “need to rethink” their marketing to men. “Many old fashioned, dated and perhaps toxic views of masculinity are still prevalent among British males, thanks in part to the stereotypes seen in advertising,” the survey claimed.

Nearly half of men (48%) feel that Johnnie Walker blended Scotch whisky doesn’t reflect them at all, while 54% feel the same about Gordon’s Gin.

Meanwhile, 43% of men say Absolut Vodka doesn’t have the same values, while 43% think that way about Bacardi rum.

When it comes to beer, 46% of men feel that Guinness doesn’t reflect them at all, and 47% feel the same about Heineken.

The study also found that 49% of men feel Diet Coke doesn’t have the same values.

The survey also revealed that a quarter of males (25%) still believe the view that ‘real men don’t crack under pressure’ – rising to 37% among millennials and 41% of Londoners. In addition, one in seven UK males (14%) think that ‘real men don’t cry’, rising to 27% of those in London.

New Macho managing director Fernando Desouches said: “The groups that are most likely to hold these stereotyped views of masculinity – Londoners, millennials and high earners – are also the most likely to feel depressed or sad.

“More than half of these groups most often feel that way, so these beliefs may be having a very real and negative impact on men’s mental health.

“The ad industry has to accept some of the blame for this, as many food and drink brands are still portraying men either as aloof and hyper-competitive or as dorks and figures of fun.

“It’s all just gender stereotyping, which the Advertising Standards Authority is rightly working to eradicate.”",Drinks ads portray ‘toxic’ masculinity

The UK government has confirmed it will ban plastic straws and stirrers in England from April 2020.,22 May 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2018/01/plastic-straws.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/05/uk-government-to-ban-plastic-straws-next-year/,"The UK government has confirmed it will ban plastic straws and stirrers in England from April 2020.

The plan to ban plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds was announced in October last year, subject to a consultation.

The move comes as part of plans to protect rivers and oceans, and meet the UK government’s 25 Year Environment Plan to eliminate “avoidable” plastic waste.

Following the six-week consultation, the results revealed more than 80% of respondents support a ban on the distribution and sale of plastic straws, and 90% back a ban on plastic drinks stirrers.

The ban will include exemptions to ensure that those with medical needs or a disability can continue to access plastic straws. Pubs, bars and restaurants will not be able to display plastic straws but are able to provide them on request.

Registered pharmacies will be allowed to sell plastic straws over the counter or online.

The UK government will carry out a stocktake after one year to assess the impact of these measures.

Kate Nicholls, CEO of UK Hospitality, said: “We fully support the government’s objective to drastically reduce unnecessary single-use plastic.

“We are pleased that the government has recognised the genuine need of some of our customers, with today’s announcement exempting hospitality venues, by allowing straws for customers upon request, which is a practice that the sector was rapidly implementing or moving towards.

“The hospitality sector has voluntarily made significant progress in reducing the availability and use of plastic straws and stirrers, motivated both by a moral duty and our customers’ environmental concerns.”

In England, it is estimated that 4.7 billion plastic straws and 316 million plastic stirrers are used every year. Even though non-plastic alternatives are readily available, it is estimated that 95% of straws are still plastic.

It is thought to take hundreds of years to break down the single-use plastic items and cleaning up their effects costs the government millions of pounds each year.

Environment secretary Michael Gove said: “Urgent and decisive action is needed to tackle plastic pollution and protect our environment.

“These items are often used for just a few minutes but take hundreds of years to break down, ending up in our seas and oceans and harming precious marine life.

“So today I am taking action to turn the tide on plastic pollution, and ensure we leave our environment in a better state for future generations.”

The ban follows a number of firms who have already moved to tackle plastic straw use.

Drinks giants Diageo, Pernod Ricard and Bacardi have also committed to stop using plastic straws and stirrers across their businesses, while drinks industry group the Scotch Whisky Association has pledged its support as part of its Environmental Strategy.

In September 2017, British pub chain JD Wetherspoon promised to ditch plastic straws across its 900-plus pubs in the UK and Republic of Ireland by the end of 2018.

The Deltic Group, the UK’s largest operator of late-night bars and nightclubs, removed plastic straws from its venues as part of its #nostrawsattached campaign.",UK government to ban plastic straws next year

The new experience, called Martell the Journey, aims to explore the brand’s 300-year history, from its creation by Jean Martell in 1715 to the present day.

Developed by exhibition designer Nathalie Crinière, the experience follows three themes: Heritage; Savoir-Faire, meaning knowledge; and Part des Anges, which means the angels’ share.

Through the Heritage pathway, visitors trace the history of the brand through archive material demonstrating its inception at the Gâtebourse site and the nine generations of Martell family that have lead the brand since.

In the Savoir-Faire section, visitors will be able the witness the people and skills essential to the production of Martell Cognac, while Part des Anges is a multi-sensory installation that allows Cognac fans to explore the spirit in an “entirely original way”.

The visitor experience incorporates video animations, interactive installations and 360° projections. Martell experts will also be on-hand to answer questions and share additional information and anecdotes.

As part of Martell the Journey, visitors will be able to “rise above the rooftops of Cognac” through an immersive video experience that illustrates the region’s landscape and characteristics.

After this exploration, visitors will be invited into former Cognac cellars to view life-size video installations of a winegrower, distiller and cooper, who each discuss their influence on the finished Martell Cognac.

The figures from Nielsen Scantrack measured off-premise outlets for the 52 weeks ended 20 April 2019.

Malt-based cocktails led the growth of the category, with annual sales now accounting for US$4.7 million. Spirit- and wine-based RTD cocktails generated larger annual sales at US$62m and US$83m respectively.

Nielsen said the RTD growth was boosted by brands “experimenting with new and interesting flavours that haven’t historically been available away from the bar”.

Within hard seltzers, the top flavour is the ‘assorted’ option, showing that consumers are looking for more choice, Nielsen claimed.

The packaging of RTDs has “broadened the scope for how alcoholic beverages have traditionally been contained” with the can format “performing particularly well”.

When it comes to generations, Nielsen said that young adults are moving towards RTD cocktails at social gathering and outdoor activities. Popular RTD occasions include outdoor picnics (32%), the beach/pool (28%) and while travelling or on holiday (23%).

RTD cocktails taps into consumer demand for convenience and provides drinkers “with something they’ve historically had to be at a bar or restaurant to enjoy”.

These newer alcohol segments are “providing expansion opportunities” across the alcohol category, Nielsen claimed. This can be demonstrated in a number of ways including new entrepreneurial companies introducing their brands to the market, existing companies acquiring other brand(s), and existing brands in single alcohol segments extending their name recognition into newer segments to try and become a ‘power’ brand.",Spirit-based RTD growth up 40%

Speaking to The Spirits Business last month, John Kennedy addressed the issue of whether the influx of independent super-premium brands has the potential to significantly erode the market share of large players.

But according to Kennedy, the speed of which companies react to trends is more important than their size.

He explained: “The markets are changing so fast that if you’re on it you’ll win, but if you’re too slow to react – no matter how big or strong you are – you’ll be beaten.”

Kennedy used Gordon’s Premium Pink as an example. Launched in 2017, the iteration is flavoured with raspberry, strawberry and redcurrant. According to Kennedy, the gin is “one of the biggest spirits launches in Europe in many years”.

He added: “Pink gin was a trend that we spotted in southern Spain and realised it could spread to the rest of Europe. So we said: why don’t we get our answer to it and why don’t we get it out to 54 countries in the next six months?

“We have to move fast – if you don’t you’re going to be beaten, no matter what competitive advantage you have.”

A careful approach to innovation has allowed Diageo to deliver a “good, consistent, sustainable performance” globally over the last few years, according to Kennedy.

In its first-half results for 2018/19, Diageo reported an organic net sales increase of 7.5% to £6.9 billion, bolstered by Tequila and gin.

At an investors’ conference earlier this week, Diageo CEO Ivan Menezes reiterated the firm’s guidance of delivering organic net sales growth “towards the upper end of our mid-single digit range”, and organic operating profit “ahead of net sales” at 5-7%.

Following years of negotiations, the 28 EU member states settled on the updated set of regulations at the end of last year.

These regulations have been published in the EU’s Official Journal today (17 May). The majority of the new rules will be applicable from 25 May 2021, while certain provisions on geographical indications (GIs) will apply from 31 May 2019.

Trade body the Irish Spirits Association (ISA) has welcomed the adoption of the new laws, claiming they “will ensure better protection for Irish whiskey, Irish cream and Poitín into the future”.

The regulations will see “an increase in the harmonisation of standards across the EU”, in addition to “clearer and more consistent” labelling for spirits.

GI statuses will also benefit from an additional seven years of protection, while “more traditional production methods” will also be preserved, which is expected “to clamp down on fake GI spirits”.

Vincent McGovern, head of ISA, said: “Ireland’s spirits industry is an important and growing indigenous sector, with products that stand out on the global stage as a result of their heritage, quality and authenticity.

“With growth anticipated to continue, increased protection for our spirits industry is very important and these new EU rules really help.

“While benefitting Irish producers, the new rules will also be good for consumers, who will be better able to make informed choices, as there will be more uniform labelling requirements across the EU.”

The ISA has been involved in a two-year lobbying campaign to improve the regulations for spirits, tackling laws that “undermined Irish GIs”.",New EU spirits regulations come into force

Building on the WSET’s Level 2 Award in Spirits, the course will cover a “broader spectrum of world spirits”, including shōchū, baijiu and soju, and will “provide greater detail” on production processes in spirits and their impact on style and quality.

The course, which requires a minimum of 84 hours of study time, will offer “in-depth coverage” of the Scotch, Cognac, Armagnac, Caribbean rum, Tequila, mezcal, vodka and gin categories.

The exam will include a blind tasting and written paper comprising multiple choice and short written answers. The course is being led by Nick King, WSET product development manager, spirits and sake.

He said: “The spirits industry has been crying out for a more advanced qualification in spirits. Candidate numbers for WSET spirits qualifications (Levels 1 and 2) have grown significantly in the last 10 years, from 540 in 2009 to 6,600 in 2019, and are now taught in 33 countries worldwide, reflecting growing global demand.

“We are delighted to now be able to offer the industry a Level 3 Spirits qualification that develops candidates’ knowledge and understanding of the category in great depth and also builds their tasting skills, teaching them to identify the structural and aromatic elements that make up a spirit and to make a compelling quality assessment.”

The WSET recommends that Level 3 candidates first complete the Level 2 Award in Spirits.

The Level 3 Award will take place at WSET’s London school on 21-26 October 2019, 10-15 February 2020, and 22-27 June 2020.

WSET’s Chicago school in the US will hold the course on 26-31 August 2019, its Las Vegas outpost on 4-9 November 2019, and its New Orleans office on 20-25 April 2020.

In the 2017/18 academic year, the WSET witnessed a 21% increase in diploma graduates, who collectively hailed from more than 40 countries. The WSET celebrates its 50th anniversary this year.",WSET ‘advanced’ spirits course goes live
"The volume growth of spirits slowed in 2018 as vodka experienced its sixth consecutive year of decline, according to new data from market research provider Euromonitor.",20 May 2019,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/media/2018/09/spirits-duty-freeze.jpg,https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2019/05/spirits-underperform-total-alcohol-volume-growth/,"The volume growth of spirits slowed in 2018 as vodka experienced its sixth consecutive year of decline, according to new data from market research provider Euromonitor.

In the 2018 calendar year, total global alcohol volume consumption grew by 1.6% to 253.9 billion litres, compared to 250bn litres in 2017. In terms of spirits, volume grew by 1.1% to 21.7bn litres, while growth in 2017 was +1.3% to 21.5bn litres.

The spirits category was hit by vodka’s sixth consecutive year of decline, according to Spiros Malandrakis, head of alcoholic drinks research at Euromonitor. In 2018, the category registered a marginal volume drop of 0.5%.

“Vodka appears to be still languishing in a state of perma-limbo with volume sales essentially flat or posting minor overall declines while remaining in negative territory for the sixth consecutive year,” said Malandrakis.

“Despite the fact that the juggernaut that is Tito’s continues motoring on, it remains a white knight in the sea of gloom and overwhelming, cyclical maturity, otherwise engulfing this most ubiquitous of white spirits.”

However, the spirits sector was boosted by a number of strong performers in 2018, notably Tequila (+7% by volume) and English gin (+9%).

According to Malandrakis, both categories “continue [to capitalise] on their artisanal credentials, uninhibited embrace of premiumisation undercurrents and the flurry of innovation fuelling their momentum”.

Irish whiskey, meanwhile, “retains its enviable trajectory” and posted volume growth of 9% in 2018.

Bourbon was “another star performer” in the alcoholic drinks market last year and reported a 5% volume lift, despite the international trade spat that has embroiled the category in a web of retaliatory tariffs.

Beer volume was up 1.3% in the year, despite “fierce” competition for mindshare in the key US market. Meanwhile, white wine volume “flatlined” and red wine volume slumped by more than 1%.

While these figures refer to volume sales, value sales for spirits are more heartening and are forecast to hit US$366bn in 2022, according to a joint report from Vinexpo and the IWSR. This would mark a 14.9% increase from 2017.",Spirits volume growth slower than total alcohol
