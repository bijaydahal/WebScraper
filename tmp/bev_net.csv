Under the precise guidance of our master distiller Miguel Cedeño Cruz, DeLeón Añejo defies the conventions of the category to establish the next level in Tequila. This full-bodied Tequila is made from our finest 100 percent Highland Blue Weber agave sourced from the rich earth of the Los Altos region of Jalisco, each plant is hand-selected at harvest for ripeness to deliver the sweetest piñas. Once selected, the agave is slow roasted in uniform pieces in traditional brick and clay ovens. Combined with slow fermentation, the liquid develops rich depth and complexity, creating a remarkably nuanced character.

With relentless attention to detail our master distiller artfully cuts the beginning and end of the distillation, allowing only the absolute best portion, or Corazon, to find its way into every bottle. The liquid is artfully aged first in bold American oak barrels and finished in French wine casks to impart a distinctive, balanced character, taking the final product to the next level. The result is a full-bodied tequila with notes of rich vanilla, caramel, sweet oak and subtle dried fruit.",DeLeón Tequila Launches Añejo Reserve

Cannabidiol (CBD) retailer Ceres Natural Remedies announced on Tuesday it has acquired maple water maker Tretap for an undisclosed sum.,2019-02-7,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/08164654/ceres-update_full-width_2.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/ceres-natural-products-acquires-tretap,"Cannabidiol (CBD) retailer Ceres Natural Remedies announced on Tuesday it has acquired maple water maker Tretap for an undisclosed sum.

Speaking with BevNET, Ceres executive director Shayne Lynn said the two Vermont-based companies came together last year when Tretap began exploring the CBD beverage space. Ceres, which has multiple retail locations throughout Vermont, is vertically integrated with medical cannabis cultivator and dispensary Southern Vermont Wellness. According to Lynn, the company produces several of its own CBD products under the Ceres brand name, including oils and edibles, but did not previously have a beverage in its portfolio.

Working with Tretap founder and president Aaron Harris, Ceres will launch a line of sparkling CBD-infused maple waters under the Tretap name. The of four SKUs is set to launch later this month, with additional varieties planned to launch this summer.

“We really have a nice brand of products now, and this drink category fits with the other products we’re developing under Ceres, so it’s going to be a really nice package altogether,” Lynn said. “One of the most exciting things about going out on the road, talking to people and saying hey we have this suitcase of products all under one brand and we’re looking for Tretap to really be the anchor for all those other products.”

Harris told BevNET his focus is to grow distribution for both Tretap, available throughout New England, and Ceres branded products, which are currently available in Vermont. While the space for tree-sourced waters, such as maple or birch, is still nascent, Harris said CBD is an extra selling point for many distributors and retailers, with multiple buyers expressing interest in carrying Tretap’s original and CBD-infused products.

The company is also exploring launching additional CBD-infused maple products under the Tretap banner, Harris said, but there are no immediate plans for non-beverage lines.

“We don’t have any short-term plans but there’s been a lot of discussion about how do we extend the brand,” Harris said. “It’s definitely something we’re thinking about right now but we have a lot going on just with our existing portfolio at Tretap and our existing portfolio at Ceres that we’re really excited to bring to market.”

The announcement of the acquisition comes just days after state and city officials in Maine and New York began crackdowns on businesses selling CBD food and beverage products. Lynn said Ceres works closely with the Vermont Departments of Health and Agriculture and is in frequent contact with regulator to ensure the company is following all legal requirements.

“We’re really looking for our agriculture department to come forward, confirm their program with the USDA and say they meet all the standards in the Farm Bill and that’s going to take some time, but we’re confident in the short term that we’re following all the rules and regulations here in the state of Vermont.” Lynn said. “It can be a little bit of a dance when you have this whole new industry is coming about. But I think we have the experience to handle that.”",Ceres Natural Remedies Acquires Tretap
"A lot of people think that Terrell Davis’ NFL career ended too soon, forced out by knee injuries after just eight years. They were unquestionably great ones, as he was elected to the league’s Hall of Fame.",2019-02-8,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/07164032/DEFY_Full-Width_1.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/cbd-sports-wellness-beverages-emerge-as-possible-new-category,"A lot of people think that Terrell Davis’ NFL career ended too soon, forced out by knee injuries after just eight years. They were unquestionably great ones, as he was elected to the league’s Hall of Fame.

But chronic pain followed him into retirement. After using prescription medication for some time, he feared that long-term use could damage his kidneys and decided to seek an all-natural pain reliever. When Davis tried CBD — cannabidiol, the non-psychoactive cannabis derivative — he claimed it transformed his body; not only did his joints feel looser but, after struggling with migraines since childhood, he said he has not experienced any in over a year.

Now Davis is the co-founder of Defy, a CBD-infused sports drink set to launch in three flavors this spring.

“It just was a real eye-opener to me how it affected my body,” said Davis. “I was like ‘Wow, we’ve got to do something with this. We’ve got to be able to share this with other people who were like me, who didn’t know it was so effective.’’”

Davis isn’t the only athlete-turned-entrepreneur in a sharing mood.

CBD seems to be the functional ingredient of the moment, with new infused beverages — from kombuchas to seltzers to millennial-aimed elixirs — popping up with increasing frequency, especially since the 2018 Farm Bill legalized industrial hemp. Sports drinks are emerging as one of the main established categories facing disruption by the new ingredient, as a new wave of brands aims to expand the sports drink category and its ability to deliver a range of physical and mental benefits to athletes, and amateurs and pros are getting into the game.

Take Jim Bailey, the CEO of OKI, an active hemp extract water, fruit water and iced tea brand launching this spring. He created the company after he was hit by a car while riding his bike. Recovering after surgery, he sought out a natural pain reliever rather than continuing to take prescribed opiates from his surgeon, and found that active hemp extract — which contains CBD — helped him bounce back quickly.

Bailey said since entering this beverage space, he has noticed a building anticipation surrounding such products, comparing this hype to his experience working on the team that launched Red Bull in Canada. “The demand for it is like nothing I’ve ever seen,” he said. According to Bloomberg, analysts at market research group Canaccord Genuity expect the CBD-infused beverage market to reach $260 million by 2022.

Defy co-founder and CEO Beau Wehrle similarly emphasized the product’s potential use as a natural treatment for injuries.

“A lot of the alternatives aren’t a solution, they’re a Band-Aid that might temporarily fix the problem,” said Wehrle. “On the flip side, there are consequences that could impair your health or even worse.”

One of Defy’s primary goals, Davis noted, is to provide an alternative to treating chronic pain and anxiety with addictive painkillers, helping to fight the opioid abuse problem in sports. According to a study by the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, retired NFL players use painkillers four times more than the general population, with 71 percent of these players meeting the criteria for opioid misuse.

“I’m really looking and envisioning that there’s a time when CBD becomes the solution to what they’re already doing right now in professional sports,” Davis said.

Aethics, which markets H20 Balance: CBD Water for Sports, was founded with a similar goal in mind. Co-founders Glenn Dooley and Brad Wyatt, both athletes and coaches, launched the brand in January after noticing a void in the sports wellness space and exploring CBD’s potential as a pain management alternative to prescription and over-the-counter medication.

“We saw a natural solution to address many of the issues that those medications were intended to resolve,” said Aethics general manager Matt Olenski. “And that’s a big part of why individuals gravitate to CBD products.”

While this nascent category may be generating buzz, hemp-derived sports beverages still remain a fairly new concept for consumers and uncharted territory for companies, and these brands face challenges in the marketplace both in ensuring the quality of their products and educating consumers about how CBD’s effects differ from those of THC.

According to Bailey, OKI purposely did not put CBD in their product due to advice they received from Hoban Law Group, a Denver-based cannabis business law firm. In order to be “compliant with the FDA,” it instead uses active hemp extract, which Bailey claimed to be the “exact same thing.” However, in researching CPG consumer data, it found that public awareness for hemp was even less than that of CBD. He said that the first question people often ask him is if OKI provides a euphoric effect.

“I tell people this feeling of balance, of centeredness, both physically and emotionally,” he said.

For Aethics, the solution to the lack of consumer knowledge is transparency. Aethics gets its name from a fusion of the words “athletics” and “ethics,” with the ethics portion stemming from the company being what Olenski describes as “seed-to-sale.” Five years ago, the company launched Strasburg Pharms, where they grow organic, chemical- and pesticide-free industrial hemp, allowing them to control creation and delivery of their products.

Defy’s founders were also concerned with delivering a quality, THC-free product. “The delta of what I would consider bad CBD and great CBD is exponential,” said Wehrle. “We did extensive due diligence and met with hundreds and hundreds of people to finally find the right partner who can actually deliver what they’ve promised.”

Despite rising interest in CBD’s athletic applications, the NFL, like most other professional sports leagues, has not changed its policies banning athletes from using CBD, despite the World Anti-Doping Association having removed it from its list of banned substances in 2017. However, a few leagues and sports figures have worked to push the ball forward. In June of 2018, the BIG3 basketball league became the first professional sports league in the country to allow its players to use CBD.

Besides Davis, the hemp and cannabis industries have also attracted other influential ex-sports stars as entrepreneurs. Joe Montana, the iconic former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, recently participated in a $75 million investment in California-based cannabis company Caliva, while former undisputed heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, who is also a partner in a “cannabis ranch” compound in California, briefly entered the CBD sports beverage space with the hemp-infused flavored water TKO Powered By Tyson.

A possible obstacle to sports leagues’ — and many consumers’ — widespread acceptance of CBD is the lack of scientific research available regarding its health benefits, which has forced brands to conduct their own research to determine the amount of CBD or active hemp extract they deemed an effective dosage for athletes.

“Based upon our research with a number of scientific partners, we’ve identified 20 mg of CBD as the ideal dosage for our beverage due to its anti-inflammation properties for this audience,” said Defy COO Megan Bushell in an email.

After initially settling on a 10 mg dose, OKI later also determined 20 mg of hemp extract would be the most effective amount for its products after conducting consumer research and consulting a doctor on its advisory board.

According to Olenski, the Aethics team arrived at 12 mg of CBD for their water after testing on an audience and themselves. The CBD water even has a dosage on the bottle tracker to provide reference for consumers. For Aethics, taste was also of concern when determining the amount of CBD to use in its unflavored infused water.

“There is a balance between how much CBD you can include in the water relative to the water’s taste and odor, so you want to find that balance between a really clear crisp flavor, especially in a clear water, and the amount of CBD included in the water,” Olensky said.

Wehrle and Bailey both claimed that Defy and OKI are suitable for both pre- and post-workout hydration, while Olensky stated that consumers mostly use its CBD water product for post-workout recovery.

Though these hemp-derived products were formulated to aid athletic performance and recovery, the companies have also expressed interest in proving CBD’s other functional benefits. Olenski noted that, in addition to inflammation and pain relief, benefits of Aethics products include relief from anxiety and insomnia. The brand also sells non-beverage products such as CBD Muscle Rescue Lotion. After the release of its flagship sports drink, Defy plans to release a lifestyle beverage containing less CBD that is focused on “defying your everyday” and “performing in life,” according to Wehrle. OKI plans to lean into an “aspirational lifestyle” aesthetic, Bailey said, with “vibrant” and “playful” marketing campaigns that still focus on educating consumers on the benefits of using active hemp extract.

With Aethics on the market for only a few weeks, and Defy and OKI’s launches coming this spring, it has yet to be seen how the emerging category of sports wellness products will be received by its audience.

Terrell Davis, however, is confident in the potential for CBD. “It is the most transformative ingredient in the last decade.”",CBD Sports Wellness Beverages Emerge as Possible New Category

PathWater has combined a reusable bottle with purified reverse osmosis water. Visionary Vernon Davis sees this sustainability model as the future for bottled water. After years of witnessing single-use plastics plague the NFL, Davis is taking a stand to educate his fellow teammates on a better path for the league.

“We (athletes) have a huge responsibility. We are looked at as leaders in our community and within our fan base. If we can use that influence to encourage our fans to make greener choices we can be the catalyst for great change,” said Davis.

As the current tight end for the Washington Redskins, Davis has joined yet another winning team, PathWater. After meeting the founders, Vernon quickly aligned with the mission and became part of a growing movement of sustainable investing. “I think they (single-use plastic water bottles) are a tremendous waste,” said Davis. “After meeting with PathWater and learning more about how the tremendous amounts of plastic we dispose of daily destroy our oceans, it upset me.”

Davis has charged forward with the purpose to end single-use plastic waste on football fields and school campuses across the U.S. Visiting schools and speaking at rallies, Davis is using his influence to educate youth about the harms of single-use plastic water bottles and the solution, a movement for reusability. In a recent visit to Sequoia High School, he encouraged students to BAN single-use plastic water bottles at their campus by signing this petition.

PathWater and Davis believe it is important for youth to know what single-use plastic is made of and how destructive it has become to ocean life and human health. Davis, a father of three, said, “You know when you become a parent, you start thinking about the next 100 years rather than the next 40 or 50, which makes up your estimated lifespan. You think about the future of your kids and their kids. It gives me an even greater sense of responsibility to do what I can to leave this earth better than it was when I was born.”

PathWater is the new hybrid, combining the best in purified water with a BPA-free, infinitely reusable bottle. The PathWater bottle is solving the dilemma of single-use plastic bottles by creating a superior option that is environmentally friendly. When taken from the refrigerator section, the bottle makes for an extremely cold drinking experience, unmatched by plastic water bottles. PathWater is on a dedicated mission to provide solutions to the plastics crisis for bottled water consumers and to disrupt the beverage industry as a whole. PathWater’s three main goals are: to provide a sustainable option to reduce and reuse; to educate others about the plastics crisis; and to change a stagnant, polluting industry of single-use plastics. PathWater is the first in the beverage industry to offer reusable packaging bottled water that finally puts people and the planet before profits.

“Recycooler gives companies a unique way to tell their brand story and build brand equity with consumers,” said Chad Wagner, president and CEO of Peachtree Packaging. “In a world where so many experiential packaging and display options are disposable, we are excited to provide an exciting, memorable customer experience that also provides consumers with a functional useful tool that they can feel good about using.”

Recycooler coolers can be custom printed and are completely brandable, making them ideal for merchandising and shipping branded products or using as promotional giveaways and product launches. Recycooler also offers an option for cold shipping products that must remain chilled upon arrival.

“Recycooler fits well into our product line by providing our clients with yet another unique unboxing and experiential packaging solution. With Recycooler, you are not only providing consumers with a high-quality eco-friendly product, but it also serves as a visible, functional marketing piece for your brand that will be seen throughout the community, creating multiple lasting impressions,” said Pete Galbiati, director of marketing for Peachtree Packaging.

The patented design of a Recycooler comprises a unique insulation component that is superior for keeping drinks and food cold for long periods of time, even in the hottest conditions. Recycooler is a more environmentally conscious choice than traditional polystyrene coolers, which introduce unnecessary waste into the environment after a very brief use-life. Polystyrene also causes problems in the earth’s hydrosphere as animals can swallow or choke on it. In addition, an impartial working group under the auspices of the World Health Organization and appointed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has upgraded its warning regarding Styrene as “possibly carcinogenic” to “probably carcinogenic for humans.”

Recycoolers are customizable and can be used for private label branded products, promotional giveaways or fundraising products. Recycooler’s water resistant, eco-friendly coating stands up to multiple uses while creatively advertising at the same time. Recycoolers are not only more eco-friendly, but they are also more durable than polystyrene coolers and will not crack or leak like traditional polystyrene coolers.

Recycoolers are made in America, printed with environmentally friendly soy-based ink, contain a minimum of 60 percent post-consumer content and are recyclable. Recycool, Inc. manufactures each with a fully insulated lid and sides to keep food and beverages cool or warm for hours.

“Our mission is to create a recyclable, disposable cooler that meets every green consumer’s demands, including using the greenest materials available,” said Kevin Bentley, president and CEO of Recycool, Inc. “Peachtree Packaging is the ideal exclusive manufacturer for Recycoolers with its expertise in unique experiential packaging solutions and custom product displays that are proven to drive revenue.”

"– Located in the rolling hills of northern Vermont, Caledonia Spirits – the distiller of Barr Hill Gin, Barr Hill Vodka and Tom Cat Gin – is expertly crafting some of the most unique, super-premium spirits in the country, and it is doing so with raw northern honey as the backbone of every bottle.",2019-02-6,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/06121715/7bc83e14d3a534711564.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/spirits/2019/caledonia-spirits-introduces-barr-hill-vodka-and-gin/,"HARDWICK, Vt.– Located in the rolling hills of northern Vermont, Caledonia Spirits – the distiller of Barr Hill Gin, Barr Hill Vodka and Tom Cat Gin – is expertly crafting some of the most unique, super-premium spirits in the country, and it is doing so with raw northern honey as the backbone of every bottle.

Founded in 2009 by Todd Hardie, a local beekeeper and farmer, Caledonia Spirits set out to create a gin unlike any other, blending raw northern honey with juniper to achieve a perfect balance of flavor. With quality ingredients and a connection to the land, the Barr Hill brand was born – and so was its landcrafted approach, which is at the core of everything the distillery does to this day.

Now under the leadership of owner and head distiller Ryan Christiansen, who purchased the company in 2015, a growing team of hardworking Vermonters is carrying forward Caledonia Spirits’ original mission of building strong relationships with local farmers and beekeepers, creating quality jobs in the area and raising awareness about the importance of bees and other pollinators. In fact, each September, Caledonia Spirits hosts Bee’s Knees Week, a philanthropic initiative that engages bars and restaurants across the country to raise awareness of the essential role that bees play in our environment.

Built on a foundation of innovation and experimentation, Caledonia Spirits is pushing the boundaries of traditional distilling with its Barr Hill spirits. The distillery currently produces three truly unique, award-winning spirits for commercial distribution and is in the process of developing additional large-scale and limited-release spirits.

“Distillation is an agricultural opportunity,” Christiansen said. “It takes a long journey to deliver a labeled bottle onto a shelf, and no single step is more important than the previous. We strive to take care of our farmers, our flowers, our soil, and our waterways. It’s the acceptance of our responsibilities as distillers that elevates our spirits.”

Barr Hill Gin, the distillery’s flagship spirit, is the country’s fastest-growing domestically produced super-premium gin. A winner of 12 gold (or higher) medals, Barr Hill Gin celebrates the hard-working bees of the Northeast. The gin is distilled in Barr Hill’s custom-built botanical extraction still – named Irene, after the lead distiller’s late grandmother – and the floral depth of the raw honey acts to balance out the juniper-forward botanicals. The unique recipe and distilling process produces a gin with a distinctive, unparalleled flavor profile, as well as a beautiful golden hue from the honey.

Thanks to a six-month aging process in new American white oak barrels, BarrHill’s Tom Cat Gin is a revolutionary spirit that marries the best qualities of gin and whiskey. The robust character of the oak barrels mingles with the coniferous quality of the juniper to produce a wonderfully approachable spirit that can be enjoyed on its own or in a cocktail. Tom Cat Gin, which still features a touch of raw northern honey like Barr Hill’s other spirits, is the country’s top-selling barrel-aged gin.

Rounding out the distillery’s current product line is Barr Hill Vodka, a truly extraordinary take on the widely popular spirit. Distilled solely from raw northern honey, the vodka is a tribute to the hardworking beekeepers who deliver hundreds of barrels of honey to Caledonia Spirits every summer. Since the spirit comes entirely from impeccably-flavored raw northern honey and not a cheaper sugar source like potato, Barr Hill Vodka is minimally distilled and filtered, unlike traditional vodkas. The end result is an exceptional spirit that is both flavorful and fragrant.

Managing all of its production in-house, Barr Hill can be found in stores, bars, and restaurants across 26 states, from coast to coast, and is also available by special order in an additional six states. On a global level, the spirits are distributed to Puerto Rico, Canada (Quebec), Denmark, Hong Kong and Japan. For online ordering or a full list of retail availability, visit the “Find Us” page on the distillery’s website, barrhill.com.

Every bottle of Barr Hill comes sealed with real beeswax and features both the hand-written batch number and production year on the back of the label. Barr Hill’s website is an excellent resource for delicious cocktail recipes, and it’s also home to an online shop that features its very own raw northern honey, branded apparel and barware. At the distillery in Hardwick, Vermont, tours and tastings are available, Tuesday through Saturday, between 12 and 5 p.m.

To keep up with demand and ensure all production stays in-house, Caledonia Spirits will move into a state-of-the-art, 26,000-square-foot distillery in Montpelier this spring.

Barr Hill is an award-winning, super-premium spirits brand, made by the Vermont-based distillery, Caledonia Spirits. The distillery proudly operates under its Landcrafted philosophy, skillfully and mindfully crafting its spirits with environmental stewardship in mind. Barr Hill currently produces three spirits – Barr Hill Gin, Tom Cat Gin and Barr Hill Vodka – and distributes to 32 states, along with Puerto Rico, Canada (Quebec), Denmark, Hong Kong and Japan. The spirits are also available in another six states by special order.

TAJA’s patented cold-filtered three-part process extracts the coconut water while keeping all the nutrients intact by avoiding the application of harmful heat, air or additives. Created with a commitment to let the world taste coconut water the way nature intended, TAJA harvests each coconut at the perfect age to deliver a balanced flavor and crystal-clear color.

“Growing up in a tropical country I was lucky enough to experience the joyful taste of pure and fresh coconut water straight from the tree, but as the drink started to gain popularity in the U.S. I was disappointed to discover that none of the products I tasted came close the the coconut water that I grew up loving,” explained TAJA’s Founder Nilang Patel. “So I set out to fix this problem, and after a few years of research, investigation, and taste testing, I developed a technology that allows coconut water to remain exactly as nature intended—raw, clean and pure.”

TAJA works with local coconut tree farmers to help neutralize and improve each coconut’s soil condition. Within 48 hours of being picked, TAJA’s coconuts are delivered to their factory and bottled using their patented cold-filtered process. TAJA is also committed to sustainability, minimizing waste by grinding the empty coconut shells into compost for organic fertilizer that is then used to grow more coconut trees.

“Though our process isn’t the easiest way to harvest coconut water, purity is at the heart of everything we do, and we are dedicated to taking every step necessary to preserve all the nutrients of the natural nut and most importantly, its true taste,” said Hallie Lorber, president of TAJA. “The decision behind our clear bottles highlights our commitment toward 100 percent transparency to consumers and to delivering the freshest coconut water possible.”

TAJA is available for purchase online and at select retail stores throughout the Midwest with plans of expanding nationally in the near future. Pricing on individual bottles vary from $3.49 to $3.99 and are sold in cases of 12 for $53.99. TAJA invites consumers to leave behind the fake coconut waters they have grown accustomed to in the past and taste the TAJA difference.

TAJA Coconut is the world’s first all-natural, cold-filtered coconut water. It is produced using a three-part process that harvests each coconut at the perfect age to deliver a balanced flavor and crystal-clear color. The patented cold-filtered process extracts the coconut water while keeping all the nutrients intact without having to add harmful heat, air or additives. The result: a better-tasting and better-for-you coconut water. To learn more about TAJA visit tajacoconut.com.",TAJA Coconut Launches Coconut Water

The Ole Smoky Moonshine Holler in Gatlinburg welcomed over 2 million visitors; Gatlinburg’s Ole Smoky Whiskey Barrelhouse welcomed over 900,000; and the company’s Pigeon Forge distillery, The Barn, welcomed 1.1 million.

By comparison, Ole Smoky entertains more than twice as many guests as all of Scotland’s distilleries combined. According to publicly available data, Scotland’s 74 whiskey distilleries saw 1.9 million attendees in 2017. Ole Smoky’s 4.1 million visitors is also more than three times the 1.2 million people who visit the Kentucky Bourbon Trail’s 10 distilleries each year.

Each Ole Smoky distillery location includes working stills and fermentation tanks and an expansive visitor experience, including self-guided tours, tastings, live music and large retail shops featuring Ole Smoky moonshine, whiskey, apparel, accessories and food.

Named the largest craft distiller in the U.S. by the IWSR, Ole Smoky Moonshine is also the No. 1 selling moonshine brand in the world and Nielsen indicates that Ole Smoky’s market share is over twice that of its nearest competitor.

“Our impressive visitor numbers speak not only to the attraction of the greater Smoky Mountain area, but also to the focused attention we’ve placed on the entire distillery visitor experience. From the quality and variety of our moonshine and whiskey products, to our attractive merchandise and live music, we want visitors to experience the full spectrum of our ‘C’Mon Live a Little’ motto,” explained Robert Hall, CEO of Ole Smoky Distillery LLC. “It’s great to see people visiting and enjoying Gatlinburg and the surrounding area. We look forward to introducing even more visitors to the Ole Smoky experience when our Nashville location opens later this year.”

Ole Smoky is the leading distiller of premium moonshine in the world and the first federally licensed distillery in the history of East Tennessee. Founded in 2010, Ole Smoky’s roots can be traced to the Smoky Mountains’ earliest settlers, families who produced moonshine with enduring pride and Appalachian spirit. In 2009, Tennessee laws changed, and suddenly, it was legal to make, distill and sell the infamous and illicit moonshine the region had become known for — and Ole Smoky was born, with products crafted from a century-old recipe. In 2016, Ole Smoky debuted its line of premium whiskeys, many of which have been launched nationally. Today, Ole Smoky retails globally and offers more than 25 creative moonshine flavors and 17 inventive whiskey flavors. Ole Smoky can be found at the company’s distilleries, online, in grocery and liquor stores nationwide, as well as in on-premise establishments, including some of the biggest music and sporting venues in the country. The Ole Smoky product line also includes a wide array of branded apparel, gifts, accessories, plus whiskey- and moonshine-flavored food items, including barbecue sauces, hot sauces and dips. Ole Smoky distilleries are the most visited in the world. Each year, more than four million people visit Ole Smoky’s three famed East Tennessee distilleries: The Holler, The Barrelhouse and The Barn. In 2019, Ole Smoky will open a fourth location in Nashville.

"The Coca-Cola Company announced last week its first flavor extension for the flagship line in 12 years: Orange Vanilla, available in original Coke and Coke Zero Sugar varieties, launching nationwide this month.",2019-02-11,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/11174658/CocaCola_orangevanilla_fullwidth.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/coke-continues-innovation-streak-with-orange-vanilla-launch,"The Coca-Cola Company announced last week its first flavor extension for the flagship line in 12 years: Orange Vanilla, available in original Coke and Coke Zero Sugar varieties, launching nationwide this month.

The flavor extension is one of several recent innovations for Coke’s core CSD products over the past two years, a streak which started with the rebranding of Coca-Cola Zero as Coke Zero Sugar in 2017. Last year, the company relaunched Diet Coke with new packaging and four new flavors, and most recently in January announced additional Blueberry Acai and Strawberry Guava Diet Coke flavors. Orange Vanilla is the first new trademark Coca-Cola flavor since Vanilla Coke launched in 2007.

In an email to BevNET, Coca-Cola brand director Kate Carpenter said the move reflects a growing demand for choice and variety among consumers, and is a component of the company’s transition into a “Total Beverage Company.”

“We know consumers have options and crave variety in all facets of their lives – from technology to food and beverages,” Carpenter wrote. “We are launching Orange Vanilla Coke and the Zero Sugar counterpart to appeal to people who want choice. Fans can now satisfy their craving for variety, while still enjoying the delicious Coca-Cola taste they know and love.”

According to an announcement on the company’s website, Vanilla Coke and Cherry Coke have seen significant growth in recent years despite little marketing. However, only 12 percent of Coca-Cola consumers are purchasing flavored Coke products and are instead choosing other brands.

“When we looked across our Sparkling portfolio, we strategically decided to bring multiple new products and new flavors to market this year,” Carpenter told BevNET. “People’s taste preferences and lifestyles are changing, so we’re evolving our portfolio to provide authentic beverage experiences to meet those needs.”

Both Orange Vanilla Coke and Orange Vanilla Coke Zero Sugar will launch on February 25 in 12 oz. and 20 oz. PET bottles. The flavors will also be available in a limited run in promotional 12 oz. cans, and will be exclusively available for fountain service through its Coca-Cola Freestyle machines in Wendy’s restaurants through the end of March before expanding in its Freestyle locations nationwide. The launch will also be supported with a full marketing campaign with television, social, digital, mobile, radio, and experiential ads, in addition to a tie-in promotion with the NCAA March Madness men’s college basketball tournament.

While the company has not announced additional flavors, it has tested raspberry, lemon, and ginger flavors with consumers. According to Campbell, the company is continuing to explore new innovations “that appeal to a wide array of tastes and lifestyles.”

The launch comes as Coke explores innovation opportunities in other areas of its beverage portfolio, including a restructuring of its Venturing and Emerging Brands unit (VEB) announced in December which will include a tighter focus on innovation and will position the unit as an “in-house accelerator” that can quickly grow emerging brands.

“Flavor innovations are a growth driver for Coca-Cola Trademark and drive excitement around our brand,” she said. “So while we are currently focused on the launch of Orange Vanilla Coke and Orange Vanilla Coke Zero Sugar, we are open to more new flavors and innovations in the future.”",Coke Continues Innovation Streak with Orange Vanilla Launch

" In a move toward diversifying its portfolio and reaching spirits consumers, Goodwood Brewing Co. announced a foray into the crafts spirits space with the launch of a Premium Bourbon aged in stout barrels.",2019-02-12,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/12113752/unnamed-1-107x300.png,https://www.bevnet.com/news/spirits/2019/goodwood-brewing-co-launches-spirits-line/,"LOUISVILLE, Ky.— In a move toward diversifying its portfolio and reaching spirits consumers, Goodwood Brewing Co. announced a foray into the crafts spirits space with the launch of a Premium Bourbon aged in stout barrels.

The 90 proof, small-batch bourbon is the first product to be launched under the Goodwood Spirits line. As with all Goodwood Brewing products, an emphasis was placed on quality and craftsmanship, with months of preparation and experimentation going into the spirit.

Goodwood Stout Bourbon is aged in charred white oak American barrels for 12 years, before being finished in Goodwood Bourbon Stout barrels, for a special flavor that can only develop by being finished in this unique manner. The stout beer-barrel aging lends malt sweetness and a cocoa character to the robust whiskey tones of vanilla and sweet caramel.

“Bourbon has always been an integral part of the Goodwood product line with our barrel aged program,” noted CEO Ted Mitzlaff. “We are located in the heart of bourbon Country and understand the tremendous impact barrel finishing has on creating superior taste profiles. We are extremely excited to launch our first of many spirit expressions and believe the consumer will enjoy our Stout Bourbon as much as we do.”

Goodwood Spirits will be released in early February in select retail stores and exclusive accounts throughout the Louisville and Lexington markets, and will enter the rest of Kentucky in the near future.

"Internationally inspired nuts, better-for-you booze and a sesame surge are among the several emerging food and beverage trend predictions for 2019 that were highlighted in a webinar hosted by data technology company SPINS on Wednesday.",,https://d2azl42aua8mom.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/08171152/Spins_fullwidth_NOSH.jpg,https://www.nosh.com/news/2019/spins-2019-trend-predictions-webinar-recap/,"Internationally inspired nuts, better-for-you booze and a sesame surge are among the several emerging food and beverage trend predictions for 2019 that were highlighted in a webinar hosted by data technology company SPINS on Wednesday.

Led by Jessica Hochman, senior manager of natural insights and innovation research, and Brent Coons, director of natural insights, the presentation outlined food and beverage trends to watch in the year ahead along with quick picks of possible trends to watch for at Expo West.

Coons noted several alcohol trends to watch out for this year. He highlighted bitters as an emerging force in the natural products industry, as consumers’ palettes expand and the mixers category moves beyond high fructose corn syrup. Brands such as Hella Cocktails and Bitter Love have launched ready-to-drink options, which will make bitters more accessible to consumers as mocktails or mixers, according to Hochman.

“New-school alcohol” products like hard kombucha and hard seltzer have also found success as part of the better-for-you booze trend, Coons noted, predicting that craft brewers could soon get in on the action. Canned sparkling wine and cocktails is also a developing segment of note, with brands like Saturday Session and Cocktail Squad getting into the lower ABV trend.

Paleo-friendly products are now a half billion dollar segment, and 2019 will see the diet trend go more mainstream while still producing innovative grain-free non-dairy products, according to Coons. Kellogg’s acquisition of RXBar and Kraft Heinz’s acquisition of Primal Kitchen both indicate that larger companies are betting on this trend to last.

Internationally inspired nuts and seeds including the baruka and pili nuts are gaining popularity in snack brands like Pili Pushers, Coons stated, especially as they fit into on-trend paleo and keto diets. Coons predicted that these nuts could soon pop up in nut butters and plant-based beverages. Hochman also added that water lily seeds have gained momentum with brands like Rooted Food Co as a popcorn-like snack.

Despite its status as a known allergen, Hochman predicted 2019 will be the “Season of Sesame,” as the ingredient has appeared in milks, coffee blends and ice cream. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not consider it to be among the top eight allergens, Hochman claimed it might further evaluate that stance this year as 300,000 Americans are allergic to sesame.

Aronia berries are also a new ingredient trend, with Coons comparing the berry’s rise to consumers’ past embrace of gogi and acai berries. Though they have been previously seen in juice concentrates, aronia’s bitter flavor profile has limited its possibilities. Brands like Ax Water and Tohi have integrated the North American-grown berry into RTD beverages by mixing them with other juices and natural sweeteners, while Health-Ade Kombucha uses it in its Maca Berry product. It has even emerged in frozen fruit blends and jams alongside more familiar fruits as a way to introduce consumers to the ingredient.

The challenging kids’ beverages space will also evolve and possibly mature this year, Coons claimed, with brands like Rethink focusing on limiting sugar and and Hellowater integrating fiber into its products. Teas and natural drinks are also an emerging trend for kids, with brands such as Play Tea, Drazil, and Roar Organics’ Roar Kids, which has a licensing deal with Marvel, being examples.

Consumers’ increased interest in mitochondria health, driven by interest in the keto lifestyle, will bring new attention to supplements supporting everything from heart health to cognitive function. Coons predicted that cellular health ingredients like L-carnitine and alpha lipoic acid could soon appear in RTD beverages and functional foods.

Sleep support products are another trend expected to rise in popularity, according to Hochman, particularly in the form of small format beverages such as Snoooze’s Natural Sleep Drink and Pure Indian Foods’ Herbal Brahmi Ghee.

Consumers have also shown concern for ocean health, which drove the 2018 trend of passing on plastic, Hochman noted, and in the new year this concern for aquaculture will be channeled into fish-free seafood products from brands like Good Catch, as well as snacks like fish skins and seaweed.

Looking ahead, Coons and Hochman offered “quick picks” of what would be on their radar for Expo West. They predicted that wild-sourced ingredients will start to appear more in chocolate, tea and snacks, and regenerative agriculture will emerge as a priority for brands with a sharper focus on farmers and workers in the supply chain, with Hochman citing Loving Earth’s chocolate as an example. Coons predicted that the influence of keto at Expo West will be similar to that of paleo in 2014, and that keto-friendly dessert products will lead the charge this year. In the CBD space, Hochman stated that infused RTD beverages, chocolates and gummies will likely see a surge. Another functional ingredient gaining traction is bacopa, notable for its cognitive health benefits, which Coons stated will soon start to pop up in food and beverages.",SPINS 2019 Trend Predictions Webinar Recap
A ,2019-02-12,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/12182337/coke-fw.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/press-clips-emails-show-coke-courting-favor-with-cdc,"A report published last month in health policy journal The Milbank Quarterly which analyzed private emails between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Coca-Cola Company found that the soda giant has been working to influence policy dictated by the government agency.

According to Salon, the report analyzed 295 pages from 86 emails obtained via the Freedom of Information Act by U.S. Right To Know, a nonprofit organization which works to create transparency in the food and beverage industry.

The study found that Coke had sought to gain access to the agency and “shift attention and blame away from sugar-sweetened beverages” for obesity and other nutrition-related health epidemics. According to the report, Coke hoped to blame a “lack of physical activity” for the rise in obesity.

Emails reviewed in the analysis contained examples of Coke seeking to influence critics of sugar-sweetened beverages. One example showed an executive from the company discussing former World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Margaret Chan, who has blamed sugary drinks for contributing to global health crises. The exchanged revealed former Coke executive Alex Malaspina, who had previously worked with Barbara Bowman the CDC’s former director of its Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention, sought to gain access to Chan and “start a dialogue” between her and Coke-backed scientists.

According to CNN, the emails also showed “at least one visit was arranged for CDC staff to Coca-Cola’s headquarters.”

In a statement to Salon, U.S. Right to Know co-director Gary Ruskin called for Congress to investigate the relationship between the CDC and Coke to “ensure that CDC is not improperly influenced by corporations that manufacture harmful products.”

In response to the paper, Coke issued a statement affirming its commitment to fighting obesity and called for consumers to limit their daily sugar intake.

“We’ve listened closely to those in the public health community and other stakeholders to better understand the most appropriate role we can play to support the fight against obesity in a way that is credible, transparent, and beneficial for everyone and we have evolved our approach,” the statement said. “We recognize that too much sugar isn’t good for anyone. In fact, we support the current recommendation by several leading health authorities, including the World Health Organization, that people should limit their intake of added sugar to no more than 10% of their total energy/calorie consumption.”

In another controversy for Coke, the company apologized last week for a poorly received ad campaign with Delta Airlines.

Both companies felt the backlash from consumers online last month after Delta distributed napkins with advertisements for Diet Coke encouraging passengers to flirt with one another. The napkins read “Because you’re on a plane full of interesting people and hey… you never know” with lines for passengers to write down their name and number to give to their “plane crush.”

According to CNN, some passengers posted on Twitter that they found the napkins funny, while others felt the companies were encouraging unsolicited harassment.

“We sincerely apologize to anyone we may have offended,” Coke said in a statement quoted by CNN. “We worked with our partners at Delta to begin removing the napkins last month and are replacing them with other designs.”

While the rise of CBD (cannabidiol) has given coffee shops a new way to draw in consumers, Coffee By Design isn’t feeling it.

The Portland, ME-based coffee shop, which opened in 1994, is better known to locals by its acronym — CBD — to which it officially rebranded in 2017. The company has four locations in Maine and sells its beans wholesale globally, including to other area cafes which advertise serving “CBD Coffee.”

According to Bloomberg, the company says the rise of cannabidiol has created a wave of confusion among consumers as cafes advertise a different type of “CBD Coffee.” Because of source pricing for cannabidiol, the products often feature high surcharges upwards of $5, which the Coffee By Design says has resulted in consumers believing the company is raising its prices.

The company is now seeking to enforce its trademark. Co-owner Alan Spear told Bloomberg that Coffee By Design is okay with competitors advertising that they sell “CBD extract” but that the phrase “CBD coffee” is an infringement. The company is currently consulting with attorneys about potential legal action.

“We’re well within our rights to prevent others from using the term CBD as a trademark in relation to coffee and coffee shops,” Spear told Bloomberg. “As a responsible trademark owner, we have an obligation.”

In 1989, Marygrace Sexton took $20,000 she had saved from her job as a receptionist, purchased industrial tanks and a juicer, and named her startup after her newborn daughter. 30 years later, Natalie’s Orchid Island Juice Company is valued at an estimated $140 million and sells 25 SKUs in 42 countries.

Earlier this week, Forbes reporter Chloe Sorvino sat down with Marygrace and Natalie Sexton, the latter of whom is now the company’s VP of marketing, to learn more about the company’s past, present, and future, including their devotion to clean ingredients and how it competes with the beverage strategics.

“The beverage category is becoming so saturated and competitive,” Natalie told Forbes. “Many of these brands produce juices that they claim are clean or healthy, but if you read the ingredients, they’re not. We’re going to continue being the authentic option up against the other brands on the shelf.”",Press Clips: Emails Show Coke Courting Favor with CDC

The first in a series of capital investment projects to support its growing acidulants business, Bartek is expanding capacity and capabilities to allow for greater flexibility and support of its food, beverage and confectionery; animal nutrition; and industrial customers.

“Since TorQuest Partners’ acquisition of Bartek in October of 2018, we’ve executed several significant capital projects to expand our capacity and improve efficiency,” Bartek CEO John Burrows said. “Chief among these is an initiative to further increase malic and fumaric acid capacity by an additional 5,000 tons/year in 2019.”

Additional projects scheduled for completion in 2019 include state-of-the-art upgrades to Bartek’s laboratories and office facilities. These projects position Bartek to answer the growing global demand for malic acid, fumaric acid and maleic anhydride and to support its customers’ growth and innovation needs.

“Bartek’s presence will grow substantially in 2019 with the introduction of new products and packages to meet market demands, and we will continue to add value for our customers through a series of planned initiatives,” Bartek’s vice president of sales Dave Tapajna said. “With the addition of resources in sales and marketing, we will also increase Bartek’s presence at industry events and trade shows.”

Bartek’s specialty products portfolio delivers wide-ranging benefits to the markets it serves, improving taste, efficiency and efficacy for brands around the globe. Distributing to over 35 countries, Bartek ingredients impart desirable sourness in food, beverage and candy applications; displace antibiotics in animal feed; and provide versatile solutions for a wide range of industrial applications.

The 2019 schedule of capital improvement projects represents Bartek’s continued commitment to its customers worldwide and TorQuest’s ongoing commitment to cultivate that growth.

VIVIC’s line of sparkling coffees includes three flavors—original, sarsaparilla and lavender—each containing only 8 g of organic cane sugar. The sparkling coffees are packaged in individual BPA-free aluminum cans, which retail for $2.99.

“VIVIC evolved from passion, purpose, and a deep love for extraordinary coffee,” said Graham Gould, co-founder of VIVIC. “We noticed an opportunity in the marketplace for a sparkling coffee that was both low in sugar and provided unique flavor profiles not yet seen in the sparkling coffee category.”

Starting with direct trade coffee beans from Guillermo Moran, a fifth-generation farmer in El Salvador, all three VIVIC sparkling coffee flavors—Original, Sarsaparilla and Lavender—are brewed with pure spring water, a hint of licorice root and just 8 g of organic cane sugar. The Sarsaparilla and Lavender are infused with quality roots and botanicals to create innovative flavor combinations with carbonation.

“Licorice root is an ancient ingredient used by the Greeks, Eqyptians, Chinese and Hindus for its medicinal qualities,” said Louis Abruzzese, co-founder of VIVIC. “We love it because it enhances the perceived sweetness of our coffees, allowing the eight grams of sugar per can to taste like it contains more. Best part is, the flavor of licorice root is actually quite subtle, despite popular belief. It pairs perfectly with coffee, adding to the sweetness without any noticeable licorice flavor.”

VIVIC launched its sparkling coffee line with natural food retailers in Northern California. A complete list of retailers with VIVIC on their shelves today can be found on their website (drinkvivic.com/where-to-find-us/). In addition to being available in Northern California retailers, VIVIC is also available for purchase directly through the company’s website.

Additional sparkling coffee recipes will be introduced in the second quarter of 2019, and the brand has plans to expand beyond Northern California into other surrounding markets by the end of the year.

“Our goal is to create products that have a positive impact on both the consumer and all the stakeholders,” said Gould. “We’ll do this by keeping our minds open and continuing our research and innovation.”

Speaking with BevNET, GLOE Brands COO Steve Finn said the sparkling line will begin appearing on shelf throughout March and April, in line with spring resets. While the core Aloe GLOE line was available in about 20,000 stores last year, Finn said the sparkling line — which features turmeric and ginger based flavors — marks a new growth opportunity for the brand.

“The big difference is that now GLOE is a platform, so it’s broader in the number of SKUs per outlet,” Finn said. “We’ve grown from being an aloe based company to a plant-based functional beverage company with both still and sparkling products, so we see it that we now have a platform to grow from.”

Finn said that consumer awareness of aloe is still limited, but the addition of turmeric and ginger has “broadened the scope” for GLOE, as consumers are more willing to try the more familiar flavors. He added that the company is currently developing new flavors and refining the product formula.

GLOE reported 47 percent case growth in 2018, and Finn told BevNET the company’s velocity has increased by 65 percent — largely driven by sampling and other trial-driving promotions with retailers. Finn noted the company is also increasing digital and social promotions, adding that online sales via Amazon are becoming more important for both sales and promotion. He predicted the brand could see “10 or 20 times the growth” for Amazon sales in the near future.

“We feel like we’re at that moment of explosion for the brand, versus just moving along a little bit slower in years past,” Finn said.

In addition to retail, GLOE is also focused on growing its presence in the food service and on-premise channels. Finn said the company’s partnerships with multiple Coca-Cola DSD distributors has helped the brand to grow in that channel nationwide.

“For brands our size, one of the barriers you have is how do you get to those food service outlets where you can really build your brand through trial,” he said. “There’s no better way to do it than through a food service distributor like Coca-Cola…. In those areas [where the brand has Coke distribution], we can focus on the key markets and focus on multiple channels, and I really can’t stress how important that is to where we see the vision for our brand going.”

Fitness drink brand Celsius announced last week distribution agreements with several DSD distributors in the Anheuser-Busch InBev network, including Pepin Distributing, Hensley Beverage Company, and Tri-City Beverage.

“Growing demand for our proven fitness drinks and well-coordinated efforts by our sales team is laying the groundwork for a best in class DSD network for Celsius,” said president and CEO John Fieldly in a press release. “We have made tremendous progress in building out our DSD network which now includes members from three of the largest strategic distribution partners that cover several of the largest markets in the country.”

Celsius also recently added several Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) affiliated independent distributors, including Carolina Beverage, Piedmont Beverage, Quality Beverage, and Choice Beverage USA. As well, the company added MillerCoors distributors LDF Sales & Distribution and DET.

Origin Almond, maker of a line of cold-pressed almond juices, announced last week it has partnered with Rainforest Distribution and KeHE to expand the brand’s footprint in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions.

According to a press release, the Philadelphia-based brand is currently available in Whole Foods Market, MOM’s Organic Market, and Central Market stores.

Plant-based protein beverage brand Koia announced last week it has expanded distribution with Target, adding 530 stores in the Midwest and Northeast regions, as well as Florida. The retail chain will carry five SKUs — Vanilla Bean, Cacao Bean, Coconut Almond, Cold Brew Coffee, and Cinnamon Horchata — and will be sold in the refrigerated section.

“We are working to ensure that consumers across the country are able to purchase Koia wherever they shop, and Target will be a pivotal partner in achieving these goals,” said co-founder and CEO Chris Hunter in a press release. “As the plant-based category continues to gain familiarity and popularity, we are excited to expand our retail availability nationwide into now 5,000 stores with Target.”",Distribution Roundup: GLOE Ramps Up Retail Activations

For the first time, New York-area customers can enjoy the Lunar New Year with the same Coca-Cola cans as those sold in China and Hong Kong.

The special can, which displays a lantern with the Chinese character “Fortune,” will be available as supplies last. The Chinese New Year is celebrated Feb. 5 this year and festivities surrounding the holiday can last throughout February.

“We value our local communities and we want to embrace our diversity by introducing this special can to the New York market,” said Paul Mulligan, co-owner, Liberty Coca-Cola Beverages. “With our growing customer base in the various Asian communities throughout all five boroughs, we wanted to celebrate one of the staple events of the year.”

The idea for the can stemmed from Mulligan’s tenure with the Coca-Cola Company when he worked in several Asian countries and where the can has been distributed regularly as part of the New Year celebration. This is the first year the local bottler is distributing the Chinese New Year can, as it is part of Liberty’s larger mission to recognize its nuanced customer base and grow its community presence in its local markets.

“We live and work here in our communities and we are always looking for ways to give back and make a real difference,” said Mulligan.

Il Young Park, a 21-year Coca-Cola veteran and account executive, has been charged with leading Liberty Coca-Cola Beverages’ efforts to distribute the limited edition can throughout the New York metro market.

“I am thrilled to be offering my customers this new product,” said Park. “I have been with the company for more than 20 years, and this is the first time we are doing something of this scale to recognize Asians in New York.”

Beyond the Chinese New Year Cans, Park and his team of sales associates – who are fluent in Mandarin, Korean and Cantonese – have made it a priority to break through the segmentation barriers by becoming part of the local communities it serves.

They have attended local chamber and association events, volunteered at the Korean Day Parade and Street Festival and began a concerted push to better communicate with small business owners. In a single month this year, Park and his team on boarded more than 100 new Asian American customers in Brooklyn and Queens. Their innovative strategy included techniques that identified unconventional outlets where they were able to present Liberty’s vast beverage portfolio and localized presence.

“We want to expand our footprint into all local communities,” said Park. “We are a localized company servicing those areas and we want our associates to be as localized and involved as possible.”

“Il Young’s efforts are to be commended as he has been a passionate ambassador of Coca-Cola,” said Mulligan. “It is important for our associates to ensure that we are bringing intrinsic value to all of our communities.”

“Look out, Colorado! Impeach Vodka is coming to a liquor store near you. But not the s—hole ones,” proclaimed the humorous brand’s viral first Facebook post, ribbing on real quotes from the commander-in-chief. “Grab a bottle and enjoy the bigly peach flavor. It’s the peachiest. Nothing is peachier than this vodka. Everybody has said how great it is at being peach.”

The ABV (alcohol by volume) for Impeach Vodka is 45 percent— an unusually high proof for vodka, which is typically filtered to 40 percent ABV. The number 45 is another comical dig at the bottle’s muse. Creative cocktail recipes featured on Impeach Vodka’s website include The Moron Lago, Moscow Ass, Peach Russian and the Stormy Daniels.

Approximately 40 percent of the flavored water company’s $100 million in annual revenue comes from online sales, a majority of which is from its website, drinkhint.com. When advising entrepreneurs on how to build a foundation for success online, Goldin encourages them to keep it simple.

“Whether you’re a $500,000 brand or you’re a $1 billion brand, start small,” she said in an interview included in this episode. “Launch a small website… and make it really simple to transact. If you start with ‘the consumer controls your destiny,’ make it easy. Think about your own life. People are really busy. Spend money on photography, (include) a really basic story and make it super-easy to check out. And then spend a little bit of money on ads.”

As part of the interview, recorded at Hint’s headquarters in San Francisco, Goldin also discussed the mission and purpose of its brick-and-mortar retail store, which it describes as an “experiential water bar,” and how it has enabled the company to learn more about its consumers.

"– Altru Brands, LLC today announced the launch of Altru, an innovative functional water beverage that is a fusion of exotic flavors and a proprietary blend of electrolytes, natural caffeine and antioxidants, including glutathione.",2019-02-5,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/05124808/0-2-418x320.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/altru-brands-launch-altru-flavored-water-beverages,"DAYTON, N.J.– Altru Brands, LLC today announced the launch of Altru, an innovative functional water beverage that is a fusion of exotic flavors and a proprietary blend of electrolytes, natural caffeine and antioxidants, including glutathione.

Altru is available in four original flavor combinations: Peach Mangosteen, Tangerine Prickly Pear, Mango Cherimoya and Coconut Jackfruit. Each Altru beverage features an exotic fruit flavor paired with a familiar fruit flavor, creating truly unique flavor profiles. Each 16 oz. bottle of Altru contains 10 calories, less than one gram of sugar, a proprietary natural sweetener blend and no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. Altru debuted at number four on Amazon’s “Hot New Releases” in flavored drinking water in its first week of sales.

Each flavor also features a patent-pending blend of antioxidants and electrolytes, and it is the first and only beverage containing glutathione. Glutathione is commonly known as the “Master Antioxidant” or the “Mother of All Antioxidants” because scientific studies have shown that it is the most vital and critical antioxidant to good health. Research has demonstrated that increasing levels of glutathione can raise energy levels, strengthen the immune system and detoxify the body.

Altru is short for “altruism,” which means selfless concern for the well-being of others. Altru was founded by three scientists who are also pet rescue owners. Their passion for securing homes for cats and dogs in need is highlighted by their commitment to donating 10 percent of the company’s profits to pet rescues.

The growth of retail sales of enhanced waters in the United States is far outpacing the growth of other beverage categories such as plain bottled water, sodas, juice and dairy beverages. Millennials are a key demographic driving this high velocity category, and they have expressed a keen interest in new flavor profiles and functional innovation.

“Consumers are tired of functional beverages with the same functional ingredients and the same flavors they have been drinking for years. Altru is a trailblazing new water beverage that not only contains unique and exotic fruit flavors, but also features a new functional ingredient not contained in any other beverage on the market: glutathione, the superhero of antioxidants. We are excited to bring to market a pioneering better-for-you water beverage with globally inspired fruit flavors,” said Altru co-founder Eugene Gross. “As pet-loving scientists, my co-founders and I donate a portion of Altru’s profits to pet rescues, so rescue pets like my cat Hayley can find loving homes. This cause is built into our company’s DNA.”

Altru Brands, LLC is a New Jersey-based beverage company founded by three friends and scientists, Sam Hamid, Eugene Gross and Ken Valenzano. They decided to formulate their own beverages after seeing a void in the functional beverage market. They believe in providing consumers with low-calorie better-for-you beverages with simple ingredients and tantalizing flavors. The founders are also rescue pet owners who are dedicated to helping homeless pets by donating 10 percent of Altru’s net profits to pet rescues.

The investment was made through Constellation’s venture capital group that identifies and invests in premium, emerging brands in categories that provide strong scalability, consumer appeal and a unique niche or point of differentiation in the market. Black Button will continue to manage, produce, market and sell its high-performing, award-winning spirits such as its Straight Bourbon Whiskey, Citrus Forward Gin, seasonal Lilac Gin and Bespoke Bourbon Cream.

Black Button, the first grain-to-glass craft distillery in Rochester since Prohibition, was founded in 2012 by Jason Barrett, a fourth-generation entrepreneur. Less than two years later, Black Button Distilling opened a tasting room and retail store to the public, offering spirits tastings, distillery tours and craft cocktails. Every batch of Black Button’s world-class spirits is distilled from New York State grains, and then aged, bottled and labeled in Rochester.

“For us to continue the growth rate we believe we are capable of, it was time to find an equity partner. But we didn’t want just any equity partner. We wanted someone who understood our business, our culture and our goals,” said Barrett. “We found that partner right in our back yard. Constellation shares our love of Western NY and they are also committed to the agricultural roots that are so important to Black Button. This partnership is great for our employees, our ownership, our farmers and our consumers because we will be able to bring more great Black Button products to our community.”

Sales have more than tripled since 2014, and in 2017 Black Button expanded and opened a tasting room and bottle shop in Buffalo, N.Y. Black Button Distilling has won multiple awards including USA TODAY’s “10 Best Craft Distilleries,” the TheFiftyBest.com’s 2018 Silver Medal for its Straight Bourbon Whiskey in the Best Bourbon Category, and NASDAQ Stock Market’s 2016 list of “Next Great Consumer Brands.”

“As a company headquartered in the Greater Rochester region, we’re especially proud to make this investment in this local favorite,” said Constellation’s President and Chief Operating Officer, and incoming Chief Executive Officer Bill Newlands. “Black Button has a proven track record of producing premium craft spirits that resonate with consumers and they have a variety of products that are aligned to consumer trends and fill white space within Constellation’s spirits portfolio. With our shared knowledge, experience and guidance, we will work together to help Black Button grow and expand the brands that craft spirits enthusiasts have come to know and love.”

Black Button Distilling’s spirits are currently distributed throughout New York State, in select markets in the Northeast and MidAtlantic, most notably New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Washington, D.C. and can also be found in regional on and off premise accounts.

Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

Since 1922, Jason Barrett’s family has provided some of the finest men’s suit buttons available. For four generations these buttons have closed suits worn by Presidents, Popes, Kings and businessmen the world over. From a young age, Jason went to work in his grandfather’s factory, but it was clear he was meant for a different path. He broke tradition and decided to make whiskey. Black Button Distilling is the first grain-to-glass craft distillery in Rochester, New York since prohibition. Founded in 2012 near Rochester’s historic Public Market, Black Button Distilling specializes in farm to still products, using unique and all-natural ingredients from local farms to craft 115,000 bottles of award-winning spirits each year, distributed in 11 states and Japan. As a New York State Farm Distillery, Black Button Distilling is deeply committed to crafting high quality spirits with New York State grown and produced ingredients. Over 90 percent of ingredients in Black Button Distilling spirits are grown or produced in New York State. All corn, wheat, rye and barley are sourced locally from Edgewood Farms in Groveland, a nearly 1,600-acre farm south of Rochester. Dairy cream for Bespoke Bourbon Cream liqueur is sourced from New York State farms and apple cider for Apple Pie Moonshine comes from LynOaken Farms in Medina.

Taking design inspiration from one of The Macallan’s iconic Six Pillars, each beautiful gift box shines a light on the Curiously Small Stills through a beautiful illustration in honor of this festive celebration. Recognized as a major focus on the Lunar calendar and one of the most significant and meaningful holidays globally, the Chinese-inspired artistic reimagining of the stills provides a beautiful canvas from which to acknowledge this occasion.

Founded in 1824 in the heart of Speyside, The Macallan was one of the first distilleries in Scotland to be legally licensed. Since then it has built a reputation as one of the world’s finest single malt whiskies. The story of The Macallan is built on the Six Pillars, each influencing the whisky in its own distinct way. From the spiritual home of Easter Elchies House; curiously small stills giving richness to the pure spirit; finest cut or the best of the best of the distillation, to exceptional oak casks which account for up to 80 percent of the final flavor in the whisky; natural color and finally peerless spirit, The Macallan itself. Wood sits at the heart of The Macallan. The vital contributing influences of Spain, North America and Scotland, together with true mastery, set it apart from the rest.

Iron Smoke CASKet Strength Straight Bourbon Whiskey is a very limited quantity of their unfiltered, uncut, small batch bourbon. This rare and exceptionally complex 120 proof offering is handpicked from thousands of their very own triple char virgin white oak barrels. CASKet Strength has absolutely no liquid filler from any other source and delicious notes of butterscotch, vanilla and caramel.

Iron Smoke CASKet Strength is certain to be a game changer among fans of our flagship Straight Bourbon Whiskey and brown spirit enthusiasts across the country!” said President Tom Riggio. “This is based on the growing popularity of truly handcrafted cask strength and unfiltered offerings from pure hearted distilleries that have taken the long hard road of making their own products without any filler from outside sources. This release, as well as the recent accolades we’ve received from Forbes naming Iron Smoke one of the top 10 bourbons produced outside of Kentucky proves that we are building the brand the right way! We look forward to working with our distributors to make Iron Smoke a household name across the country.”

Based in Fairport, New York Iron Smoke Distillery produces distinct world-class bourbons and whiskeys that can be enjoyed neat or in classic cocktails.

"Over the past two months, investment group and incubator Sonoma Brands has seen changes to its operating team including the addition of two managing directors. Founder Jon Sebastiani told NOSH the additions are reflective of how the firm has evolved since its inception, adding both to its portfolio of investments and owned properties: marshmallow brand Smashmallow, egg brand Peckish and drinkable chilled soup brand Zupa Noma.",,https://d2azl42aua8mom.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/12183450/Sonoma_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.nosh.com/news/2019/sonoma-brands-sees-management-additions,"Over the past two months, investment group and incubator Sonoma Brands has seen changes to its operating team including the addition of two managing directors. Founder Jon Sebastiani told NOSH the additions are reflective of how the firm has evolved since its inception, adding both to its portfolio of investments and owned properties: marshmallow brand Smashmallow, egg brand Peckish and drinkable chilled soup brand Zupa Noma.

Recently, Kevin Murphy joined the firm as a managing director. Murphy spent 13 years at Encore Capital, as one of the earliest employees of the firm. Murphy, a friend of Sebastiani’s since his Krave days, told NOSH that after departing Encore last summer, he was drawn to the operator-focused investment thesis that Sonoma offered brands.

“I saw true investment capability with a building track record, but coming from different perspectives than what we normally see with a traditionally structured investment firm,” Murphy said.

Joining Murphy as managing director is Brian Nicholson, who joined Sonoma as a principle in January 2018. Nicholson brought with him a focus on ecommerce, digital media and direct-to-consumer businesses, having spent five years with Stripes Group, leading the firm’s investments in Refinery29, Reformation and The Black Tux.

Those digital skills will benefit not only Sonoma’s investments, which include direct-to-consumer kids meal plan Yumble, but also Sonoma’s own brands. Zupa Noma, for example, went from being sold in brick and mortar stores to an ecommerce focus. Sebastiani cited a struggle to connect and educate consumers on retail shelves as the cause for the change.

Peckish has also focused on digital, as it has taken a more measured approach to its launch. The brand first entered California’s Erewhon in January before rolling out in Equinox locations in the Northeast, Whole Foods’ 365 stores and direct-to-consumer via its website.

“With Peckish we’re building a different value proposition, so [we’re going] much slower,” Sebastiani said. “Peckish was a brand that we’re going to slowly bleed out into the marketplace into very influential accounts.”

Peckish’s rollout comes as the brand has also undergone staffing changes. In December, Peckish CEO and Sonoma Brands Chief Brand officer Chelsea Bialla departed the company. Sebastiani told NOSH that Bialla had departed for “personal reasons” but her “fingerprints are all over our brands.” To fill the vacancy, Lauren Egan has been promoted to VP of Brand and the Sonoma Brands team is assisting with operations and the day-to-day management of the business. It’s a testament, Sebastiani said, to the Sonoma team.

“Having a tremendously complimentary, collaborative group of people that are accretive in their backgrounds and talents to each other is just sensationally important,” Sebastiani said.",Sonoma Brands Sees Management Additions

"While poor weather conditions led to a slower fourth quarter for convenience stores last year, total beverage sales grew 2.9 percent and retailers are optimistic for strong growth throughout 2019, according to the latest “Beverage Buzz” survey of c-store retailers by Wells Fargo Securities.",2019-02-7,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/18153506/WellsFargo_Cstore_Fullwidth.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/c-store-survey-retailers-optimistic-despite-slow-q4,"While poor weather conditions led to a slower fourth quarter for convenience stores last year, total beverage sales grew 2.9 percent and retailers are optimistic for strong growth throughout 2019, according to the latest “Beverage Buzz” survey of c-store retailers by Wells Fargo Securities.

Wells Fargo analysts reached out to multiple retailers who represent roughly 23,000 convenience stores nationwide requesting their thoughts and comments on beverage sales trends in Q4 of 2018.

According to the report, retailers anticipate total beverage sales to increase 3.7 percent this year, with ready-to-drink coffee, energy drinks, and import beer among the fastest growing categories. Both RTD coffee and energy are expected to grow 7.8 percent, while import beer is projected to rise 8.2 percent.

The Coca-Cola Company saw mixed results in the quarter, with sales up a “somewhat muted” 2.5 percent, a significant deceleration from 4.6 percent growth in Q3. Wells Fargo blamed the decline on recent pricing decisions, which led to a decrease in volume. However, the company’s evolving product portfolio, particularly its purchase of a majority stake in sports drink brand BODYARMOR, has retailers excited for future growth.

PepsiCo was down by 0.7 percent, compared to a “very solid” 2.8 percent growth in Q3. In particular, Gatorade is “in large trouble” as BODYARMOR continues its momentum, according to some retailers polled.

“Pepsi continues to hang their hat on CSDs, a weak Pure Leaf line up, a water no longer holding its own and a unusual marriage to Rockstar that is anemic at best,” one retailer wrote. “They should reduce their ask in CSD space, increase tea space to allow for more Brisk flavors, get out of the energy business and use this space to increase Propel and Starbucks.”

Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) reported 3.3 percent dollar sales growth, down from 4.8 percent growth in Q3. However, retailers said they were “disappointed” in the company’s execution and its “hit-or-miss communication,” with some retailers reporting they have lost contact with the company’s sales representatives. The loss of allied brands Fiji and BodyArmor also impacted the company’s sales, but FORTO and CORE Water have so far proved to be valuable brands.

“KDP has made a major step backwards,” one retailer said. “They have always had inefficiencies and it has gotten worse.”

In energy, sales of Monster were up 7.3 percent in c-stores, but retailers forecast only 6.1 percent growth for the brand this year, with a price increase pushing consumers toward other brands, according to the report. Sixty percent of retailers said they have seen an acceleration in Red Bull volume and sales since the change. Monster is also facing increased competition from fitness energy brand Bang, which 90 percent of retailers said they either currently carry or plan to carry. Retailers were split on Bang’s potential to eat away from Monster’s market share, with some saying they believed it was complementary, while others expressed concern Monster sales could decline and that its own fitness energy line, Reign, is “too little too late.” Notably, 25 percent of retailers said Monster has increased promos to offset its price increase. Forty-five percent of retailers said they have seen a de-acceleration in Monster’s volume growth.

Retailers are optimistic about the innovation pipeline for both Monster and Red Bull, and said the rise of brands like Bang and Celsius are large drivers for the category’s strong 2019 growth projection.

In coffee, 31 percent of retailers said they had heard about plans that Coke might bring Costa Coffee to the U.S., following its $5.1 billion purchase of the European company last year. Thought he company has made no announcements of plans to begin importing the brand — which does not currently have an RTD product — only 29 percent said they would stock the brand if it did. Survey respondents also noted that cold brew coffee is gaining popularity, and that Coke’s partnerships with Dunkin’ and McCafe have driven growth in the category.

Retailers remain largely optimistic about the prospects for cannabidiol (CBD) beverages, which saw a rush of innovation last year from established and startup brands, but a lack of legal clarity for the ingredient has now led to some skepticism. The survey showed 94 percent of retailers said they expected CBD to be a “big opportunity” and 86 percent said they plan to carry CBD products, a decrease from 100 percent of retailers saying “yes” to both questions in Wells Fargo’s Q3 2018 survey. Retailers told Wells Fargo that even with the passage of the U.S. Farm Bill, “many states are not on board and are preventing wholesalers from carrying the product.”

Others were concerned with the actual products, criticizing flavor profiles as “not very good” and calling the packaging for many CBD brands “over the top.” At least one retailer, however, said they “suspect similar trends to vaping” for CBD’s growth potential in food and beverage.",C-Store Survey: Retailers Optimistic Despite Slow Q4

The formerly limited-edition summer seasonal flavor is packed with light, fresh flavors to bring a splash of summertime spontaneity to any season.

“Our Strawberry Basil was such a hit this summer as a limited release that we decided to add it to our full-time line up,” said Matt Thomas, founder and CEO of Brew Dr. Kombucha. “It’s tart, tasty and made exclusively from organic tea blends and botanicals. It will also be available in a 12-oz can which is great for hikes, bike rides and trips to the beach. We think it’s perfect for long-time kombucha fans and newbies alike.”

Brew Dr. Strawberry Basil kombucha combines high-quality green tea with strawberries and two types of basil. The result is a fresh and fizzy kombucha with a perfectly balanced flavor. Strawberry Basil will be available in 14 oz. and 32 oz. bottles and 4-packs of 12 oz. cans.

Since launching Brew Dr. Kombucha in 2008 from the kitchens of Townshend’s Teahouses, the brand has continued to innovate its kombucha-making process. Using a unique vacuum still, Brew Dr. Kombucha removes the alcohol from the fermented tea without the use of heat, preserving the beverage’s beneficial live and active cultures. All varieties use Townshend’s custom organic tea blends, herbs and botanicals, resulting in a smooth and balanced taste.

For the complete list of varieties available and more information about Brew Dr. Kombucha, visit brewdrkombucha.com.

Townshend’s Tea Company was started by Matt Thomas in 2006 with the idea of serving great teas in a casual teahouse setting. Over the years, the effort of presenting the wide world of tea to their guests has expanded the Townshend’s collection to over 120 tea offerings, including classic teas, rare varieties, chai latte recipes made from scratch, Taiwanese bubble tea and an herbal apothecary line. The company now operates nine teahouses in Oregon, Montana and Utah. In 2008, the company began making kombucha in the kitchens of their then two teahouses, giving it the name Brew Dr. Kombucha. It was only natural for them to choose some of the same great custom tea blends they had developed for service at their popular teahouses and ferment those into kombucha. It turns out that approach is unique, as most commercially available kombucha is flavored with juice at the time of bottling. Brew Dr. Kombucha’s flavor profiles come from attention to the quality and formulation of the organic tea and botanicals used, creating a difference you can taste.",Strawberry Basil Joins Brew Dr. Kombucha's Full-Time Line-Up

The Denver-based tea company is poised to create even more customer demand as it launches Tea Soda, its first ready-to-drink line.

Tea Sodas feature real brewed tea, fruit, herbs and just the right amount of sparkle. The 100 percent organic and ethically-sourced effervescent drinks were originally introduced at Teatulia’s Denver-based Tea Bar and have been best sellers from the start.

“The overwhelmingly positive reactions we got at Tea Bar told us we were onto something big with Tea Soda,” said Linda Appel Lipsius, CEO and co-founder of Teatulia. “Lightly sweetened with cane sugar, Tea Sodas deliver pure refreshment and are a great alternative to natural soda, sparkling water and even energy drinks. We chose cans because they are infinitely recyclable and in line with the commitment to minimal waste packaging we’ve always had with our hot teas. Tea Sodas are spot-on trend with what today’s consumer is looking for.”

Teatulia’s Organic Tea Sodas are served in attention grabbing 12 oz. sleek cans with designs that reflect the bright splashes of color found at the Holi Festival. They come in four distinctive flavor combinations with layers customers can taste:

The lineup will initially be offered in food service venues across the United States. Teatulia will launch its retail business in its home Rocky Mountain region.

Teatulia is named for the region in Northern Bangladesh where its tea is grown. Named one of “The 2017 Most Innovative Women in Food and Drink” by Fortune Food & Wine, Teatulia’s CEO and co-founder Linda Appel Lipsius made the list for her transformative impact on what we eat and drink. Appel Lipsius has helped Teatulia reach a lot of firsts, including being the first company to import tea to the U.S. from Bangladesh. Teatulia cultivates its teas using only natural farming methods. Its garden-direct sourcing means the teas do not sit in long-term warehouse storage or wait around to be blended by a third party. This results in great-tasting teas that are better for the land, its people and the environment. Teatulia is mindful of how its actions impact worldwide communities and actively supports ethical organizations like the Whole Planet Foundation, Rainforest Alliance and B Corporation. Teatulia is proud of its exquisite, clean and smooth-tasting teas that support education, business and health initiatives as well as demonstrate a thorough commitment to sustainability.

Confusion over the legal status of cannabidiol (CBD) as an ingredient in food and beverage products was highlighted again this week after state health departments in Maine and New York took actions to crack down on the popular ingredient.,2019-02-7,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/07114322/NY-ME-CBD_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/cbd-update-nyc-maine-health-depts-crack-down,"Confusion over the legal status of cannabidiol (CBD) as an ingredient in food and beverage products was highlighted again this week after state health departments in Maine and New York took actions to crack down on the popular ingredient.

The New York Post reported on Tuesday that officials from the Department of Health have begun confiscating CBD-infused foods from restaurants and food service outlets during routine inspections. According to the Post, as of Tuesday, five restaurants have been ordered to cease all sales of products that contain CBD.

This follows the department’s announcement last month of an embargo on such products; the Post reported that officials will begin issuing fines of up to $650 starting July 1.

“Restaurants in New York City are not permitted to add anything to food or drink that is not approved as safe to eat,” a department spokeswoman told the Post. “The Health Department takes seriously its responsibility to protect New Yorkers’ health. Until cannabidiol (CBD) is deemed safe as a food additive, the Department is ordering restaurants not to offer products containing CBD.”

Meanwhile, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services began sending letters in late January to businesses informing them that CBD is an unapproved food additive that is not recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), according to a story in The Portland Press Herald. Retailers will still be permitted to sell non-oral CBD items, such as balms and vaping products.

According to a memo by Maine Assistant Attorney General Deanna White provided to The Press Herald, the shift in policy came after lawyers for the state determined that CBD cannot be used in foods until the FDA confirms it as an approved ingredient.

A group of over 100 people attended a rally at the Maine State House on Tuesday to protest the government’s decision. Inside the chamber, Rep. Craig Hickman (D) introduced an emergency bill that would make the sale of hemp-derived CBD legal. The bill, which Hickman said has the support of Gov. Janet Mills, may receive a public hearing by the end of February.

Following the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill which legalized industrial hemp production on a federal level, individual states have moved to take greater control over how they manage the growing market for hemp-derived products of all types. But the FDA’s position remains unchanged that CBD is not an approved ingredient for use in food and beverage products, and some states have been wary of violating federal guidelines. Last July, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) issued a revised FAQ in which it reaffirmed its position that CBD cannot be used as an approved ingredient in food and beverage products until the FDA changes its status.

Lauren Rudick, an attorney at New York-based firm Hiller PC who specializes in cannabis, told BevNET that she hopes the recent actions would increase pressure on the FDA to change its current position relative to CBD. She noted that while retailers in New York City haven’t yet reported that any packaged CBD products have been confiscated by the Health Department, it didn’t mean they should consider those products immune.

“It hasn’t happened yet, but it wouldn’t surprise me if it did,” she said.

Steven Phan, co-founder of New York-based specialty CBD retailer Come Back Daily, told BevNET on Wednesday that city health officials haven’t yet confiscated any of the CPG products sold in his store. Located in Manhattan, Come Back Daily sells several packaged food and beverage brands containing CBD as well as tinctures, balms, and vape cartridges.

Phan said the decision by the Department of Health has, however, put the company’s plans to add an in-store cafe on hold. But should there be a similar confiscation of CPG products, he said his company has developed strong community support and he “wouldn’t take it laying down.”

“I knew when we started it was going to be a gray area, although it was much less of a strenuous experience than I anticipated,” Phan said, noting that he has worked closely with the local government to ensure his store meets all legal requirements. “Regulations will continue to unfold and I welcome that.”

Justin Prochnow, attorney at Greenberg Traurig LLP, told BevNET that he tells his clients that individual states’ health departments pose a greater risk to CBD food and beverage brands than the FDA.

“State departments of health can go into local restaurants or grocery stores and essentially red-tag products that they believe are non-compliant and tell them to remove them from the shelf,” he said. “States are looking at this and thinking there’s going to be such a huge influx of products that they are going to have to either early-on make clear that [they] don’t think it’s permissible, or, if they sit back, they will be too late and there will be too many things out there.”

While health officials in Maine and New York have taken action, there has also been recent movement on the issue in Washington, D.C. On Jan. 15, Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Jeff Merkely (D-OR) sent a letter to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb in support of updating the rules governing use of certain hemp-derived ingredients in food, beverages, and dietary supplements. The letter requests that the agency “immediately begin updating regulations for hemp-derived CBD and other hemp-derived cannabinoids, and [to] give U.S. producers more flexibility in the production, consumption, and sale of hemp products.”

Flower Power Coffee House in Queens, which has been serving CBD-infused products since it opened in April, posted a message on Instagram stating it would be “writing to our government officials to enlist their support in lifting this CBD embargo.”

Prochnow said that it is unlikely that the FDA is pressuring individual states to take action against CBD products. He noted that New York has independently taken similar actions against chlorophyll, activated charcoal and other ingredients in the past.

”We are seeing so many products being put out there, that the odds are you are going to see more of these types of things,” he said. “It certainly has companies concerned.”","CBD Update: NYC, Maine Health Depts. Crack Down"

The Hamilton, Ontario-based craft brewery, located about 50 miles from the New York border, has established a sister company called Collective Project Limited that will develop and sell cannabis-infused beverages.

In a conversation with Brewbound, CEO and co-founder Matt Johnston said the new line of THC- and CBD-infused beverages would be “artisanal” in nature, and could include non-alcoholic beer, as well as cold brew coffee or tea.

“Our company was founded on creativity and innovation,” he said. “We like to play and try new things.”

Johnston said the company, which already distributes its beers in 12 U.S. states, is aiming to launch hemp-based CBD beverages in the U.S. this summer.

However, Collective Project Ltd. must wait until at least October 17 before it can introduce cannabis-infused beverages into the Canadian market, as edible and drinkable products are not currently permitted for legal sale.

Nevertheless, Collective Project Ltd. is pushing forward with a plan to produce its infused beverages in the U.S., and it is in the process of establishing “potential partnerships on the supply and co-packing side of the cannabis world,” Johnston said.

The company is also planning to make a multi-million dollar investment on dealcoholization equipment, which will be used to produce non-alcoholic beer infused with THC and CBD, Johnston said.

Collective Arts, which produced fewer than 50,000 barrels of beer in 2018, according to Johnston, currently distributes beer to New York, Illinois, Tennessee, Vermont, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Florida, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Virginia, the U.K., and Sweden. It is planning to expand sales of its beer to New Jersey, Indiana, Ohio, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Spain, Norway and China in 2019.

Johnston said the Collective Project Ltd. sister company would look “more holistically” at “marrying the footprint” for its CBD-infused products while focusing on West Coast states such as California and Oregon where recreational cannabis is legal for distribution of its THC-infused products.

Collective Arts joins a growing list of beer manufacturers that have already invested in the cannabis space. Large beer companies such as Anheuser-Busch InBev (Tilray), Constellation Brands (Canopy Growth) and Molson Coors (Hexo) have each struck partnerships with Canadian cannabis companies. Other U.S. beer manufacturers, including Flying Dog, and Heineken-owned Lagunitas have experimented or explored the possibility of THC- and CBD-infused beverages. Craft Brew Alliance is also eying the sector.

Recreational use of cannabis was legalized in Canada last October. It is not federally legal in the U.S., however 10 states — Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C. — have established laws permitting the sale and use of recreational cannabis within their borders.

A press release with additional details about Collective Project Ltd. is included below.

Collective Arts to produce cannabis-infused beverages under sister company, Collective Project Ltd.

February 4, 2019 – Hamilton, Ont – Collective Arts announced today that it plans to launch a portfolio of cannabis and hemp infused beverages in Canada and the United States. Cannabis and hemp products will be produced, marketed and sold under a sister company, Collective Project Limited, in late 2019 pending anticipated government approvals for cannabis and hemp products.

“Collective Arts is committed to producing high-quality, innovative products that we and our community of creatives want to enjoy. We push the boundaries when it comes to making beer and cider, and now cannabis; creativity, quality, and our relationships with our artists are at the core of what we do. Moving into a territory such as infused cannabis beverages gives us an ideal palate to be innovative, and also creates a new format for social experiences outside of alcohol,” explains Matt Johnston, CEO, and co-founder of Collective Arts.

Collective Arts has applied for an R&D License, License for Standard Processing and a Licence for Sale pursuant to the Cannabis Regulations Ontario. Their intention is to produce these products at their current facility in Hamilton, Ontario and a partner facility in the United States. Collective Arts is in talks with licensed producers and infusion technology providers and will announce these partnerships later this year.

Collective Arts was founded in 2013 by Matt Johnston and Bob Russell on the belief that creativity fuels creativity. Collective Arts is committed to fusing the craft of brewing with the inspired talents of emerging artists. Their beers are designed to be as diverse, creative and unwavering as the artists profiled; respecting tradition but not constrained by it. Collective Arts features limited-edition works of art on its packaging by artists and musicians that change every few months. To date over 600 artists and musicians have been featured and championed by Collective Arts.",Canada’s Collective Arts Brewing to Enter Cannabis Market

Approximately 40 percent of the flavored water company’s $100 million in annual revenue comes from online sales, a majority of which is from its website, drinkhint.com. When advising entrepreneurs on how to build a foundation for success online, Goldin encourages them to keep it simple.

“Whether you’re a $500,000 brand or you’re a $1 billion brand, start small,” she said in an interview included in this episode. “Launch a small website… and make it really simple to transact. If you start with ‘the consumer controls your destiny,’ make it easy. Think about your own life. People are really busy. Spend money on photography, (include) a really basic story and make it super-easy to check out. And then spend a little bit of money on ads.”

As part of the interview, recorded at Hint’s headquarters in San Francisco, Goldin also discussed the mission and purpose of its brick-and-mortar retail store, which it describes as an “experiential water bar,” and how it has enabled the company to learn more about its consumers.

"Internationally inspired nuts, better-for-you booze and a sesame surge are among the several emerging food and beverage trend predictions for 2019 that were highlighted in a webinar hosted by data technology company SPINS on Wednesday.",,https://d2azl42aua8mom.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/08171152/Spins_fullwidth_NOSH.jpg,https://www.nosh.com/news/2019/spins-2019-trend-predictions-webinar-recap/,"Internationally inspired nuts, better-for-you booze and a sesame surge are among the several emerging food and beverage trend predictions for 2019 that were highlighted in a webinar hosted by data technology company SPINS on Wednesday.

Led by Jessica Hochman, senior manager of natural insights and innovation research, and Brent Coons, director of natural insights, the presentation outlined food and beverage trends to watch in the year ahead along with quick picks of possible trends to watch for at Expo West.

Coons noted several alcohol trends to watch out for this year. He highlighted bitters as an emerging force in the natural products industry, as consumers’ palettes expand and the mixers category moves beyond high fructose corn syrup. Brands such as Hella Cocktails and Bitter Love have launched ready-to-drink options, which will make bitters more accessible to consumers as mocktails or mixers, according to Hochman.

“New-school alcohol” products like hard kombucha and hard seltzer have also found success as part of the better-for-you booze trend, Coons noted, predicting that craft brewers could soon get in on the action. Canned sparkling wine and cocktails is also a developing segment of note, with brands like Saturday Session and Cocktail Squad getting into the lower ABV trend.

Paleo-friendly products are now a half billion dollar segment, and 2019 will see the diet trend go more mainstream while still producing innovative grain-free non-dairy products, according to Coons. Kellogg’s acquisition of RXBar and Kraft Heinz’s acquisition of Primal Kitchen both indicate that larger companies are betting on this trend to last.

Internationally inspired nuts and seeds including the baruka and pili nuts are gaining popularity in snack brands like Pili Pushers, Coons stated, especially as they fit into on-trend paleo and keto diets. Coons predicted that these nuts could soon pop up in nut butters and plant-based beverages. Hochman also added that water lily seeds have gained momentum with brands like Rooted Food Co as a popcorn-like snack.

Despite its status as a known allergen, Hochman predicted 2019 will be the “Season of Sesame,” as the ingredient has appeared in milks, coffee blends and ice cream. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not consider it to be among the top eight allergens, Hochman claimed it might further evaluate that stance this year as 300,000 Americans are allergic to sesame.

Aronia berries are also a new ingredient trend, with Coons comparing the berry’s rise to consumers’ past embrace of gogi and acai berries. Though they have been previously seen in juice concentrates, aronia’s bitter flavor profile has limited its possibilities. Brands like Ax Water and Tohi have integrated the North American-grown berry into RTD beverages by mixing them with other juices and natural sweeteners, while Health-Ade Kombucha uses it in its Maca Berry product. It has even emerged in frozen fruit blends and jams alongside more familiar fruits as a way to introduce consumers to the ingredient.

The challenging kids’ beverages space will also evolve and possibly mature this year, Coons claimed, with brands like Rethink focusing on limiting sugar and and Hellowater integrating fiber into its products. Teas and natural drinks are also an emerging trend for kids, with brands such as Play Tea, Drazil, and Roar Organics’ Roar Kids, which has a licensing deal with Marvel, being examples.

Consumers’ increased interest in mitochondria health, driven by interest in the keto lifestyle, will bring new attention to supplements supporting everything from heart health to cognitive function. Coons predicted that cellular health ingredients like L-carnitine and alpha lipoic acid could soon appear in RTD beverages and functional foods.

Sleep support products are another trend expected to rise in popularity, according to Hochman, particularly in the form of small format beverages such as Snoooze’s Natural Sleep Drink and Pure Indian Foods’ Herbal Brahmi Ghee.

Consumers have also shown concern for ocean health, which drove the 2018 trend of passing on plastic, Hochman noted, and in the new year this concern for aquaculture will be channeled into fish-free seafood products from brands like Good Catch, as well as snacks like fish skins and seaweed.

Looking ahead, Coons and Hochman offered “quick picks” of what would be on their radar for Expo West. They predicted that wild-sourced ingredients will start to appear more in chocolate, tea and snacks, and regenerative agriculture will emerge as a priority for brands with a sharper focus on farmers and workers in the supply chain, with Hochman citing Loving Earth’s chocolate as an example. Coons predicted that the influence of keto at Expo West will be similar to that of paleo in 2014, and that keto-friendly dessert products will lead the charge this year. In the CBD space, Hochman stated that infused RTD beverages, chocolates and gummies will likely see a surge. Another functional ingredient gaining traction is bacopa, notable for its cognitive health benefits, which Coons stated will soon start to pop up in food and beverages.",SPINS 2019 Trend Predictions Webinar Recap

Founder Jon Sebastiani told NOSH the additions are reflective of how the firm has evolved since its inception, adding both to its portfolio of investments and owned properties: marshmallow brand Smashmallow, egg brand Peckish and drinkable chilled soup brand Zupa Noma.

Recently, Kevin Murphy joined the firm as a managing director. Murphy spent 13 years at Encore Capital, as one of the earliest employees of the firm. Murphy, a friend of Sebastiani’s since his Krave days, told NOSH that after departing Encore last summer, he was drawn to the operator-focused investment thesis that Sonoma offered brands.

“I saw true investment capability with a building track record, but coming from different perspectives than what we normally see with a traditionally structured investment firm,” Murphy said.

Joining Murphy as managing director is Brian Nicholson, who joined Sonoma as a principle in January 2018. Nicholson brought with him a focus on ecommerce, digital media and direct-to-consumer businesses, having spent five years with Stripes Group, leading the firm’s investments in Refinery29, Reformation and The Black Tux.

Those digital skills will benefit not only Sonoma’s investments, which include direct-to-consumer kids meal plan Yumble, but also Sonoma’s own brands. Zupa Noma, for example, went from being sold in brick and mortar stores to an ecommerce focus. Sebastiani cited a struggle to connect and educate consumers on retail shelves as the cause for the change.

Peckish has also focused on digital, as it has taken a more measured approach to its launch. The brand first entered California’s Erewhon in January before rolling out in Equinox locations in the Northeast, Whole Foods’ 365 stores and direct-to-consumer via its website.

“With Peckish we’re building a different value proposition, so [we’re going] much slower,” Sebastiani said. “Peckish was a brand that we’re going to slowly bleed out into the marketplace into very influential accounts.”

Peckish’s rollout comes as the brand has also undergone staffing changes. In December, Peckish CEO and Sonoma Brands Chief Brand officer Chelsea Bialla departed the company. Sebastiani told NOSH that Bialla had departed for “personal reasons” but her “fingerprints are all over our brands.” To fill the vacancy, Lauren Egan has been promoted to VP of Brand and the Sonoma Brands team is assisting with operations and the day-to-day management of the business. It’s a testament, Sebastiani said, to the Sonoma team.

“Having a tremendously complimentary, collaborative group of people that are accretive in their backgrounds and talents to each other is just sensationally important,” Sebastiani said.",Sonoma Brands Sees Management Additions

The Hamilton, Ontario-based craft brewery, located about 50 miles from the New York border, has established a sister company called Collective Project Limited that will develop and sell cannabis-infused beverages.

In a conversation with Brewbound, CEO and co-founder Matt Johnston said the new line of THC- and CBD-infused beverages would be “artisanal” in nature, and could include non-alcoholic beer, as well as cold brew coffee or tea.

“Our company was founded on creativity and innovation,” he said. “We like to play and try new things.”

Johnston said the company, which already distributes its beers in 12 U.S. states, is aiming to launch hemp-based CBD beverages in the U.S. this summer.

However, Collective Project Ltd. must wait until at least October 17 before it can introduce cannabis-infused beverages into the Canadian market, as edible and drinkable products are not currently permitted for legal sale.

Nevertheless, Collective Project Ltd. is pushing forward with a plan to produce its infused beverages in the U.S., and it is in the process of establishing “potential partnerships on the supply and co-packing side of the cannabis world,” Johnston said.

The company is also planning to make a multi-million dollar investment on dealcoholization equipment, which will be used to produce non-alcoholic beer infused with THC and CBD, Johnston said.

Collective Arts, which produced fewer than 50,000 barrels of beer in 2018, according to Johnston, currently distributes beer to New York, Illinois, Tennessee, Vermont, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Florida, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Virginia, the U.K., and Sweden. It is planning to expand sales of its beer to New Jersey, Indiana, Ohio, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Spain, Norway and China in 2019.

Johnston said the Collective Project Ltd. sister company would look “more holistically” at “marrying the footprint” for its CBD-infused products while focusing on West Coast states such as California and Oregon where recreational cannabis is legal for distribution of its THC-infused products.

"Despite a 5 percent increase in organic sales in the fourth quarter, The Coca-Cola Company’s poor 2019 outlook resulted in the company’s largest single day drop in stock price since 2008 following its Q4 and full year earnings report.",2019-02-14,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/25172754/coke_full1.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/coke-poor-outlook-hits-stock-price-despite-solid-q4,"Despite a 5 percent increase in organic sales in the fourth quarter, The Coca-Cola Company’s poor 2019 outlook resulted in the company’s largest single day drop in stock price since 2008 following its Q4 and full year earnings report.

In the report, released before the market open this morning, Coke predicted a disappointing 4 percent organic revenue growth in 2019. CEO James Quincey blamed the muted full-year projection — which is one point lower than in 2018 — on global volatility including currency headwinds and rising tax rates. Earnings per share (EPS) are estimated to range from plus 1 percent to minus 1 percent. Following the report, Coke’s stock price opened the day with a 7 percent drop, ultimately declining 8.38 percent (4.17 points) by the end of the day to a value of $45.59 per share.

“Looking ahead, we’re seeing the impact of some increasing uncertainty and volatility in global macroeconomic conditions,” Quincey told investors. “Consumers are under more pressure as we head into the New Year. However, demand for our categories remained healthy and our business is built to perform even if the tailwinds behind us moderate somewhat. Ultimately we will focus on what we can control taking steps to manage the business as we become a total beverage company.”

Net revenues declined 6 percent to $7.1 billion in the fourth quarter and were down 10 percent to $31.9 billion for the full year, a result of fluctuating currency rates and costs associated with Coke’s refranchising of its company-owned bottlers, which it completed last year.

Despite the net loss, Coke’s growth rates outperformed expectations. Operating income grew 21 percent for the quarter and 14 percent for the full year. Rebrands for Diet Coke and Coke Zero Sugar also led to strong performances; Diet Coke saw a 3 percent increase in retail value growth after years in decline and Coke Zero Sugar reported double-digit volume growth. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said the company’s “ability to deliver a strong topline” suggests its “refranchising [and] portfolio transformation are paying off.”

Sparkling soft drinks grew 2 percent overall for the year and declined 1 percent for Q4. Juices, dairy, and plant-based beverages declined 1 percent for the year and 2 percent for the quarter. Water, enhanced water, and sports drinks grew 3 percent for the year and 1 percent in the quarter. Tea and coffee grew 1 percent for the year and 3 percent in the quarter.

Speaking to investors on the call, Quincey noted portfolio expansions in 2018 will help Coke to compete in the shifting beverage marketplace, highlighting the company’s decision last year to take a minority stake in sports drink brand BodyArmor, as well as its $5.1 billion purchase of international cafe chain Costa Coffee. He noted the acquisition gives Coke “the ability to scale within the $500 billion global hot beverage category” and also “strengthen our ready-to-drink portfolio. He later clarified that the company is exploring the potential for Costa-branded RTD products.

Responding to a question from Herzog during the conference call, Quincey said Coke expects to continue growing in non-CSD categories in the U.S., including in iced tea, where brands like Gold Peak and Fuze Tea are expected to see “more balanced growth.” In water and hydration, the company plans to focus on the “more premium” parts of the category with brands such as Smartwater, Topo Chico, and BodyArmor.

Quincey credited brands such as Fuze Tea with driving growth in non-CSD categories, noting that Coke’s broader portfolio will help the company deliver in 2019 despite lowered expectations.

“Further lifting, shifting and scaling entrée brands like Fuze Tea, Smartwater and [U.K. based smoothie brand] Innocent across markets, reformulating products to reduce sugar levels, rolling out revenue growth initiatives across additional territories to improve performance within our sparkling soft drink portfolio, connecting costs across many of our business units build a leading global coffee business and leveraging digitization to build a business for the future,” Quincey said. “Therefore, we feel confident that we can deliver against our 2019 guidance.”",Coke: Poor Outlook Hits Stock Price Despite Solid Q4

Before the market opened this morning, the Purchase, N.Y.-based soda giant reported organic revenue grew 4.6 percent in Q4 and 3.7 percent for the year. Projected full-year organic revenue growth is 4 percent, though earnings will be impacted by an approximate 3 percent increase in the company’s 2017 core effective tax rate. PepsiCo also expects to return approximately $8 billion to shareholders in 2019, with dividends of around $5 billion and share repurchases of around $3 billion.

Within North America Beverage (NAB), revenue was up 2 percent in Q4 and 1 percent for the year. Operating profits in the segment were down in both Q4 (-16 percent) and for the whole of 2018 (-16 percent).

“We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2018,” said CEO Ramon Laguarta in a press release, noting the company “met or exceeded each of the financial objectives we set out at the beginning of the year.

“We are well positioned in large, growing categories and have developed strong and relevant capabilities over the years. In 2019, we aim to capitalize on the momentum we have as we enter the year, and to continue to invest in the capabilities that will better position us for success for years to come.”

In sharing details about cost cutting measures set to roll out over the next several years, Laguarta, who succeeded Indra Nooyi in October, gave investors an indication of how the company will look under his leadership. PepsiCo is aiming to generate at least $1 billion in productivity savings annually through 2023, an extension of its previous target of $1 billion in annual savings through the end of 2019.

The restructuring actions, which will include pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion ($1.6 billion cash portion) through 2023, are aimed at helping the company “leverage new technology and business models” and to “re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems.” In Q4, the company incurred $138 million in restructuring charges.

A majority of these charges, according to PepsiCo, will go towards severance pay and other “employee-related costs” related to planned plant closures. Speaking to Bloomberg, CFO Hugh Johnston did not offer details of how many jobs were at risk, but noted some cuts could be related to a shift to automation programs.","PepsiCo: 2018 Q4, Yearly Revenues Up As Restructuring Looms"

Available for purchase in Oregon, Washington and California in March, both are expected to expand nationally later this spring. These two products will join SakéOne’s premium Oregon Craft saké portfolio alongside bottles of g, Momokawa and Moonstone.

Inspired by the impressive growth of craft beer and premium wine in cans, SakéOne sees tremendous potential to make saké more approachable, convenient and eco-friendly with this new format. The 250ml recyclable aluminum slim cans have a pop-top lid (the same as soda cans and canned wine and beer products) and eye-catching designs meant to grab consumers’ attention on the retail shelf.

Yomi is a new concept created by SakéOne specifically for canned saké. It is wrapped with a white label featuring a striking image of a Japanese mask inspired by mythology and brought to life by a local Portland designer originally from the Aomori Prefecture of Japan. According to Shinto mythology, Yomi means “World of Darkness” or “an Afterlife” where one goes after death. This story inspired the company to create a saké meant to be consumed in our daily “world of darkness” at the end of each day.

The Momokawa offering represents the newest line extension from SakéOne’s pioneering flagship brand. Created by in-house designers, the design features a white canvas with stylized blue accents inspired by an avant-garde form of calligraphy known as zeneisho and the abstract expressionist style of Jackson Pollock.

“While both offerings feature eye-catching art on the outside, the true art is on the inside,” said president and CEO Steve Vuylsteke. “Brewmaster Takumi Kuwabara and his team have been working tirelessly to craft the ideal style for each of our new canned sakés. Our hope is that the convenient, eye-catching cans appeal to both newcomers and devoted saké drinkers. We wanted to create something new, different and approachable in a format with which consumers are already very comfortable.”

Both Yomi and Momokawa are Junmai Ginjo, or super premium level saké made with no distilled alcohol added. They are crafted using premium Sacramento Valley rice milled to 58 percent of its original size. Removing the outer impurities of the rice grain and focusing on the ideal starch found within each grain results in clean, fruity and floral aromatics. Pristine, abundant Willamette Valley water utilized in the production process is essential to revealing and retaining fruity “ginjo” characteristics.

Driven in particular by demand for its canned, 100-percent gluten-free Fabrizia’s Italian Margarita, which was introduced in spring 2018, Fabrizia Spirits will move from a 1,800-square-foot facility to a nearby 6,000-square-foot space, allowing for expanded production and enhanced efficiency. Fabrizia Spirits products, including its award-winning Limoncello, are now sold in 18 states nationwide.

“Fabrizia Spirits continues to experience double-digit, year-over-year growth and increased demand for our products, including the new canned version of our Italian Margarita, driving our need for additional space,” said Phil Mastroianni, co-owner of Fabrizia Spirits. “We’re pleased to be making this move, which will position us for 2019 and beyond, especially as we continue to add new product offerings.”

Family-owned and operated, Fabrizia Spirits began renovations on the new facility located at 2 Industrial Way in Salem in January and expects to move into the new space by the end of February.

The additional floor space will allow Fabrizia Spirits to include a separate canning area, eliminating its impact on production. As part of the move, Fabrizia Spirits is purchasing new equipment, including a 1,500-gallon automatic stainless-steel mixing tank, three 500-gallon stainless-steel mixing tanks, and an 8-foot by 10-foot walk-in freezer. The expanded space will allow for more efficient processing of all Fabrizia Spirits products, particularly as the company receives shipments of about 140,000 Sicilian lemons at a time.

Due in large part to the success of the canned Fabrizia’s Italian Margarita, Fabrizia Spirits experienced 45-percent sales growth in 2018, compared to the previous year. Fabrizia Spirits is aiming for30-percent sales growth in 2019. Fabrizia Spirits saw case sales jump from21,000 cases sold in 2017 to more than 41,000 cases sold in 2018—an increase of more than 70-percent. Fabrizia Spirits is aiming to surpass 50,000 cases sold this year.

Co-owners and brothers Phil and Nick Mastroianni developed Fabrizia’s Italian Margarita from a family recipe. The premium cocktail is made with Fabrizia’s Limoncello, freshly-squeezed lemonade made from Sicilian lemons and premium tequila. The Italian Margarita is made without added colors, flavors or preservatives.

Fabrizia Spirits began operations in 2008, featuring its flagship, all-natural Limoncello. In addition to Limoncello and Fabrizia’s Italian Margarita, Fabrizia Spirits also offers a Blood Orange liqueur, and a limoncello cream liqueur called Crema di Limoncello.

"In a webinar entitled “Cannabis Legalisation: How It Will Disrupt the Future” hosted by market research company Euromonitor International on Thursday, Shane MacGuill, head of tobacco research, and Spiros Malandrakis, head of alcoholic drinks research, looked at several ways in which cannabis will likely disrupt the tobacco and alcohol industries as well as how these industries can adapt.",2019-02-15,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/15165319/Euromonitor_Full-Width_1.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/euromonitor-cbd-personalization-set-to-drive-cannabis-market,"In a webinar entitled “Cannabis Legalisation: How It Will Disrupt the Future” hosted by market research company Euromonitor International on Thursday, Shane MacGuill, head of tobacco research, and Spiros Malandrakis, head of alcoholic drinks research, looked at several ways in which cannabis will likely disrupt the tobacco and alcohol industries as well as how these industries can adapt.

While the cannabis industry is less than a quarter of the size of the tobacco and alcohol markets, it is expanding at a faster rate. The U.S. cannabis industry, including legal and illegal sales, was worth $150 billion in 2018, while its market grew by 40 percent, according to Malandrakis. Meanwhile, tobacco and alcohol have seen stagnant growth of around 1 percent.

In looking at the current global cannabis regulations, MacGuill noted that legalization and development are faster in the west than the east, though he expected quick growth with a spread of legal medical and recreational cannabis to spread to the east by 2030.

A major trend in alcoholic drinks is mindful drinking, Malandrakis noted, making the development of alternatives necessary as consumers cut down on consumption or choose low ABV options.

The beer industry has previously experimented with CBD but has often been hampered by miscommunication and misunderstanding of its proper usage, Malandrakis said, citing Black Hammer Brewing’s since-recalled Toke Back Mountain as an example. He also cited Blue Moon creator Keith Villa’s Grainwave, a de-alcoholized craft beer infused with cannabis available in Colorado, as indication of ongoing innovation within the beer industry.

According to Malandrakis, the alcohol industry could potentially lose market share to cannabis, as the two share similar consumer demographics, use occasions and retail positionings, and thus are often combined or substituted for one another. Malandrakis added that, one in four people who have consumed alcohol in the past week have also consumed cannabis, and one in five suggest they seamlessly substitute cannabis for alcohol.

Malandrakis outlined several issues currently limiting the ability of cannabis to compete with the alcohol industry. Despite fears of cannabis cannibalizing booze, he stated that “The Distill Spirits Council suggests that per capita in Washington, Oregon and Colorado, the longest standing recreational markets in the US, have not been hurt by legalization,” as canna-tourists also partake in alcohol consumption. As for cannabis beverages, the onset effects remain questionable as THC is not water soluble, and can take one to two hours to be felt, meaning further research and innovation is needed.

Still, Malandrakis predicted that the next generation of commercial cannabis products, expected to emerge as early as Q4 2019, will speed up the cannabilization of alcohol as production becomes more standardized and consistent with Canada serving as the products’ testing ground. The ultimate result, he stated, will see the cannabis and alcohol industry merge into a “holistic responsible intoxication” industry.

As cannabis companies slowly begin to establish their respective brands, Malandrakis discussed how emerging products should focus on sensations and effects (“relaxation” or “romance,” for example) rather than often difficult-to-pronounce strains.

Products such as edibles and beverages with low potency and a focus on lifestyle will widen the potential cannabis demographic beyond stereotypical “stoners.” He noted that older females are the strongest growing demographic as products have become more normalized and are increasingly used to treat pain and insomnia.

MacGuill noted that synthetic cannabinoids are also on the rise. Terpene manipulation, “the sourcing of cannabinoids beyond CBD and THC that might only exist naturally in negligible quantities,” along with the potential for producing more predictable and affordable cannabis products, are the main drivers for synthetic formulations, he said.

Malandrakis also highlighted cannabis’ potential to be hyper-customizable due to strain and profile variety. CBD, he said, is just “the tip of the iceberg” of cannabinoids: Delta 8 provides a nuanced experienced ideal for recovering addicts or the elderly; THCv, an appetite suppressant, could open the door for “skinny” cannabis products and lifestyle-focused alcoholic drinks; and CBN, the potential next CBD, is more stable than THC and has similar therapeutic benefits. When these are paired with terpenes, a substantial amount of personalized and functionally optimized combinations can be created.

Malandrakis concluded the webinar by touching on a few products which serve as indicators of future trends.

These products ranged from functional supplements to convenience plays to purely recreational items. Myrcene Hemp Gin, a terpene-infused English gin, is an example of botanical cross-pollination, blurring the lines between the cannabis and alcohol industries. CBD-infused detox shot Sober Up is a post-alcohol hangover solution. Canopy Growth and Constellation are developing a yet-to-be-named non-alcoholic, THC-infused, zero calorie adult beverage.

Meanwhile, Francis Ford Coppola Winery’s The Grower Series, announced in November, is a collection of cannabis flower strains and smoking accessories offered in wine-shaped packaging, indicating cannabis’ potential for premium positioning. Finally, MariMed Inc. is developing a dissolvable THC tablet for beverages, a product that, according to Malandrakis “could disrupt the entire beverage category.”

Malandrakis also noted that the dispensaries of the future, such as social outlet and eatery Namaste Cafe, will take an experiential approach to education, allowing the cannabis industry to engage in discussion-based education which he noted has been a shortcoming of the alcohol industry.","Euromonitor: CBD, Personalization Set to Drive Cannabis Market"

The Texas based whiskey company finished 2018 delivering more than 30,000 cases and driving over 5,000 points of distribution across 12 states, and it does not look like the brand will be slowing down anytime soon.

The Devils River Whiskey ownership group is looking to expand distribution across the entire country. “Our goal is to be in more than 30 states by the end of 2019,” said Devils River Whiskey’s president and co-founder Mike Cameron. “Leading the aggressive expansion plan requires a strong team,” said Cameron. “We’re assembling a great group of the right men and women to get this done. We have divided the country into five regions and are proud of the talent that we’re bringing together to drive our market expansion.”

Industry veteran John Potts recently joined the Devils River Whiskey leadership team as the executive vice president of sales and marketing. Potts is a Texas native with a strong track record of recruiting, building and leading national sales teams. He was one of the original members of the Deep Eddy Vodka team and was instrumental in leading the brand from launch through its eventual sale to Heaven Hill. Prior to leading the Deep Eddy team, Potts held multiple leadership roles at Republic National Distributing Company. “I’m thrilled to be leading sales and marketing for this ambitious undertaking,” said Potts.

Senior vice president of marketing Eric Hundelt was one of the first employees hired by Devils River Whiskey and is continuing to drive the Devils River Whiskey’s marketing efforts across the country. Prior to joining Devils River Whiskey, Hundelt held a variety of senior level sales and marketing roles with brands like Angels Envy, Bacardi and Cabo Wabo tequila. The sales team will be divided into five regions. Matt Thornton was hired as regional vice president of the Texas Region. Brendon Walsh will serve as regional vice president of the Northeast Region. Rick Perez will lead sales in the south as the regional vice president of the Southeast Region. The company will be announcing appointments for the Midwest and West regions in the very near future.

In anticipation for the expected growth, the company will be opening its San Antonio based distillery in October 2019. “We are in the processes of renovating the first two floors of the Burns building located at 401 E Houston Street.” Built in 1918, the Burns building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. “We are excited to be part of San Antonio’s downtown revitalization as our distillery and visitor’s center will be in the heart of downtown San Antonio, blocks from the Alamo,” said Cameron.

Devils River Whiskey is extremely proud of its award-winning portfolio. 90-proof Devils River Bourbon launched in 2017 and was followed by the release of two new expressions, 90-proof Devils River Rye and 117-proof Devils River Barrel Strength Bourbon. Over the last 18 months the Devils River Whiskey brands have been awarded 22 medals of which nine were gold, one double gold and its rye was awarded Rye of the Year. “Our whiskies have been recognized as one of the best whiskies aged less than ten years according to some of the most prestigious whiskey competitions,” said Hundelt. “We’re primed for success and ready to share Devils River Whiskey with even more of the country.”

"The International Brotherhood of Teamsters claimed today that strategic decisions made by Coca-Cola bottler and distributor Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling (RCCB) “have created significant disruption in the quality of service” for customers in Southern California, according to the results of a survey of over 100 retailers.",2019-02-13,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/13170517/Coke_teamsters_fullwidth.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/teamsters-survey-finds-signficant-disruption-in-socal-coke-distribution,"The International Brotherhood of Teamsters claimed today that strategic decisions made by Coca-Cola bottler and distributor Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling (RCCB) “have created significant disruption in the quality of service” for customers in Southern California, according to the results of a survey of over 100 retailers.

RCCB, which services accounts in California and Nevada, is one of the numerous operators across the country to take over regional bottling and distribution following the completion of Coke’s national refranchising campaign in 2017. Reyes Holdings, the distributor’s Illinois-based parent company, also operates Great Lakes Coca-Cola Bottling; Martin-Brower Company, a food service distributor servicing McDonald’s and other brands; and the Reyes Beverage Group, one of the country’s largest beer wholesaler operations. According to the Teamsters, Reyes currently employs over 5,000 active union members across its company portfolio.

Greg Nowak, director and secretary-treasurer of the Teamsters Brewery & Soft Drink Workers’ Conference, shared key takeaways from the survey during a call “for investors and industry analysts” held this morning. Compiled from retailers in the greater Los Angeles and San Diego metro areas in November 2018, the survey included questions about “changes to delivery schedules, whether stores are adequately stocked with Coke product, and if Coke sales have been impacted by the changes,” according to the Union. According to the Union, feedback came from both large format grocery stores (such as Vons, Ralphs, and Albertsons) and gas stations, 7-11s and independent markets.

Of the 107 completed surveys returned, 39 percent of respondents reported inadequate inventories for Coke products, while 40 percent of retails said their costs have increased since the changeover.

Meanwhile, 56 percent of retailers said the changes implemented by Reyes have affected sales across the soda giant’s product portfolio anywhere from 15 to 50 percent. Retailers also complained about the distributor refusing refunds or credits for expired or damaged products.

“The new distribution system in Southern California—which Reyes intends to roll-out in Northern California in the coming weeks— has significantly reduced the number of Coca-Cola salesmen, merchandisers as well as Teamster drivers and warehouse workers with some members moving over to Pepsi or other unionized companies,” he said.

Nowak blamed the shift to a “static routing system” for cutting some customers’ deliveries by half, forcing smaller stores in particular to purchase and hold more product and also take over the burden of responsibility for rotating products and monitoring codes. About 18 percent of respondents said Reyes is not delivering all of the same SKUs on its new schedule.

Nowak added that Reyes’ policies have “reduced the number of Coca-Cola salesmen, merchandisers as well as Teamster drivers and warehouse workers” that has caused some members to move to PepsiCo and other unionized companies, but did not provide specifics. He also criticized the timing of the changes, noting that the combination of service cuts and Coke’s move to increase prices at the end of last year was puzzling. In addition, Teamster contracts covering over a thousand California Coca-Cola workers are set to expire this year and next year.

“These changes have impacted customer service, hurt morale among frontline employees, and created tension with the Teamsters Union ahead of upcoming contract negotiations,” Nowak said.

Addressing investors directly, he emphasized that the Union is voicing its criticism in order to “protect the Coca-Cola brand and the quality service customers have come to expect.”

“We hope you will join us in urging Coca Cola to intervene and demand that Reyes restore quality service and good jobs before expanding this experiment any further,” he said. “Our interests are aligned with yours.”

In a statement shared with BevNET, a spokesperson for RCBB stated that the new operating model is “focused on providing the highest quality products and consistent and reliable customer service” while reducing its environmental footprint. Since implementing that model, according to the spokesperson, it has “increased overall market share in California against our principal competitors.”

“This proven operating model has enabled our growth within the Coca-Cola system and in other parts of the Reyes Holdings business, including in foodservice and beer distribution,” the company said in an email. “In addition to fueling our continued growth, we firmly believe the model helps us standardize and simplify our RCCB operations, thus freeing up resources that can be reinvested in our people, technology, facilities, and fleet. This makes our business, and our customers’ businesses, more sustainable and brings us one step closer to achieving our vision.”","Teamsters: Survey Finds ""Significant Disruption"" in SoCal Coke Distribution"

"Colorado-based kombucha maker Rowdy Mermaid has raised $3.5 million in a Series A round led by private investment firm KarpReilly, the company announced today.",2019-02-18,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/18172814/Rowdy_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/rowdy-mermaid-raises-3-5m-in-series-a,"Colorado-based kombucha maker Rowdy Mermaid has raised $3.5 million in a Series A round led by private investment firm KarpReilly, the company announced today.

Founded by CEO Jamba Dunn in 2013, Rowdy Mermaid has slowly grown from an out-of-home operation to placement in more than 500 retail stores throughout the West Coast, Rocky Mountain and Midwest regions, including Whole Foods, Natural Grocers, King Soopers and Gelson’s Markets. The company’s current product portfolio includes six SKUs that utilize functional ingredients promoting benefits such as digestion, immunity, and relaxation.

Speaking to BevNET, Dunn said the company had previously avoided fundraising by limiting its growth, turning down multiple opportunities to rapidly scale in favor of maintaining independence. He said he plans to use the new funds to hire sales and marketing specialists to expand distribution, build stronger relationships with existing retailers, and to “re-evaluate the brand and the audience.”.

By taking a slower approach, Dunn said Rowdy Mermaid struggled to find like-minded investors in the past, largely due to demands from potential backers for the brand to rapidly expand its footprint and create a strong exit valuation. Dunn, however, said KarpReilly was agreeable to Rowdy Mermaid’s mission to foster an independent brand and develop the growing market space for “functional kombucha” products.

As part of the deal, KarpReilly co-founder Allan Karp will join Rowdy Mermaid’s board of directors.

“It’s really fascinating to me to see how many big CPG companies are jumping into kombucha right out of the shoot,” Dunn said. “I guess the going strategy right now is to inject money into a small company and try to increase ACVs and go for global domination. That was never our approach, we want to continue to try to grow the business by building strong relationships and creating a better product to better serve our audience.”

According to Dunn, Rowdy Mermaid plans to build the brand’s presence in the conventional and convenience channels, but will also focus on adding food service accounts including schools and universities and vending.

“We see that there’s a lot of white space out there [for kombucha] that hasn’t been properly addressed yet,” he said. “But we think that taking the current product, and the current look and feel, that was mostly built for the natural channel and just putting that into conventional isn’t the right approach.”

Dunn said the company is also planning to switch to a clean supply chain for ingredients and adopt sustainable packaging, which might potentially involve moving away from its current 12 oz glass bottle format. Rowdy Mermaid is also working with brand strategy firms to refine the company’s target consumer base before the new packaging arrives on the market this summer.

Rowdy Mermaid also maintains an in-house genetics research lab which the company uses to study the bacteria found in kombucha in order to better control flavor, alcohol production, and sugar levels, which Dunn said was a selling point for KarpReilly and that the firm is supportive of the brand’s scientific arm.

“He really has the same desires as we do that food can change not only people, but environments as well,” Dunn said of Allan Karp. “He’s got the same desires as we do, so I look at him as a really strong partner. I can call him up at any time of the day and get his advice on the move we’re making. I don’t see it all as being somehow managed by the capital investment whatsoever.”",Rowdy Mermaid Raises $3.5M in Series A
"– Califia Farms, best known for its innovative plant-based beverages in distinctive curvy bottles, continues breaking barriers on “What Plants Can Do” with the launch of Übermilk, a nutritious line of oat milk beverages that go above and beyond to deliver a good source of protein and other essential nutrients. Available Spring 2019 in three varieties – Unsweetened, Unsweetened Vanilla and Chocolate – the Übermilks have 8 g of plant-based protein per serving including all eight essential amino acids and fatty acids from plant oils for omegas 3, 6 and 9, as well as calcium, iron, vitamin D, potassium and vitamin E.",2019-02-19,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/18160849/bd6ff519862de7c918a9-137x320.png,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/califia-farms-launches-ubermilks-oatmilk-line,"LOS ANGELES– Califia Farms, best known for its innovative plant-based beverages in distinctive curvy bottles, continues breaking barriers on “What Plants Can Do” with the launch of Übermilk, a nutritious line of oat milk beverages that go above and beyond to deliver a good source of protein and other essential nutrients. Available Spring 2019 in three varieties – Unsweetened, Unsweetened Vanilla and Chocolate – the Übermilks have 8 g of plant-based protein per serving including all eight essential amino acids and fatty acids from plant oils for omegas 3, 6 and 9, as well as calcium, iron, vitamin D, potassium and vitamin E.

Due to increasing environmental and personal health concerns, the food industry is experiencing a seismic shift as more consumers globally reject ultra-processed “big food” products and start to experiment with a more plant-based lifestyle. Protein enhanced non-dairy milks have nearly doubled in sales over the past year as consumers look for more plant-based protein sources. Califia Farms’ Übermilks not only tap this growing trend but also the rising popularity of oat-based milks. Oatmilk alone is up 168 percent over the past year.

“Übermilk is a leap into the next frontier,” said Greg Steltenpohl, founder and CEO of Califia Farms. “Nutritionally Übermilk is one of the more nutrient dense plant milks on the broader market with a powerful combination of both macro and micro nutrients, and most importantly it wins on taste and texture, thanks to our naturally creamy and great-tasting Oatmilk serving as the base.”

Leveraging Califia Farms’ new oat-based milk made from whole grain, gluten-free oats, the Übermilks combine eights grams of complementary plant-proteins from pea, oats and sunflower seeds with all eight essential amino acids. They are also rich in fatty acids from flax and sunflower oil to deliver nutritionally significant quantities of Omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids per 8 oz. serving. To round out the nutritional profile, the Übermilks are also an excellent source of calcium and vitamin D derived from mushrooms as well as a good source of iron, potassium and vitamin E. The new Übermilks join Califia Farms’ existing line of plant-based milks including almond, coconut, cashew and oat.

“Made from a blend of seeds and pulses, Übermilk removes any compromise for anyone seeking better nutrition from plants,” said Ashley Koff, RD and CEO of The Better Nutrition Program. “I’m equally impressed with the nutrient density and taste.”

Beginning Spring 2019, Übermilk will be available at Whole Foods Market stores nationwide with additional distribution throughout the year. Übermilk will also be available on CalifiaFarms.com, and a preview will be available at Natural Products Expo West in Anaheim, California (March 7-9, 2019, booth #5192).

Beginning May 2019, Califia Farms will also roll out refreshed Nitro Draft Latte packaging with a new twistable, re-sealable cap. Califia Farms was the first to introduce a completely dairy free, nitro-infused Cold Brew Coffee in 2016. The Nitro Draft Latte Cold Brews are available in three flavors – Latte, Mocha and New Orleans – that marry creamy almond and macadamia milks with cold brew made from direct-trade beans and an infusion of nitrogen to bring out the natural sweetness in a silky micro-foam.

The refreshed Nitro Draft Latte will be available for tasting at Natural Products Expo West, booth #5192, along with Califia Farms new Übermilks, Oatmilk, Oat Barista Blend and a wide assortment of other plant-based milks, ready-to-drink coffees, probiotic dairy free yogurts, dairy free creamers and citrus juice.

Inspired by the legend of Califia, the beautiful black Queen and namesake of California, Los Angeles-based Califia Farms was founded in 2010 and has become one of the fastest-growing natural beverage companies in the U.S. Renowned for offering the best-tasting plant-based beverages on the market artfully packaged in disruptive curvy bottles, Califia is a leading refrigerated plant milk, dairy free creamer, ready-to-drink coffee and probiotic dairy free yogurt brand in the natural and specialty channels.

The digital campaign, WHY #NOLIMEEMOJI? asks consumers to join Spindrift in the effort to give the unsung hero of citrus its long overdue limelight by sharing why they love lime on social media using the hashtag #NoLimeEmoji.

“The launch of Spindrift Lime is a direct response to requests from the Spindrift community. Our fans are always submitting new flavor ideas and lime has long been one of the most popular requests,” said Bill Creelman, founder and CEO of Spindrift. “Lime is actually the most popular flavor in the flavored sparkling water category, but Spindrift is the first brand with scale to make it with real squeezed lime juice.”

In the excitement to tell the world about the new flavor release, the team noticed that there was a whole basket of fruit emojis – but no lime. Even with the most recent release, there is still no lime emoji. Enlisting the help of their community, Spindrift looks to rally those on social media seeking to complete their citrus expression with the tiny lime emoji. To support Spindrift’s commitment to giving back, during the WHY #NOLIMEEMOJI? campaign, Spindrift will donate $1 for every Instagram or Twitter post using #NoLimeEmoji to Whole Kids Foundation (up to $50,000 dollars) between Feb. 19 and March 31, 2019, 12:01 a.m. EST.

“As a brand that is making the transition from start-up to household name, we have relied heavily on social media to tell our brand story and keep our loyal fans in the loop on brand news. As we were developing plans for the lime launch and saw that the lime emoji didn’t exist, we resolved to help fix the oversight, while highlighting one of our favorite non-profit partners,” Spindrift SVP of Marketing, Caroline Kibler explained.

“Up until today, if someone asked me to rate my love of Spindrift on a scale of 1-10, I would have said 10 immediately. But then they brought Lime to my table and now I have no choice but to rate it at a gajillion,” said actress Kristen Bell. “Sometimes you don’t know what’s missing from your life (or fridge) until someone hands it to you. Spindrift has come up with a fun, creative idea for sharing their new Lime flavor and I’m totally on board with #NoLimeEmoji. How could there possibly be two apple emojis and no lime? That’s just bonkers. But what I really love is their give back program for every #NoLimeEmoji hashtag that gets posted. It’s good for your texts and good for your soul – win, win!”

People can join the campaign by sharing all the ways they’d utilize a lime emoji – if they had one – on social media. Photos of guacamole, margaritas, key lime pie and more should be posted with the hashtag #NoLimeEmoji. Spindrift will use these submissions as part of their proposal to Unicode in the hopes of correcting this small injustice and bringing an official lime fruit emoji to the world in the next emoji release.

“While we want to create buzz around Lime and help lime earn emoji status – at the end of the day, the true focus should be on real ingredients. Whole Kids Foundation provides children across the country with access to healthy, fresh fruits and veggies. We’re proud to support this cause because raising awareness for simple, real ingredients is always the most important thing to us,” said Kibler.

The WHY #NOLIMEEMOJI? campaign launches today alongside the debut of the Spindrift Lime flavor. Spindrift Lime will be available starting in late February 2019 on Amazon, The Spindrift Market and in select retailers, including Target and Kroger this spring. Spindrift is also showcasing the new flavor at this year’s Natural Products Expo West (booth #5531).

KeyLeaf has completed more than 5,400 projects for clients in nearly 50 countries over the past four decades and is transitioning its business model to deliver greater value to its partners.

Pivoting away from applied contract R & D work to producing finished plant-based ingredients of all types under our new name (KeyLeaf) reflects a strategic move toward commercializing a pipeline of plant-derived products under our own brand. The new business model is also anticipated to take advantage of burgeoning market opportunities and produce consistent growth, said POS/KeyLeaf president and CEO, Dale Kelly.

Kelly said KeyLeaf will retain its culture of profound expertise, innovation and demonstrated success in creating novel, value-added, plant-based protein, starch and lipid-based ingredients through commercialization leveraging KeyLeaf team know-how.

With over four decades of high-level proficiency in plant extraction, concentration, isolation and modification of material properties, the company will monetize soaring interest in the emerging hemp and cannabis category with proprietary extracts of cannabinoids, terpenes and other high-value components for use in medicinal or nutritional applications, said Kelly.

Kelly said the new corporate name is anticipated to better define the value proposition of the company, allow for better acceptance with new potential clients in trending markets, while positioning the brand to be more reflective of its new direction. Most importantly, it will facilitate the enhanced focus on a new brand of value-added, novel plant-based ingredients.

KeyLeaf’s ability to provide finished ingredients to the larger food, supplement, flavor, cosmetic, pharma and advanced materials industry is a natural extension of the company’s previous model of engagement in partnerships that showcased its unmatched ability to scale from bench to high volume commercial production, with the capacity to process from grams to tons-per-week of finished extracts.

In the 1970s, POS Pilot Plant Corporation took canola from the fields as its first project and virtually created the entire North America canola oil industry. We then did the same with soybeans. We are currently doing it again with legumes and hemp. No other company in the world has comparable innovative technology and expertise to take raw materials from the farm and convert into top-grade plant-based functional ingredients on any scale required, said Kelly.

This exceptional ability is a great source of pride for every KeyLeaf team member.

With a staff of 135 skilled scientists, technicians and operators manning facilities in Saskatoon, Canada, and Batavia, Illinois, POS Bio-Sciences/KeyLeaf is a global leader in the creation of value-added products from biological materials.","POS Bio-Sciences Rebrands as KeyLeaf, Plant-Based Ingredient Supplier"

"Driving consumers to make repeat purchases is a critical piece of long-term success in the beverage industry. But for the founders of PathWater, the less you buy the better.",2019-02-19,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/19175341/PathWater-Full-Width_1.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/brand-profile-pathwater-seeks-to-reroute-pet-water,"Driving consumers to make repeat purchases is a critical piece of long-term success in the beverage industry. But for the founders of PathWater, the less you buy the better.

Founded in 2015, PathWater is a California-based water brand packaged in reusable and recyclable aluminum bottles intended as an environmentally-friendly alternative to single-use beverages. The company’s mission-oriented founders say they’re not overly concerned with the brand’s profit margins, but are instead seeking to launch a “revolution” that will reduce plastic waste and curb the beverage industry’s carbon footprint.

“There is no Planet B,” PathWater co-founder and VP of marketing Ali Orabi told BevNET. “Why are we spending so many valuable resources into knowing what’s out there in the universe when we can’t even take care of our own Planet A? So that’s the whole idea behind it… We’re not really in it to make money, we’re in it to make a change.”

Sustainability has been a significant concern for the bottled water category in recent years. Brands utilizing carton packaging, such as JUST Water and Boxed Water, have made sustainability and protecting the environment the core of their brand identities, but still rely on traditional volume growth models. PathWater is priced in line with other premium water brands at $2.89 per 740 mL bottle and $2.29 per 600 mL.

Speaking with BevNET, co-founder and CEO Shadi Bakour said he believes consumers are increasingly seeking alternatives to single-use plastic products and that PathWater fills a white space for those shoppers. Although the company emphasizes reusability, Bakour said early market data shows that the average consumer refills their bottle about five times before recycling.

“Everything we do is backed by our mission, we put profits second,” Bakour said. “We believe if we do the right thing then the profits will come.”

Currently PathWater is available in about 4,000 stores across 12 states, including Safeway, Gelson’s, Jensen’s, and 7-Eleven chains. According to Barkour, the company’s current key markets are in California, but that the brand is rapidly expanding in the Pacific Northwest and Southwest regions. The brand has also targeted on-premise accounts, including schools, gyms, yoga studios, and corporate cafeterias. The brand has distribution through KeHE and multiple DSD distributors.

Orabi noted that the brand’s decision to use aluminum over reusable plastic ensures the bottles are “100 percent recyclable.” However, the material choice also impacts the product’s margins. Bakour admits the metal is not inexpensive, noting the price of raw materials has only gone up since the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese imports in 2017. Despite this, the brand has maintained a lower price point in order to remain competitive within the water category.

“In order for us to be a true competitor and a true solution to this problem, we cannot price ourselves out of the market,” Bakour said. “So we’re willing to take a little bit of a hit on our margin in order to be able to offer it at the right price.”

Bakour said the packaging also acts as a marketing tool, as consumers who carry the bottle with them help drive sales via word of mouth.

According to Bakour, PathWater is targeting major growth in 2019. The company has partnered with New Hope to sponsor next month’s Natural Products Expo West 2019 trade show in Anaheim, Calif., where it will serve as the Official Water with multiple on-site sampling locations, refilling stations, and bottles will be placed in attendees hotel rooms.

PathWater has also brought in experienced industry veterans to help scale the brand, adding both Healthy Brand Builders founder James Tonkin and a representative of manufacturer Unix Packaging to its board of directors. As well, Bakour said private equity firm Black Bear Founders is leading a Series A funding round in the brand.

“I love the platform which is ‘right on the money’ regarding sustainability, recyclability, refill ability, and reusability — no other bottle water can make this claim,” said Tonkin, whose experience in the water category includes executive positions at Essentia and Icelandic Glacial, in an email to BevNET.

Tonkin, who has invested in the company, called the PathWater’s focus on sustainability “right on the money” for the industry, adding that he is encouraged by the brand’s initial market penetration in schools and that he believes the Expo West sponsorship will be the brand’s “real coming out party.”

PathWater has also brought in celebrity investors, most recently announcing the addition of Washington Redskins tight end Vernon Davis, who promotes the brand while touring schools across the country. Other celebrity investors include chef and reality TV star Guy Fieri, actress Tamera Mowry, and basketball player Festus Ezeli.

The brand’s next step, Bakour said, is to scale nationwide. The company is targeting expansion in the natural channel and is approaching the major retailers in the space, including Sprouts and Whole Foods, with Bakour adding he believes the growth rate will take off after Expo West with a goal to quadruple the brand’s revenue in 2019. PathWater is also exploring new innovations in both the water category and in additional categories, although there are no immediate plans to launch new products.

“When you hold a beverage in your hand, and you’re walking around with it, you’re showing the world who you are,” Bakour said. “So it goes way beyond just what you want in your body, it’s about how you want to be perceived by others. So when you’re holding a bottle of PathWater, it’s not only another bottle of water — it’s a badge of honor your can carry with you to say you care about the environment. You’re not only buying this bottle, this your lifestyle.”",Brand Profile: PathWater Seeks to Reroute PET Water

Built and designed in-house by the creative team at Silencio, the one-of-a kind branded space will feature cutting-edge technology, experiential storytelling moments, as well as a beautiful — and very hidden – speakeasy, which will become an immersive experience like no other to the few who are lucky enough to find it. In addition to its innovative construction and design, Mezcaleria El Silencio will also give fans a hands-on opportunity to experience the rich heritage and artisanal craftsmanship of Silencio via exclusive cocktails on tap. Patrons can expect classic cocktails with a Silencio twist, all curated specifically for the bar and with Galaxy fans in mind. Complete with first-class service, premium cocktails and tastings, Mezcaleria El Silencio will bring LA Galaxy fans the ultimate game day experience.

“El Silencio is a best-in-category partner that shares our commitment not only to growing the sport of soccer, but also to elevating the fan experience for our loyal Galaxy fans,” said Robert Vartan, senior director, AEG Global Partnerships. “Working together through this first-of-its-kind partnership, we look forward to elevating the game day experience and adding value to our fans with their topnotch mezcal offerings and unconventional activations.”

The sports market in Los Angeles has grown exponentially over the last decade as the home to 11 professional and major college franchises. Despite the highly saturated and competitive landscape, the LA Galaxy has been able to stand out, growing both its team and fan base into one of the most passionate and highly engaged audiences in the entire MLS. With both the club and soccer being major points of interest for Angelenos, the LA Galaxy represents a significant opportunity to introduce the Silencio brand to soccer-loving fans. Using soccer as a passion point, the partnership will help Silencio engage its target audience and strengthen its ties to the dynamic sports community across Southern California. Additionally, the new relationship will aim to reinforce Silencio’s status as a world-class mezcal and creator of unforgettable game-day experiences.

The partnership also includes enhanced brand presence for Silencio across the LA Galaxy and numerous Dignity Health Sports Park assets. As the exclusive mezcal partner, El Silencio will receive in-stadium and in-game visibility during each club MLS regular season home game. El Silencio will also have the opportunity to engage local soccer fans via brand-tailored activations at Dignity Health Sports Park throughout the course of the agreement.

As an official partner of The Roxy Theater, The Shrine Auditorium, The Fonda Theater and The El Rey Theater, Silencio will also be strategically integrated throughout the live event experience at all four music venues. Fans can expect to see the mezcal label brought to life via vibrant signage and various consumer touch points, including promotions, custom drink opportunities, engaging experiential activations and immersive events that allow fans to experience the Silencio brand up close and personal.

Mezcal El Silencio revived the ancient art of mezcal, pioneering a unique approach and delivering the hand-crafted spirit to a new generation of creative drinkers and cultural innovators. Founded in Santa Monica in 2013, the company creates its mezcal in Oaxaca, Mexico, using the traditional process carried on by generations of mezcaleros. Meticulously picked agaves are roasted, crushed and double distilled resulting in a full-bodied flavor. El Silencio goes beyond the bottle, transforming the ordinary and disrupting the status quo.

Yet while some companies are racing to expand and innovate, Blue Bottle, one of the most admired coffee roasters and retailers in the world, is taking a patient and restrained approach.

“Our way is not the right way if we want to be the most commercially successful company in the country. Meehan said in an interview included in this episode. “There are companies ahead of us that are doing more innovation. But I think our way is the right way if we think about the long-term value of the brand and what taste we deliver to our customers.”

That perspective is embraced by Blue Bottle’s majority owner, Nestlé, which in September 2017 paid approximately $500 million for a 68 percent stake in the company. Meehan remarked that Nestlé views Blue Bottle as “doing something very unique and should not be touched.”

“Throughout the whole culture of Nestlé, there’s support to just (let) Blue Bottle be,” he said.

As part of our conversation, we spoke with Meehan about how Blue Bottle’s new line of whole bean coffee in pressure-sealed cans fits into its purposeful innovation strategy. He also discussed the evolution of Blue Bottle’s cafe and beverage business and the company’s efforts to enhance consumers’ experience with coffee and his perspective on the future of packaged coffee drinks and the industry as a whole.

When advising entrepreneurs on how to build a foundation for success online, Goldin encourages them to keep it simple.

“Whether you’re a $500,000 brand or you’re a $1 billion brand, start small,” she said in an interview included in this episode. “Launch a small website… and make it really simple to transact. If you start with ‘the consumer controls your destiny,’ make it easy. Think about your own life. People are really busy.

"Capitalizing on strengthening demand among American consumers, The a2 Milk Company has announced expanded sales agreements with leading supermarket chains Kroger and Albertsons/Safeway. These additions complete the company’s goal of achieving national geographic distribution in the U.S. market.",2019-02-20,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/19171038/79b0e79b182536aac6b2.png,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/the-a2-milk-company-announces-national-distribution,"BOULDER, Colo.– Capitalizing on strengthening demand among American consumers, The a2 Milk Company has announced expanded sales agreements with leading supermarket chains Kroger and Albertsons/Safeway. These additions complete the company’s goal of achieving national geographic distribution in the U.S. market.

Starting this month, a2 Milk branded products will begin to appear on the shelves of additional Kroger stores and Albertsons/Safeway stores, bringing the company’s total distribution to approximately 12,400 outlets operated by 80 major grocers across the country. a2 Milk is already available at other leading retailers including Costco, Walmart, Ahold, Sprouts Farmers Market and Whole Foods Market. Sales velocities in both new and existing accounts have accelerated, and total store distribution has increased by almost 45 percent since November 2018.

“The a2 Milk Company couldn’t be more thrilled with the expanded partnerships that we have secured with two of the leading supermarket chains in the U.S.,” said Blake Waltrip, CEO of The a2 Milk Company U.S. “The acceptance of the a2 Milk innovative proposition continues to be a true validation of our products and our benefit to consumers. Signing on with Kroger and Albertsons/Safeway will allow a2 Milk products to gain additional exposure in new markets, bringing us closer to our goal of giving every American consumer the chance to enjoy the nutritious benefits of real milk.”

This significant expansion comes at a time of tremendous international growth for the Australian headquartered dairy nutrition company. At the company’s half year results announcement, the company announced total revenue of $613.1 million (NZ $) and a 52.7 percent gain in operating EBITA. In addition, the company reported that the U.S. region’s momentum continued with sales growth of 114.1 percent in the half underpinned by increased investment in brand awareness and a stronger distribution base.

Recent U.S. research data indicates the U.S. brand development looks a lot like the experience with fresh milk in Australia with the a2 Milk brand in the U.S. successfully growing category consumption, sourcing volume across multiple product segments and trading up consumers from conventional milk while demonstrating high levels of consumer loyalty once the brand is trialed.

The a2 Milk Company will now seek to further extend its geographic reach into other parts of the U.S. including the Southwest, West, Pacific Northwest and Midwest as well as throughout its more established markets in California, the Northeast and the Southeast.

Ordinary cows’ milk naturally contains a mix of two main types of beta-casein proteins, A1 and A2 protein types. Published research suggests that a2 Milk may help avoid stomach discomfort in some people because it contains only the A2 protein type and no A1.

The a2 Milk Company works with local U.S. dairy farmers to identify cows that only naturally produce the A2 protein type and process their milk separately, making it possible for some with sensitivities to enjoy real cows’ milk. The a2 Milk Company pays a premium to all its farmers and all U.S. farms are certified by Validus for animal welfare.

The a2 Milk Corporation was founded in 2000 in New Zealand by Dr. Corran McLachlan after a scientific research showed that proteins in milk affect people differently. Specifically, he noted that ordinary cows produce milk contains 2 different beta-casein protein types, called A1 and A2. Since its foundation the company has flourished in its home market Australia, where it is the leading premium milk brand with over 10 percent of the total supermarket milk category and more recently has become market leader in infant formula with about 33 percent value share. This success has also translated into the China market with 5.6 percent share of the lucrative China infant formula category estimated to be approximately USD $18 billion. a2 Milk products include Whole, 2 percent Reduced Fat, Chocolate 2 percent Reduced Fat and 1 percent Low Fat.

"Anheuser-Busch InBev is finally making an acquisition in San Diego, but it’s not a craft brewery.",2019-02-20,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20140551/Cutwater_AB_fullwidth.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/anheuser-busch-to-acquire-fast-growing-cutwater-spirits,"Anheuser-Busch InBev is finally making an acquisition in San Diego, but it’s not a craft brewery.

The world’s largest beer company today announced the purchase of fast-growing Cutwater Spirits, a craft distilling venture that was originally born inside of Ballast Point Brewing & Spirits.

Specific financial terms of the deal – A-B InBev’s first in the spirits space — were not disclosed. The transaction, which is for 100 percent of the Cutwater business, is expected to close this spring, a spokesperson told Brewbound.

Founded by former Ballast Point Brewing executives Yuseff Cherney (then-COO), Earl Kight (then-CCO) and Jim Buechler (then-CEO), along with investment from Ballast point founder Jack White, Cutwater operates a sprawling 50,000 sq. ft. distillery, tasting room and kitchen in San Diego’s Miramar neighborhood, which is home to numerous craft breweries, including Ballast Point.

The company manufactures 14 different ready-to-drink canned cocktails, which carry a suggested retail price of as much as $16.99 per 4-pack, and distributes to 34 states. It also makes 16 types of spirits, according to a press release.

Speaking to Brewbound, Brendan Whitworth, A-B’s vice president of sales in North America, said the acquisition of a spirits company would help the beer giant better compete in non-beer categories.

“We are first and foremost a beer company,” he said. “That being said, we want to be sure we are present where all consumers are. That includes adjacencies within beer, and different segments that are emerging.”

Whitworth, who expressed excitement about the future growth possibilities of the Cutwater’s canned cocktails, said he was drawn to the acquisition opportunity because of the company’s “innovative and disruptive approach.”

According to off-premise retail data from Nielsen, dollar sales of Cutwater’s spirits products grew 203 percent during the 52-week period ending January 26.

Meanwhile, dollar sales of the company’s RTD cocktails grew a whopping 356 percent and far outpaced the single-serve spirit-based cocktails segment (+66.2 percent) during the same period, Nielsen added.

Kight, who serves as Cutwater’s chief sales and marketing officer, attributed the company’s rapid growth in part to a retail-driven expansion strategy.

“We went where the chains were asking for us,” he told Brewbound. “If consumers are looking to buy it, I am going to be there.”

For his part, Cherney said Cutwater’s fast success was a “perfect storm,” pointing to hiring the right people to push an in-demand product at the right time.

“I think it is a magical team that puts stuff like that together,” he said.

After manufacturing and selling a variety of products under the Ballast Point Spirits label, Cutwater was formally established in mid-2016, about one year after Ballast Point sold to Constellation Brands and all four of the smaller spirits company’s founders departed the New York-headquartered alcohol company.

In 2017, Cutwater opened its production facility, which includes a continuous column still, barrel-aging capabilities, a high-speed canning line capable of filling 350 cans per minute and a bottling line that can fill 70 bottles per minute.

“Yuseff and the operations folks can drown me in booze if they want to,” Kight said jokingly.

Cutwater will be part of A-B’s Beyond Beer portfolio, which was created last July and includes the company’s Ritas, Bon & Viv spiked seltzer, Babe Rosé and HiBall brands.

There are no immediate plans to alter Cutwater’s current distribution footprint, Whitworth said, noting that the company would look to use A-B wholesalers for future market entries.

“Right now, the near-term objective is to keep the current route to market and minimize disruption,” he said. “As we expand, we obviously believe in the power of the A-B network, and state-by-state that is the preference.”

Although this is the first spirits acquisition for A-B, the company isn’t totally unfamiliar with the space. Two of its U.S. craft breweries – 10 Barrel Brewing in Oregon and Devils Backbone in Virginia – also have distilling capabilities.

Founder Jon Sebastiani told NOSH the additions are reflective of how the firm has evolved since its inception, adding both to its portfolio of investments and owned properties: marshmallow brand Smashmallow, egg brand Peckish and drinkable chilled soup brand Zupa Noma.",,https://d2azl42aua8mom.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/12183450/Sonoma_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.nosh.com/news/2019/sonoma-brands-sees-management-additions,"Over the past two months, investment group and incubator Sonoma Brands has seen changes to its operating team including the addition of two managing directors. Founder Jon Sebastiani told NOSH the additions are reflective of how the firm has evolved since its inception, adding both to its portfolio of investments and owned properties: marshmallow brand Smashmallow, egg brand Peckish and drinkable chilled soup brand Zupa Noma.

Recently, Kevin Murphy joined the firm as a managing director. Murphy spent 13 years at Encore Capital, as one of the earliest employees of the firm. Murphy, a friend of Sebastiani’s since his Krave days, told NOSH that after departing Encore last summer, he was drawn to the operator-focused investment thesis that Sonoma offered brands.

“I saw true investment capability with a building track record, but coming from different perspectives than what we normally see with a traditionally structured investment firm,” Murphy said.

Joining Murphy as managing director is Brian Nicholson, who joined Sonoma as a principle in January 2018. Nicholson brought with him a focus on ecommerce, digital media and direct-to-consumer businesses, having spent five years with Stripes Group, leading the firm’s investments in Refinery29, Reformation and The Black Tux.

Those digital skills will benefit not only Sonoma’s investments, which include direct-to-consumer kids meal plan Yumble, but also Sonoma’s own brands. Zupa Noma, for example, went from being sold in brick and mortar stores to an ecommerce focus. Sebastiani cited a struggle to connect and educate consumers on retail shelves as the cause for the change.

Peckish has also focused on digital, as it has taken a more measured approach to its launch. The brand first entered California’s Erewhon in January before rolling out in Equinox locations in the Northeast, Whole Foods’ 365 stores and direct-to-consumer via its website.

“With Peckish we’re building a different value proposition, so [we’re going] much slower,” Sebastiani said. “Peckish was a brand that we’re going to slowly bleed out into the marketplace into very influential accounts.”

Peckish’s rollout comes as the brand has also undergone staffing changes. In December, Peckish CEO and Sonoma Brands Chief Brand officer Chelsea Bialla departed the company. Sebastiani told NOSH that Bialla had departed for “personal reasons” but her “fingerprints are all over our brands.” To fill the vacancy, Lauren Egan has been promoted to VP of Brand and the Sonoma Brands team is assisting with operations and the day-to-day management of the business. It’s a testament, Sebastiani said, to the Sonoma team.

“Having a tremendously complimentary, collaborative group of people that are accretive in their backgrounds and talents to each other is just sensationally important,” Sebastiani said.",Sonoma Brands Sees Management Additions
"Internationally inspired nuts, better-for-you booze and a sesame surge are among the several emerging food and beverage trend predictions for 2019 that were highlighted in a webinar hosted by data technology company SPINS on Wednesday.",,https://d2azl42aua8mom.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/08171152/Spins_fullwidth_NOSH.jpg,https://www.nosh.com/news/2019/spins-2019-trend-predictions-webinar-recap/,"Internationally inspired nuts, better-for-you booze and a sesame surge are among the several emerging food and beverage trend predictions for 2019 that were highlighted in a webinar hosted by data technology company SPINS on Wednesday.

Led by Jessica Hochman, senior manager of natural insights and innovation research, and Brent Coons, director of natural insights, the presentation outlined food and beverage trends to watch in the year ahead along with quick picks of possible trends to watch for at Expo West.

Coons noted several alcohol trends to watch out for this year. He highlighted bitters as an emerging force in the natural products industry, as consumers’ palettes expand and the mixers category moves beyond high fructose corn syrup. Brands such as Hella Cocktails and Bitter Love have launched ready-to-drink options, which will make bitters more accessible to consumers as mocktails or mixers, according to Hochman.

“New-school alcohol” products like hard kombucha and hard seltzer have also found success as part of the better-for-you booze trend, Coons noted, predicting that craft brewers could soon get in on the action. Canned sparkling wine and cocktails is also a developing segment of note, with brands like Saturday Session and Cocktail Squad getting into the lower ABV trend.

Paleo-friendly products are now a half billion dollar segment, and 2019 will see the diet trend go more mainstream while still producing innovative grain-free non-dairy products, according to Coons. Kellogg’s acquisition of RXBar and Kraft Heinz’s acquisition of Primal Kitchen both indicate that larger companies are betting on this trend to last.

Internationally inspired nuts and seeds including the baruka and pili nuts are gaining popularity in snack brands like Pili Pushers, Coons stated, especially as they fit into on-trend paleo and keto diets. Coons predicted that these nuts could soon pop up in nut butters and plant-based beverages. Hochman also added that water lily seeds have gained momentum with brands like Rooted Food Co as a popcorn-like snack.

Despite its status as a known allergen, Hochman predicted 2019 will be the “Season of Sesame,” as the ingredient has appeared in milks, coffee blends and ice cream. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not consider it to be among the top eight allergens, Hochman claimed it might further evaluate that stance this year as 300,000 Americans are allergic to sesame.

Aronia berries are also a new ingredient trend, with Coons comparing the berry’s rise to consumers’ past embrace of gogi and acai berries. Though they have been previously seen in juice concentrates, aronia’s bitter flavor profile has limited its possibilities. Brands like Ax Water and Tohi have integrated the North American-grown berry into RTD beverages by mixing them with other juices and natural sweeteners, while Health-Ade Kombucha uses it in its Maca Berry product. It has even emerged in frozen fruit blends and jams alongside more familiar fruits as a way to introduce consumers to the ingredient.

The challenging kids’ beverages space will also evolve and possibly mature this year, Coons claimed, with brands like Rethink focusing on limiting sugar and and Hellowater integrating fiber into its products. Teas and natural drinks are also an emerging trend for kids, with brands such as Play Tea, Drazil, and Roar Organics’ Roar Kids, which has a licensing deal with Marvel, being examples.

Consumers’ increased interest in mitochondria health, driven by interest in the keto lifestyle, will bring new attention to supplements supporting everything from heart health to cognitive function. Coons predicted that cellular health ingredients like L-carnitine and alpha lipoic acid could soon appear in RTD beverages and functional foods.

Sleep support products are another trend expected to rise in popularity, according to Hochman, particularly in the form of small format beverages such as Snoooze’s Natural Sleep Drink and Pure Indian Foods’ Herbal Brahmi Ghee.

Consumers have also shown concern for ocean health, which drove the 2018 trend of passing on plastic, Hochman noted, and in the new year this concern for aquaculture will be channeled into fish-free seafood products from brands like Good Catch, as well as snacks like fish skins and seaweed.

Looking ahead, Coons and Hochman offered “quick picks” of what would be on their radar for Expo West. They predicted that wild-sourced ingredients will start to appear more in chocolate, tea and snacks, and regenerative agriculture will emerge as a priority for brands with a sharper focus on farmers and workers in the supply chain, with Hochman citing Loving Earth’s chocolate as an example. Coons predicted that the influence of keto at Expo West will be similar to that of paleo in 2014, and that keto-friendly dessert products will lead the charge this year. In the CBD space, Hochman stated that infused RTD beverages, chocolates and gummies will likely see a surge. Another functional ingredient gaining traction is bacopa, notable for its cognitive health benefits, which Coons stated will soon start to pop up in food and beverages.",SPINS 2019 Trend Predictions Webinar Recap

Hormel Foods Corporation has ,2019-02-20,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20115508/Cytosport_fullwidth2.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/hormel-agrees-cytosport-deal-to-pepsico,"Hormel Foods Corporation has announced a deal to sell CytoSport to PepsiCo, as the company behind the Muscle Milk brand looks for a new start less than five years after its acquisition by the food conglomerate.

Financial terms of the transaction were not immediately released, but will be detailed during Hormel’s earnings call tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. ET, according to a press release.

CytoSport, founded in 1998, was acquired by Hormel in a deal valued at $450 million in 2014. The company markets a variety of protein-focused sports nutrition products under the Muscle Milk brand, including powders, ready-to-drink beverages and bars. In 2017, it launched a parallel brand platform for plant-based protein products, Evolve.

The acquisition, Pepsi’s first under new CEO Ramon Laguarta, gives the soda and snack giant another legacy brand that will allow it to further expand its product offerings. Within the Pepsi portfolio, CytoSport products will feature alongside Gatorade, which in recent years has broadened its offerings to include protein-based powders, RTDs and bars. Pepsi also purchased Health Warrior, which markets sports nutrition powders and bars, for an undisclosed sum in October 2018.

“PepsiCo has deep expertise and experience in the sports nutrition category and has been a long-standing distribution partner for CytoSport and the Muscle Milk brand, which puts them in a strong position to grow this dynamic business,” said Hormel president and CEO Jim Snee in a press release. “We look forward to working with PepsiCo to ensure a smooth transition for our team members, suppliers, customers and consumers.”

In an email to BevNET, a PepsiCo spokesperson said: “We look forward to welcoming CytoSport to the PepsiCo family.

The brand has officially introduced its expanded line-up, which includes six new flavors that meet consumers’ demand for exciting bubbly options and alternatives to sugary beverages.

The innovative new Poland Spring Sparkling varieties feature unique flavor profiles that tap into trending tastes. New flavors include: Ruby Red Grapefruit, Lemon Ginger, White Peach Ginger, Blood Orange Hibiscus, Orange Mango and Vanilla Flavor Twist. In fact, a growing appeal for floral flavors among consumers landed hibiscus as 2019’s “flavor of the year,” while lemon and grapefruit are among the top three sought-after sparkling flavors.

Poland Spring Sparkling is made from 100 percent natural spring water from Maine, real fruit flavors and refreshing bubbles, reflecting the brand’s commitment to using simple ingredients. Because it is what is on the inside that counts and not the hype around it, the real Maine spring water inside Poland Spring Sparkling distinguishes it from other bubbly brands and underscores the brand’s deep connection to the local source.

“After the incredibly positive response to the 2018 relaunch of Poland Spring Sparkling, we are excited to maintain momentum with new flavor options,” said Yumiko Clevenger-Lee, VP and CMO of Nestlé Waters North America. “As we continue to expand our portfolio of unique and healthy sparkling offerings, our core focus remains unchanged and unmatched; simple ingredients starting with the 100% natural spring water Poland Spring has been known for since 1845.”

The six newest flavors add to the existing line of refreshing Poland Spring sparkling flavors, which also includes: Lively Lemon, Lemon Lime, Zesty Lime, Orange, Triple Berry, Summer Strawberry, Raspberry Lime, Black Cherry, Pomegranate Lemonade and Simply Bubbles. All Poland Spring Sparkling offerings are sugar-free, calorie-free and contain no sweeteners or colors.

To support the launch of its new expanded flavor line, Poland Spring Sparkling is rolling out an online campaign in the upcoming weeks that will run in digital and on social channels. Creative assets will lean into nature and highlight the brand’s key differentiators – the 100 percent natural spring water, natural flavors, refreshing bubbles and great taste.

New Poland Spring Sparkling will be available later this month in a mix of three bottle sizes – 20 oz. 1 liter, and .5 liter (8-packs) – as well as 12-oz. cans (8-packs). The waters can be found in-store at supermarkets, club, convenience and chain drug stores in the Northeast region. The products are also available for purchase and delivery through ReadyRefresh by Nestlé as well as on Amazon, FreshDirect and Walmart.com. For more information about Poland Spring Sparkling, visit polandspring.com/sparkling-water.

Consumers outside of the Northeast can enjoy all these great sparkling flavors under other Nestlé Waters North America brands – each featuring 100 percent natural spring water: Deer Park, Zephyrhills, Ozarka, Ice Mountain and Arrowhead.

Established in 1845, Poland Spring Brand 100 percent Natural Spring Water has been served throughout the northeast for more than 170 years. With deep roots in the community, Poland Spring Brand is committed to helping make its home state of Maine a great place to live and work.

Sleep, this week. The new product launch commences the company’s expansion from the fastest-growing hydration company in the world, to 360-degree wellness brand. Liquid I.V. notably leverages Cellular Transport Technology (CTT), the same breakthrough science used in their original Hydration Multiplier product, in the new nighttime drink mix.

Like Hydration Multiplier, Liquid I.V. Sleep comes in easy-to-use, portable sticks. Liquid I.V. Sleep has been clinically tested and shown to get more Melatonin and L-Theanine into the bloodstream after just 15 minutes, compared to a leading competitor. Liquid I.V. Sleep is available exclusively on Liquid-IV.com.

“What makes our original product, Hydration Multiplier, so effective at delivering water to the bloodstream is the use of CTT,” said Liquid I.V. founder and CEO Brandin Cohen, in an Instagram story on Monday. “We started testing CTT early on and realized this innovative science could get key functional ingredients into your bloodstream more efficiently than anything else out there.”

Liquid I.V. Sleep contains a specially-formulated proprietary Sleep Blend including Melatonin, L-theanine and Valerian root, and is the first sleep product on the market to use CTT to deliver these ingredients rapidly into the bloodstream. In the new product’s clinical study, the Sleep Blend showed up in the bloodstream after just 15 minutes—a remarkable feat for an all-natural sleep aid.

Liquid I.V. Sleep has been praised online as customers begin to use it, some in conjunction with Hydration Multiplier. “I love this brand!” wrote Taylor, 35, a self-described “active mom,” in a review on the company’s website. “I found Liquid I.V. Sleep after having used their Hydration Multiplier product for years. Now I take the sleep product to go to bed at a reasonable hour and wake up feeling refreshed. This company has actually saved me—there’s no way I’d be able to get everything done without their products!”

Liquid I.V. Sleep will also further the company’s global Giveback Mission. “For every purchase of Liquid I.V., we donate one serving to a person in critical need around the world. That includes Liquid I.V. Sleep as well as our original Hydration Multiplier,” Cohen said. Customers who purchase Liquid I.V. products will be sending a serving to places like El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Armenia and India, as well as communities in the U.S. affected by natural disasters.

“Our culture is rooted in helping people everywhere, and as our product line expands, so does our mission. Our status as a 360-degree wellness brand is underscored by our relentless passion for bringing wellness to the world.” The company recently surpassed one million servings donated worldwide and is on track to surpass two million by June of this year.

Liquid I.V. Sleep is now exclusively sold on the company’s website, Liquid-IV.com, and will be pushed out to stores nationwide later this year.

Liquid I.V. is a health-science nutrition and wellness company based out of El Segundo, California, created to fuel life’s adventures. The product line is great tasting, non-GMO, made in the USA and utilizes Cellular Transport Technology (CTT) to deliver hydration and other key nutrients rapidly into the bloodstream – helping consumers feel better, faster.

La Colombe will present an array of new flavors and concepts including a line of ready-to-drink cold brew shandy, as well as their new multi-serve format, at their booth at Expo West: Hall B, booth 1575.

“We are always in search of what coffee can become and that is something that continuously drives us. At EXPO we will be presenting the next evolution of coffee,” said Todd Carmichael, CEO and co-founder of La Colombe Coffee Roasters.

La Colombe’s cold brew 42 oz. multi-serve is the first and only cold-brewed, cold-filled, large format coffee. Expertly roasted with a long legacy of high-quality coffee, La Colombe’s cold brew allows you to make your coffee just the way you like it from the comfort of your own home.
• Cold Brew Brazilian Medium/Dark Roast: Single origin, fully washed and sun-dried coffee beans from Brazil, this medium roast retains the naturally bold and nutty flavors of Brazilian coffee.
• Cold Brew Colombian Light Roast: Single origin, fully washed and sun-dried coffee beans from the Sierra Nevada Mountains of Colombia, this coffee is roasted lighter to retain the naturally sweet effervescence of high-quality Colombian coffee.

“Multi-serve is something we’ve been thinking about for a while, but we waited until we could invent the technology to fill a bottle without heating up the plastic. It’s official. We have cracked that code,” shared Carmichael. “Ultimately what this is about is bringing home the absolute best cold brew coffee in America, to your refrigerator. We wanted to break down that wall where we become part of your morning routine and allow you the ability to customize your beverage how you like it.”

Leaning into their legacy of coffee sourcing and roasting, La Colombe decided to focus on the flavor profile of citrus in their newest innovation, noting that citrus is a tasting note that is present in most high elevation, higher scoring coffee. Therefore, it was a natural fit for La Colombe to pair the smooth taste of cold brew with the refreshing citrus of lemons, grapefruit and cherry. Nitrous-infused and made with light roasted Colombian organic coffee, La Colombe’s shandy collection offers a bright, refreshing flavor.

Made with light-roasted Colombian organic coffee and lemonade from lemons sourced from centuries-old groves along the Mediterranean coast in Sicily, Cold Brew Shandy Lemonade, a ready-to-drink beverage, brings a refreshing taste to the afternoon.
• Cold Brew Shandy Grapefruit: Made with light-roasted Colombian organic coffee and real pink grapefruit juice, this beverage offers a thirst-quenching pick-me-up.
• Cold Brew Shandy Cherry: Created with cherry sourced near from La Colombe’s production facility in Michigan, this cold brew shandy perfectly marries the light-roasted Colombian organic coffee with the tart taste of cherry.

“What we wanted this project to become is a coffee that is chug-able. This is not your average coffee. It’s the Arnold Palmer of coffee. It truly defies the limitations of the time of the day. This is an all-day kind of drink,” added Carmichael.

In addition to La Colombe’s newest 9 oz. ready-to-drink and 42 oz. multi-serve menu offerings, which will be available on tap, La Colombe will also be offering Oatmilk Draft Latte on-tap.

The total ready-to-drink coffee category is $4.1 billion in annual sales, and is growing at an average rate of 12 percent across all channels. In the grocery channel, La Colombe’s ready-to-drink beverages lead the category growth at 130 percent. The multi-serve segment is crowing 2x that of the total category growth, indicating consumers are also looking for ready-to-drink solution for their at-home needs.

Since the inception of the Draft Latte in 2017, Draft Latte has gained over 55,000 points of distribution nationwide and has achieved more than 51 percent ACV (Total US MULO). Due to La Colombe’s unique “innovalve” technology, which adds to the frothy experience, 66 percent of La Colombe first-time purchases are new to the ready-to-drink coffee category.4 All of this makes La Colombe one of the fastest growing ready-to-drink brands in the world.

Atkins began his career in 1990 with The Perrier Group, later transitioning to the Nestlé Waters system and holding various management positions before taking the VP role in 2014.

In an email to BevNET, Q Mixers founder and CEO Jordan Silbert said the tenfold growth Nestlé Waters experienced during Atkins’ tenure with the company mirrors the “kind of explosive growth” the premium carbonated mixer category is currently experiencing. Silbert noted that recent IRI data showed the category up 58 percent over 52 weeks, and up 64 percent over 24 weeks.

“We’re actually taking dollars away from mainstream mixer brands as that category continues to decline,” Silbert told BevNET. “Mike’s experience will help us accelerate growth even more rapidly.”

Silbert also noted Atkins is one of many executives recently recruited by Q Mixers from leading water, spirits, and beer companies.

“[Atkins will start] with elevating our key retailer partnerships, optimizing our channel strategies, and further developing the extraordinary team we already have in place,” Silbert said. “Mike fits right in with our current roster of all-stars who have seen the potential and have chosen to join us from brands like Campari, William Grant, Boston Beer, Lotus Foods, Fairway Market, VOSS Water, and Fiji Water.”

Former PepsiCo general manager Walter Cybulski has joined antioxidant water brand Napa Hills as VP of Sales, the company announced this week. The Chicago-based brand uses a proprietary technology to make wine-inspired functional drinks.

Speaking to BevNET, Napa Hills managing partner Steve Jarvis said Cybulski recently joined Napa Hills after 25 years with PepsiCo to fill the needed sales leadership position.

“[Founder and CEO Ellona Jarvis] is the product developer and inventor Napa Hills and the passionate brand advocate for what we’re doing, while my background is in marketing,” Jarvis told BevNET. “We’ve been looking for someone with the right credential and who shares our values to fill a senior position in sales and distribution, so we were delighted when we were introduced to Walter. He just understands the retail landscape, he understands how to create win-win situations for the brand and the retailers, and really speaks their language.”

Jarvis said Cybulski has developed stronger relationships with retailers on the West Coast, which Napa Hills is currently targeting as a key growth market for the brand.

“We’re excited to have him on board,” Jarvis said. “His role is VP of sales, but he’s involved with us in all kinds of meetings and discussions, beyond just the sales piece.”

Diageo-backed spirits accelerator Distill Ventures announced this week the hiring of Nicolas Proszenuck as investment director. Based in New York, Porszenuck will lead new investments and work with the firm’s current portfolio of spirits and non-alcoholic beverage brands.

“We are thrilled to welcome Nicolas to the growing Distill Ventures team here in the U.S.” said founder and managing director Gonzalo De La Pezuela in a press release. “As we continue to bring new entrepreneurs into the [Distill Ventures] portfolio and nurture existing brands, Nicolas will play a vital role in ensuring we create the best possible partnerships and outcomes for our brands.”

Lisa Chang has been named The Coca-Cola Company’s new chief people officer in charge of global human resources, effective March 1.

According to a press release, Chang comes to the company from her prior role as senior vice president and chief human resources officer for AMB Group LLC, the investment management and shared services arm of The Blank Family of Businesses which owns the Atlanta Falcons NFL team.

Chang will be based in Coke’s Atlanta headquarters. She is replacing Jennifer Mann, who was promoted recently to the role of president of global ventures.",People Moves: Q Mixers Taps Nestlé Talent

Flavored water is not a universal language.,2019-02-25,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/25173728/AguaLucha_fullwidth.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/cool-factor-can-aguas-frescas-seize-their-moment,"Ask for a “flavored water” at a U.S. grocery retailer, and you’ll be promptly directed to an aisle stocked with bottled products ranging from vitaminwater to Hint to private label brands. However, ask for a “flavored water” at a store in Mexico and you may be directed to step outside and buy a freshly made “agua fresca” from a street vendor, who can often be found ladling it out by the spoonful from large glass containers.

Yet even as flavored water continues to be among the fastest growing beverage categories in the U.S., aguas frescas haven’t quite been able to enjoy the same success, despite repeated attempts by some of the industry’s biggest manufacturers to crack the market with a ready-to-drink product. Yet after years of fits and starts, that could be in the process of changing; one end of the spectrum has featured the entrance of several new independent RTD players with roots in Mexico, while the other has seen The Coca-Cola Company revive a legacy aguas frescas brand to serve as the platform for building the category in foodservice outlets. With momentum building on both sides, could now be the time for aguas frescas to finally form a wave of their own?

While not as universally popular, aguas frescas, which translates to “cool waters,” are arguably as much ingrained into Mexican cultural identity as tequila. Typically either prepared at home or purchased fresh from street vendors, agua fresca is water and a sweetener (traditionally cane sugar) blended with fruits or botanicals. While a natural choice for refreshment during the hot summer months, the drinks also play an important role in the country’s food culture. Typical ingredients such as hibiscus (or ‘jamaica’), tamarind, guava and melon provide a light and refreshing taste to counterbalance the robust and spicy flavors in Mexican cuisine, making aguas frescas an ubiquitous presence in restaurants and on kitchen tables across the country.

Villán García, director of marketing for Los Angeles-based RTD aguas frescas brand Agua Lucha, recalled trips with his family to the local market in Mexico City, where families would dine on food from vendors on large common tables. His cousin Pedro, who now serves as Agua Lucha’s COO, often went as well.

“In these dining areas, on the one hand you had all the people who made the food, and on the other hand you have all the people who make the aguas,” he said. “When you sit down and eat, you eat terrific food, and then the juice people would come. They would have at least 8 to 12 different ones, and each was different. It was just as important what you were eating as what you were drinking.”

David Zapata, founder and CEO of New York-based startup Mex2o, grew up in Mexico drinking aguas frescas from the local market before emigrating to the United States at age 10.

“What I remember is that the drinks we would have were very light and always fresh,” he said, noting the contrast to Mexican sodas, such as the popular Jarritos brand. “It is something you can have and not feel heavy afterwards; just drink it and keep going.”

Together, Agua Lucha and Mex2o represent the latest brands to attempt to build a viable RTD aguas frescas category at U.S. retail. And if there was ever an opportune time for that to happen, sales data suggests it is now. According to market research group SPINS, non-carbonated flavored water is growing at 20 percent year-over-year, making it the fastest growing category (along with sparkling flavored water) in the $13 billion shelf-stable water market. Sales of flavored still water products are up double-digits across all retail channels, with the conventional multi-outlet stores growing at nearly 20 percent year-over-year. Within the market, according to Nielsen data, products from The Coca-Cola Company (Glaceau Vitaminwater) and PepsiCo (Propel) dominate, while rising independent brands such as Hint and Good 2 Grow have made inroads.

Despite the momentum behind flavored still waters, aguas frescas have had uneven results; in 2014, Califia Farms introduced a three-SKU line in 48 oz. multi serve bottles, which was pulled from production in 2017, while in 2011 Nestle USA launched a single-serve product in select markets that has also since been discontinued. Santa Cruz Organic currently sells aguas frescas in four flavors in 32 oz. glass bottles, and Frey Farms launched a line of frozen juice drink mixes labeled as “aguas frescas” late last year.

The reasons why some aguas frescas products have been more successful than others are varied, but both Zapata and García agree that previous iterations have struggled with authenticity, in terms of both formulation and branding.

For Agua Lucha, which translates literally to “fight water,” the Garcías are aiming to capture Mexico’s charm and unique personality right on the package. The product is sweetened with sugar, agave, and stevia, is available in three flavors — Mandarina, Limon and Tamarindo — in 15.2 oz. PET bottles. In a nod to their great uncle, who wrestled alongside legendary masked Mexican luchador El Santo, the bottles are stylized in the aesthetic of a wrestling match flyer, with bold typography and a different mask on each SKU. The brand’s messaging also spins the cultural quirks into humor, with phrases like “Jamaica is Not a Country, It’s a Flavor” and “Quieres Ser Chingon?” (“do you want to be cool?”).

“I really think where people have fallen short is in delivering that authentic message and that story behind it,” said García. “On top of having strong cultural roots, we also have a strong respect for what we grew up eating and drinking. I think we do a great job of relaying that message through our brand, and that’s the disconnect that I see from others.”

In designing Mex2o, Zapata is aiming to give the traditional Mexican drink a modern edge by adding functional ingredients like prebiotics, B-vitamins and fiber. Mex2o is packaged in 16 oz. PET bottles and is available in four flavors — Tamarindo, Jamaica, Horchata and Pipino Limon. Each SKU contains 12 g of sugar and 70 calories per bottle, and is sweetened with agave nectar and stevia.

“At the end of the day, I don’t want to say that (other brands) are doing it the ‘wrong way,’” he said. “There’s probably a market for them. What I’m saying is that what we are doing, no other company is doing right now. Not only does it have a more traditional feel, but we are also thinking of how we can make this a healthier product, by having low sugar, plus fiber and vitamins.”

When the world’s biggest beverage company decides to dive into a new category, it means something. In the two years since The Coca-Cola Company announced the launch of Barrilitos, a line of fountain service aguas frescas designed exclusively for food service retail, the results indicate that the move has begun to pay off.

According to Miranda Pritchett, senior manager for category strategy and innovation at Coca-Cola North America (CCNA), Barrilitos is currently available in approximately 2,700 foodservice on-premise locations and has seen its year-over-year sales grow 256 percent. The product, which contains 3 to 5 percent juice, comes in two forms: a bag-in-box mix for fountain dispensers and a frozen concentrate for use with a proprietary bubbler, the latter of which Pritchett credited as a distinctive asset for the brand.

“The fact that Barrilitos can be served from a proprietary bubbler also differentiates the product in the marketplace in general, as the equipment has an authentic feel and communicates freshly prepared ingredients and handcrafted products,” she said. “The transparency of the bubbler helps position Barrilitos as the fresh, artisan-inspired, craft beverage option that today’s consumers are seeking.”

While the fountain product has only been on the market for about 22 months, Barrilitos brings some authenticity to Coke’s venture as well; the brand first launched as a sparkling soda in Mexico in 1938 before it was acquired by the Atlanta-based beverage giant in 2008. Pritchett said CCNA has drawn on that awareness thus far by focusing on the West Coast and specifically Mexican restaurants and convenience stores, as it seeks to cultivate both Latino consumers and millennial foodies.

“Our goal for Barrilitos is to have the brand be more mainstream and not targeted at one demographic group,” she wrote. “In other words, we aim to appeal to people who are looking for new beverages in the mid/low calorie range and that are bold in flavor.”

Beyond flavor, however, Barrilitos brings the powerful backing of CCNA’s marketing and distribution capabilities; because of this, according to Pritchett, the brand “has the potential to become the first national aguas frescas brand.” The next step is for Barrilitos to move into the central and eastern parts of the U.S., as well as introduce new innovations such as a frozen Strawberry Hibiscus slushie this summer. Though an RTD line is not in the works, Pritchett wrote, “We’re always exploring options to grow and give people the drink they want in the most convenient ways possible.”

As they seek to go deeper into the U.S. market, both Mex2o and Agua Lucha are taking different tactical approaches to achieve a similar goal: establish credibility with Latin consumers before taking their respective brands mainstream.

To begin building their brand, the Garcías looked to develop the connection between aguas frescas and Mexican cuisine. While Pedro said the company is “being careful with what we share” regarding its strategy, he noted that Agua Lucha started selling first to taco trucks in the Los Angeles area.

“There so much attention to chefs and to the strength of Mexican food culture right now,” he said, adding that the buying power of the city’s large Latino population is also growing. “We are talking about the whole experience, including food and pairings. A lot of people want to grab our culture but they didn’t grow up drinking this since they were young and knowing the differences and how the [aguas] pair with food. That’s where we are having a lot of resonance with the chef because they say, ‘This is the real deal.’”

Agua Lucha has leveraged that early success with taco trucks and Mexican restaurants to move into the broader food service channel, which represents the majority of its 120 current clients. Vilian said the brand intends to continue to develop mainly in food service as it grows, but also with a limited presence at independent grocers, c-stores and liquor stores. The next step for Agua Lucha is to make the jump from one food-loving audience to another — millennials, of course — through sampling and targeted activations, as the brand did with staff and security at Coachella last year.

“Millennials are very food-centric — we care about what we eat and where it comes from and that plays to our advantage in that sense,” he said.

On the East Coast, Mex2o has teamed with Brooklyn-based Master Beverages to begin seeding the brand in select stores in predominantly Latino neighborhoods in New York City, while also selling the product direct to consumers through its website. Zapata said that while Hispanic consumers will likely already be familiar with the brand’s proposition, Mex2o will aim to capture mainstream customers who may have heard of aguas frescas or its flavors but haven’t been presented with them in an approachable, ready-to-drink format and at a competitive price.

“We are going to position ourselves like the Vitaminwater of the ethnic beverage market,” said Aleks Veyg, the co-founder of Mex2o’s Brooklyn-based distributor Master Beverages. Vegs, who also helped Zapata develop the formulation and branding for Mex2o, said the combination of flavor and functionality will help extend the brand’s customer base.

“In terms of formulation, you can add ingredients in there that will improve the buying capabilities and attraction of the product besides just the fact that it is Latin American themed,” he said. “By adding the nutritional/functional value, taken it from only those consumers to something that is more broad and that more people interested in purchasing.”

Ironically, one place you may not find either Mex2o or Agua Lucha is in Mexico; according to García, RTD aguas frescas aren’t very prevalent or popular in the country because most people prefer to purchase it fresh or prepare it at home themselves. However, even in a crowded U.S. market for flavored waters, he’s confident that the unique qualities of aguas frescas — and the passion of those who make them — won’t be lost in translation.

“This isn’t some MBA who came up with this,” he said. “This comes from who we are.”",Cool Factor: Can Aguas Frescas Seize Their Moment?

"— The Maple Guild, the world’s largest single-source producer of organic Tree-To-Table maple-based food and beverage products, will introduce a line of three probiotic beverages at Natural Products Expo West in Anaheim, CA, from March 6-8, 2019.",2019-02-22,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/21173051/296916460.tmg-probiotic-bevs-480x307.png,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/the-maple-guild-to-preview-probiotic-beverages-at-expo-west,"ISLAND POND, Vt.— The Maple Guild, the world’s largest single-source producer of organic Tree-To-Table maple-based food and beverage products, will introduce a line of three probiotic beverages at Natural Products Expo West in Anaheim, CA, from March 6-8, 2019.

The Maple Guild’s gut-healthy beverages are anticipated at retailers in select markets, as well as the brand’s direct-to-consumer online shop, this summer.

The company – steward of a 16,000-acre sugar maple forest and production facility in northern Vermont – has been re-imagining maple since the brand entered the market in 2016 with its award-winning Steam-crafted syrups. This state-of-the-art process, which put The Maple Guild on the foodie map, involves indirectly heating maple sap tapped from its own trees via steam instead of direct heat. The result is a smoother, more delicate flavor when compared to the burnt, caramelized taste of typical syrup. In the past two years, The Maple Guild has added a maple spread, vinegar, teas and enhanced waters to its expanding portfolio.

The brand’s pioneering ethos continues with its functional beverage line, blending New England tradition and innovation, resulting in a trifecta of 16-oz. fermented elixirs:

In the 17th century, switchels became a popular drink for farmers at hay-harvest time in the American colonies. Starting with ice-cold well water and vinegar, the drink (sometimes called a haymaker) was finished with molasses or maple syrup. The Maple Guild enters this recently rediscovered beverage category with its Mixed Berry Switchel, using its own Maple Vinegar instead of harsh apple cider vinegar. The Maple Guild’s Maple Vinegar starts with maple sap naturally aged in California wine barrels. Organic summer berries from the Northeast add new flavor to this effervescent beverage of true American heritage.

With 19th century roots in Russia, Kefir is traditionally a dairy-based drink using sugar for fermentation. The Maple Guild’s Blueberry Kefir, instead, is fruit-based and dairy-free, using the brand’s Steam Crafted Grade A Maple Syrup in place of sugar. This results in a beverage with a lower-glycemic index and packed with antioxidants, b-vitamins, minerals and flavonoids from tapt. Blueberry, one of The Maple Guild’s own maple-sweetened, enhanced waters.

Kombucha, the ever-popular fermented tea drink of Chinese origins dating back centuries, is typically made using generous amounts of refined white table sugar for fermentation. Instead of sugar, The Maple Guild ferments organic, non-GMO, fair-trade green tea from India with its own Steam-Crafted Grade A Maple Syrup. This delivers a more subtle taste, lower glycemic index and increased nutrients.

At Natural Products Expo West, the brand will sample, for the first time, its new probiotic drinks as well as its core line of six syrups and three new syrup infusions: Orange Cardamom, Coffee and Mixed Berry. The brand will also showcase its previously-launched specialty items like its Maple Vinegar, Maple Butter and its maple-sweetened teas and enhanced tapt. waters.

The Maple Guild – steward of the world’s largest “sugar bush” or sugar maple forest – has been rapidly expanding product offerings and retail distribution since it began tapping its trees in Vermont’s storied Northeast Kingdom just four years ago. In the past year, it doubled production while reducing its carbon footprint, due in part to its energy-efficient Steam- Crafted process and a newly-installed dual evaporation system.

Its food and beverage offerings are available at retailers like Whole Foods, Sprouts, Wegman’s, Albertsons, H-E-B, Giant, Hannaford, Stop & Shop and Safeway. The Maple Guild’s supply chain has national and regional retail distributors including United Natural Foods, Inc. and KeHE Distributors, LLC.

The Maple Guild, which launched in 2016, has become the largest single-source producer of organic maple syrup in the world. Its mission: to produce the purest, highest-quality maple syrup and maple-based products on the market by managing every part of the process from Tree-To-Table. Overseeing 16,000 acres of sugar bush in northern Vermont – with an 1,800-mile network of tap lines – The Maple Guild produces its syrup through a reverse-osmosis and Steam-Crafted process. This allows The Maple Guild to go from sap to syrup in less than 90 seconds, resulting in a smaller carbon footprint by volume than its competitors, less processing, higher yields and a purer maple-flavor profile.

"Sunny Delight Beverages Co. was awarded $88,383 for legal fees after winning a class action lawsuit that claimed that labelling for the brand’s fruit-flavored drinks did not clearly indicate the products were artificially flavored.",2019-02-22,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/22172226/SunnyD_Full-Width_1.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/in-the-courtroom-sunny-delight-wins-lawsuit,"Sunny Delight Beverages Co. was awarded $88,383 for legal fees after winning a class action lawsuit that claimed that labelling for the brand’s fruit-flavored drinks did not clearly indicate the products were artificially flavored.

The lawsuit, Michelle Hunt et al. v. Sunny Delight Beverages Co. et al., filed last April in the United States District Court Central District of California, specifically cited the company’s SunnyD Orange Strawberry and Orange Pineapple flavors for using images of fresh fruit on its labels but failing to disclose that the drinks were made with artificial flavors and other ingredients.

In her ruling, judge Josephine Staton enumerated multiple inaccuracies in Hunt’s accusations against Sunny Delight. The original complaint featured mockup images made by the company of its multi-serve products without disclaimer text on the labels, which according to the company were intended only for online marketing purposes and did not represent the actual product on shelf.

Sunny Delight was represented by law firm Braunhagey & Borden, which specializes in class action defense for corporations. Speaking with BevNET today, partner and co-founder Matthew Borden said that due to the mistakes in the complaint the case was fairly easy to argue.

“What I did was I brought an actual bottle of it into court and I showed the judge,” Borden told BevNET. “I said ‘I just bought this last night after I got off the airplane. Here’s the actual label, there’s no way these people were deceived.’”

According to Borden, the plaintiffs refiled their complaint after the initial complaint was struck, but it once again included misleading photos of the bottles.

“I’m a person who takes what I eat and drink seriously, and I think we should have accurate labels, but none of these cases are really about the labelling,” Borden said of the suit and similar class action cases. “It’s just about some kind of ‘gotcha’ to make a company pay money.”

Vital Pharmaceuticals, maker of energy drink VPX Bang, has been named in a new class action lawsuit taking aim at functional claims made by the company and its slogan promising consumers “brain & body rocking fuel.”

A suit filed this month in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida calls into question the “body rocking” slogan, arguing the company “misrepresents the ingredients of BANG, luring consumers into purchasing the product that fails to deliver the promised benefits,” according to a posting on Top Class Actions. The suit, Nguyen et al. v. Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc., alleges the drink “does not contain” key ingredients including creatine, coenzyme Q10, and branched chain amino acids, or that “the amounts contained … are minimal.”

“Defendant knows that consumers are willing to pay more for sports and energy products that contain ‘SUPER’ Creatine, ‘ULTRA’ CoQ10, and Branched Chain Amino Acids, as opposed to those that do not, in part because the listed ingredients are valuable and desired for these consumers, the quality is higher, and consumers believe they are paying costs associated with higher quality ‘potent,’ ‘SUPER,’ and ‘ULTRA’ ingredients,” the suit alleges.

Kids beverage maker Capri Sun GmbH is suing its former manufacturer American Beverage Corporation (ABC) for breach of contract, alleging the company has continued to sell Capri Sun’s patented, trademark-protected pouch packaging after an agreement between the two companies expired last year.

In a partially redacted complaint filed this month in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Capri Sun alleges that ABC produced lines of fruit-flavored kids drinks under multiple brand names — including SunnyD, Juicy Juice, Nature’s Nectar, Wild Harvest, and Oh-So Organic — using its pouch package, resulting in $75,000 in damages. This continued, according to the complaint, despite “multiple protest letters” sent by Capri Sun to ABC beginning in August 2018.

“Consumers throughout the world associate the iconic CAPRI SUN pouch trademark uniquely with Capri Sun, and we do not want our loyal customers to be confused or deceived about the source or quality of products that ABC is offering under its imitation, knock-off pouch,” said Kathrin Stapper, chief legal counsel for Capri Sun, in a press release.

According to the complaint, Capri Sun is seeking ABC immediately stop producing pouch-packaged products, destroy its existing inventory, and pay all profits made on the products to Capri Sun.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont announced this week a new budget agenda which includes a proposal for a 1.5 cents per ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, according to The Hill.

The tax is estimated to raise about $163 million in new revenue for the next fiscal year. However, the move is likely to ignite a political battle in Connecticut similar to those seen in California and other states and municipalities that have attempted to pass soda taxes.

“Similar taxes on sugary drinks in Philadelphia, Boulder and Seattle have failed to raise significant revenue and have hurt local business,” Boylan Bottling Co. COO and Connecticut resident Chris Taylor told The Hill. “It’s troubling that our governor and the Democrats in Hartford are willing to target one specific line of business rather than focusing on renegotiating bad deals with in-state unions.”

Also this week, The San Francisco Chronicle reported that Democrats in the California legislature, which under pressure from soda producers voted last year to ban cities from passing new soda taxes, are now looking at a number of new regulations against sugar-sweetened beverages.

The new bills under review include a ban on the sale of “Big Gulp”-style sodas by limiting cup sizes to 16 oz, placing health warning labels on sugar-sweetened beverages, a ban on grocery stores displaying such drinks at checkout, banning in-store promotions on soda, and a new tax on sugary drinks which would fund programs which “offset their health effects,” according to The Chronicle.

“We have an incredible public health crisis. Obesity and diabetes are at alarming rates, driven by the deception of Big Soda,” Assemblyman David Chiu, D-San Francisco, told The Chronicle. “And certainly what happened last year didn’t help.”",In the Courtroom: Sunny Delight Wins Lawsuit

Yet while some companies are racing to expand and innovate, Blue Bottle, one of the most admired coffee roasters and retailers in the world, is taking a patient and restrained approach.

“Our way is not the right way if we want to be the most commercially successful company in the country. Meehan said in an interview included in this episode. “There are companies ahead of us that are doing more innovation. But I think our way is the right way if we think about the long-term value of the brand and what taste we deliver to our customers.”

That perspective is embraced by Blue Bottle’s majority owner, Nestlé, which in September 2017 paid approximately $500 million for a 68 percent stake in the company. Meehan remarked that Nestlé views Blue Bottle as “doing something very unique and should not be touched.”

“Throughout the whole culture of Nestlé, there’s support to just (let) Blue Bottle be,” he said.

As part of our conversation, we spoke with Meehan about how Blue Bottle’s new line of whole bean coffee in pressure-sealed cans fits into its purposeful innovation strategy.

Last year, PureCircle announced that it vastly increased its capacity to supply the new generation stevia sweeteners like Reb M to its customers cost effectively for them. Now, the company — the leading producer and innovator of stevia sweeteners — has expanded its commercial teams to broaden its sales reach and maintain its superior customer sales and technical service.

As part of that expansion, the Company has hired three new vice presidents:

Aymeric De Gantes will serve as VP of business development. He will be focused on expanding the sales of stevia ingredient flavors. He recently served in multiple roles for Naturex Inc., a leading plant-based ingredients company, including as a global director and as a sales and business development director.

Catalina Reachi Simon will serve as regional VP of North Latin America sales. She is experienced in leading business teams and most recently served as the General Manager for Mexico, Central America and Colombia at Roha Sciences, which produces and sells ingredients to the food, beverage, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics industries.

Chris Tower will serve as the company’s regional VP of North American sales. He has strong experience and expertise in the ingredient business; he was formerly founding president and CEO of Layn USA, Inc. a leading natural ingredient supplier of sweeteners, flavors and botanicals.

These new leaders report to Chief Commercial Officer Stéphane Ducroux who joined the company in 2018.

In addition to these three new vice presidents, the company has added other members to its global and regional teams, the cost of which will be offset by internal efficiency savings.

The company has also promoted Dave Gallagher and Ken Horn to VPs of Global Key Accounts. Gallagher and Horn oversee sales to some of the company’s most important global customers and are experts in the company’s products and their applications.

Commenting on these changes, PureCircle CEO Maga Malsagov said: “These moves will enable us to even better capitalize on the growth opportunities created by our innovation and by the increasing demand for new generation stevia ingredients. As the global leader in stevia, we are able to attract top talent to help fuel our growth, and we welcome the new hires to the PureCircle team.”

By way of background, the story of stevia is evolving. Not long ago, it was viewed as a plant-based, zero-calorie, single-ingredient sweetener which worked well in some beverage and food applications. Today we offer a range of next generation stevia leaf sweeteners, including Reb M and D, which taste great and work well across multiple categories. These sweeteners help beverage and food companies increase their offerings of zero- and low-calories products without sacrificing taste.

Recent PureCircle advances enable the company to significantly boost production of our next generation stevia sweeteners – like Reb M and Reb D — which have the most sugar-like taste and are highly sought after by beverage and food companies. This means PureCircle is able to supply stevia sweeteners in the amounts customers need as they expand use of stevia – and is able to do that cost effectively for them.

In addition, as the result of its innovation, PureCircle is expanding its offerings and will sell, not just stevia sweeteners, but also protein, fiber and antioxidant ingredients from the stevia plant.

PureCircle is the only company that combines advanced R&D with full vertical integration from farm to high-quality, great-tasting innovative stevia sweeteners. The company collaborates with farmers who grow the stevia plants and with food and beverage companies which seek to improve their low- and no-calorie formulations using a sweetener from plants. PureCircle will continue to: lead in research, development and innovation; produce a growing supply of multiple varieties of stevia sweeteners with sugar-like taste, using all necessary and appropriate methods of production; and be a resource and innovation partner for food and beverage companies. PureCircle stevia flavor modifiers work in synergy with sweeteners to improve the taste, mouthfeel and calorie profile and enhance the cost effectiveness of beverage and food products. Founded in 2002, PureCircle is continually investing in breakthrough research and development and it has been granted over 130 stevia-related patents with more than 250 applied for patents pending. PureCircle has offices around the world with the global headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. To meet growing demand for stevia sweeteners, PureCircle is rapidly ramping up its supply capability. It completed expansion of its Malaysian stevia extract facility in March 2017, increasing its capacity to rapidly supply the newer and great-tasting specialty stevia sweeteners and helping provide ever-increasing value to its customers. PureCircle’s shares are listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. For more information, visit: purecircle.com

Given the growing global concerns about obesity and diabetes, beverage and food companies are working responsibly to reduce sugar and calories in their products, responding to both consumers and health and wellness advocates. Sweeteners from the stevia plant offer sugar-like taste and are becoming an increasingly important tool for these companies. Like sugar, stevia sweeteners are from plants. But unlike sugar, they enable low-calorie and zero-calorie formulations of beverages and foods. Stevia leaf extract is a natural-based, zero calorie, high-intensity sweetener, used by global food and beverage companies as a great-tasting zero-calorie alternative to sugar and artificial sweeteners. Stevia is a naturally sweet plant native to South America; today, it is grown around the world, notably in Kenya, China and the US. The sweet-tasting parts of the stevia leaf are up to 350 times sweeter than sugar: stevia’s high-intensity sweetness means it requires far less water and land than sugar. Research has shown that the molecules of the stevia leaf are present and unchanged in the dried stevia leaf, through the commercial extraction and purification process, and in the final stevia leaf extract product. All major global regulatory organizations, across 65 countries, have approved the use of high-purity stevia leaf extracts in food and beverages.

Founder Jon Sebastiani told NOSH the additions are reflective of how the firm has evolved since its inception, adding both to its portfolio of investments and owned properties: marshmallow brand Smashmallow, egg brand Peckish and drinkable chilled soup brand Zupa Noma.",,https://d2azl42aua8mom.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/12183450/Sonoma_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.nosh.com/news/2019/sonoma-brands-sees-management-additions,"Over the past two months, investment group and incubator Sonoma Brands has seen changes to its operating team including the addition of two managing directors. Founder Jon Sebastiani told NOSH the additions are reflective of how the firm has evolved since its inception, adding both to its portfolio of investments and owned properties: marshmallow brand Smashmallow, egg brand Peckish and drinkable chilled soup brand Zupa Noma.

Recently, Kevin Murphy joined the firm as a managing director. Murphy spent 13 years at Encore Capital, as one of the earliest employees of the firm. Murphy, a friend of Sebastiani’s since his Krave days, told NOSH that after departing Encore last summer, he was drawn to the operator-focused investment thesis that Sonoma offered brands.

“I saw true investment capability with a building track record, but coming from different perspectives than what we normally see with a traditionally structured investment firm,” Murphy said.

Joining Murphy as managing director is Brian Nicholson, who joined Sonoma as a principle in January 2018. Nicholson brought with him a focus on ecommerce, digital media and direct-to-consumer businesses, having spent five years with Stripes Group, leading the firm’s investments in Refinery29, Reformation and The Black Tux.

Those digital skills will benefit not only Sonoma’s investments, which include direct-to-consumer kids meal plan Yumble, but also Sonoma’s own brands. Zupa Noma, for example, went from being sold in brick and mortar stores to an ecommerce focus. Sebastiani cited a struggle to connect and educate consumers on retail shelves as the cause for the change.

Peckish has also focused on digital, as it has taken a more measured approach to its launch. The brand first entered California’s Erewhon in January before rolling out in Equinox locations in the Northeast, Whole Foods’ 365 stores and direct-to-consumer via its website.

“With Peckish we’re building a different value proposition, so [we’re going] much slower,” Sebastiani said. “Peckish was a brand that we’re going to slowly bleed out into the marketplace into very influential accounts.”

Peckish’s rollout comes as the brand has also undergone staffing changes. In December, Peckish CEO and Sonoma Brands Chief Brand officer Chelsea Bialla departed the company. Sebastiani told NOSH that Bialla had departed for “personal reasons” but her “fingerprints are all over our brands.” To fill the vacancy, Lauren Egan has been promoted to VP of Brand and the Sonoma Brands team is assisting with operations and the day-to-day management of the business. It’s a testament, Sebastiani said, to the Sonoma team.

“Having a tremendously complimentary, collaborative group of people that are accretive in their backgrounds and talents to each other is just sensationally important,” Sebastiani said.",Sonoma Brands Sees Management Additions

The new product line, a collaborative effort with Worcester, Massachusetts’ Polar Beverages, is called Arctic Summer.

Starting in late April, Harpoon will begin shipping four flavors – Ruby Red Grapefruit, Pineapple Pomelo, Raspberry Lime, and Black Cherry – to its Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic markets, according to brewery co-founder and CEO Dan Kenary.

Speaking to Brewbound, Kenary said the new venture marks the first time a beer company has teamed up with a non-alcoholic beverage company that specializes in manufacturing sparkling water for the creation of spiked offerings.

“We had an opportunity to work with the leading seltzer brand in our market,” he said. “We are using their flavors in these seltzers, and they will be more highly carbonated – something that Polar is known for.”

Made with 100 percent cane sugar, the four flavors – which will be sold in 6-packs and variety 12-packs — will check in at 5 percent ABV. Flavored with “the same essences that Polar uses in its non-alcoholic products,” they will contain 110 calories and just 1 gram of sugar, Kenary said.

The base liquid will be produced at Harpoon’s facility in Boston, and then transported to Polar’s facility in Worcester, where it will be carbonated and flavored, he added.

“I think the world of the Crowley family and the way they run their business,” Kenary, who is originally from Worcester, said of Polar’s ownership. “We were honored that they wanted to do this with us.”

The introduction of the new Arctic Summer line marks the second time that Harpoon has partnered with Polar. Last May, the two companies collaborated on a UFO wheat beer “brewed with the essence of Polar Seltzer’ade Blueberry Lemonade.”

But even as that project came to life, Kenary said the hard seltzer category still wasn’t something Harpoon was interested in expanding into.

“We are beer people to our bones,” he said. “But we started paying closer attention to the space about two years ago when all of a sudden our kids and friends were talking about hard seltzer and bringing it to parties.”

Kenary said Harpoon, which worried about brand loyalty within the segment, would not have entered the hard seltzer market without its partnership with Polar, which grew sales of its non-alcoholic seltzers 15.6 percent last year, according to market research firm IRI.

“There is an opportunity for branding, and it is going to be about flavor and story,” he said. “We believe people will give it a shot because they really like Polar, and that is what will allow us to be successful.”

Nevertheless, Harpoon is jumping into an already crowded hard seltzer space at a time when numerous craft breweries have recently rolled out products aimed at competing with dominate brands made by major players.

In recent months, companies such as Oskar Blues (Wild Basin Boozy Sparkling Water), Braxton Brewing (Vive Hard Seltzer), Perrin Brewing (Clear Coast Fresh Hard Seltzer) NoDa Brewing (Brizo Hard Seltzer), Perrin Brewing (Clear Coast Hard Seltzer) and Platform Beer Company have all entered the fray.

Their goal? To grab a piece of a $520 million hard seltzer segment, which grew 175 percent over the last 52 weeks, according to Nielsen.

Category leader Mark Anthony Brands sold nearly $195 million worth of its White Claw Hard Seltzer offerings at off-premise retailers last year, as the company grew its portfolio-wide depletions 29 percent.

Boston Beer Company’s recently rebranded Truly Hard Seltzer (originally called Truly Spiked & Sparkling) is the next largest brand in the segment, with sales of its variety pack offering alone eclipsing $59 million in 2018.

Meanwhile, nearly a dozen other companies are currently making or have announced plans to introduce hard seltzer and other “spiked” products, including Wachusett Brewing (Nauti Seltzer), Two Beers Brewing (Sound Hard Seltzer), M.I.A Beer Company (HRD WTR), 3 Daughters Brewing (Florida Hard Seltzers), 2 Towns Ciderhouse (SeekOut Real Hard Seltzer) Briggs Hard Seltzer, Press Hard Seltzer, and Crook & Marker spiked and sparkling beverages. Utah’s Squatters Craft Beers, which is part of the Canarchy Craft Brewery Collective that also owns Oskar Blues and Perrin Brewing, is also developing a hard seltzer brand called Grandeur Peak.

For his part, Kenary said the introduction of Arctic Summer, which will be sold year-round, is the “largest launch” Harpoon has ever planned.

“We have the Polar team fired up,” he said. “They have incredible relationships with chains, and we think we can become a player in our market with a hard seltzer this summer.”",Harpoon to Partner with Polar on Forthcoming Hard Seltzer Line

As the maker of simple, nutritious and incredibly delicious plant-based milks, Elmhurst 1925 will be the exclusive oat milk supplier for the Australian-inspired hospitality and lifestyle brand both in the new ready-to-drink coffee line and in stores nationwide. Elmhurst and Bluestone Lane will be showcasing the new line at 2019 Natural Products Expo West at Elmhurst’s booth #849; attendees are invited to stop-by to learn more and to taste the new coffee drink.

“Our partnership with Bluestone Lane further extends our mission to provide consumers with simple and nutritious plant-based beverages,” said Peter Truby, VP of marketing at Elmhurst. “With convenience, flavor and nutrition in mind, Bluestone Lane Cold-Pressed Coffee with Oat Milk makes healthy coffee beverages available to everyone on-the-go. Being a premium brand ourselves, we’re excited to support Bluestone Lane’s commitment to premium products and ingredients with this new line and as the exclusive oat and almond milk in its cafés.”

Crafted with Elmhurst 1925 Milked Oats and Bluestone Lane premium cold-pressed coffee, Cold-Pressed Coffee with Oat Milk offers a better-for-you alternative to traditional ready-to-drink coffee beverages. The cold-pressed coffee extracts a bold, concentrated taste that blends perfectly with the nutritious oat milk. Packed with flavor but low in sugar, the Australian-style coffee is dairy-free, gluten-free and non-GMO. Created with the millennial consumer in mind, this minimalist drink is resealable and shelf-stable, and complements both Elmhurst and Bluestone Lane’s commitment to clean product labels.

“We’re thrilled to partner with Elmhurst 1925 to introduce a ready-to-drink coffee beverage that is unparalleled in quality, taste and sustainability,” said Nicholas Stone, founder and CEO of Bluestone Lane. “Our Cold-Pressed Coffee with Oat Milk is perfect for consumers searching for a ready-to-drink coffee with the delicious taste of premium oat milk.”

Like all Elmhurst products, Milked Oats is crafted through a unique HydroRelease method. Using just water, HydroRelease separates the components of a nut, grain or seed, before reassembling them as a creamy, beverage-ready emulsion. The original ingredient’s nutrition is maintained, and no added gums or emulsifiers are needed to hold the product together. As with all Elmhurst plant milks, Milked Oats does not contain carrageenan, gums, oils or other emulsifiers.

Bluestone Lane’s Cold-Pressed Coffee with Oat Milk will be available in its cafés and at retail partners nationwide, as well as online later this year. It will be one of four new Cold-Pressed Coffee beverages that Bluestone Lane will release throughout the year.

Elmhurst 1925 makes simple, nutritious and incredibly delicious plant-based nut and grain milks. Elmhurst was founded in 2017, but the company’s roots date back to 1925. Originally Elmhurst Dairy, the multigenerational, family-run organization operated for almost a century under Max Schwartz and son Henry. After a meeting with plant nutrition pioneer, Dr. Cheryl Mitchell, Henry made a progressive pivot and decided to close his famous dairy plant and found Elmhurst Milked. All Elmhurst plant milks are created through a unique HydroRelease method, which uses water to harnesses the full nutritional content of raw grains, nuts or seeds. Nutrients are separated and recombined naturally to form a smooth, creamy beverage without the use of added gums or stabilizers. All Elmhurst varieties are made with six ingredients or less and no added gums or emulsifiers. Its nut milks have up to four times as many nuts as other leading brands, and its Peanut Protein Shakes contain 20 g protein per 12 oz. carton.

The funds will go toward launching a new supplier arm for the company to sell moringa as an ingredient to other food and beverage makers.

Jim Thorne, SVP of global strategy and marketing at Griffith Foods, will join Kuli Kuli’s board of directors. Other investors in the Series B include InvestEco, S2G Ventures, Authentic Ventures, VilCap Investments, Rocana Venture Partners, Portfolia, Astia Angels, Next Wave Impact, and individuals from Golden Seeds.

Speaking with BevNET, Kuli Kuli founder and CEO Lisa Curtis said when the company launched in 2011 there were no established sources for moringa in the U.S. that weren’t contaminated with heavy metals or bacteria. In response, Kuli Kuli developed its own sustainable supply chain of farmers to provide clean ingredients. Since establishing its own network, Curtis said the company has had to repeatedly turn away other food and beverage companies hoping to purchase moringa for their own products.

Since closing a $4.25 million Series A round in 2017, Curtis said the company has tripled in size and has quadrupled its supply chain to work with about 1,300 farmers globally, making the company large enough to accept orders from other brands. This strategic position, Curtis said, is what drew the interest of Griffith Foods, which will work with Kuli Kuli to develop a network of business-to-business customers for moringa as a commodity ingredient. Griffith largely services foodservice customers, processors, retailers and distributors.

“We spent the first four years of our company history struggling to get enough moringa just to supply ourselves,” Curtis told BevNET. “We’re finally at a point where we’ve expanded our supply chain, we’ve invested a ton in helping these small farming groups that we work with scale, and we have more moringa than we need than for just Kuli Kuli. We think we can create a bigger impact and better tell the story of moringa if we partner with other brands.”

The brand’s portfolio includes moringa powders, smoothie mixes, energy bars, bagged teas, and shots. Curtis compared moringa to the rise of other on-trend ingredients like matcha and turmeric. Data from Nielsen shows moringa currently has 3 percent household penetration in the U.S. According to the NEXT Trend database, moringa sales grew 460 percent between 2014 and 2017. Curtis said Kuli Kuli controls more than half the market share for moringa in the U.S. retail market, and by working with other companies she hopes a wave of new innovations from other brands will grow the space.

“We’ve done a good job with telling the story, awareness has absolutely grown,” Curtis said. “But we need moringa to show up in other places within the grocery store and even outside the grocery store. We’re really looking closely at that, so can we get this on the menu at different juice bars? Can work with bakeries who are making matcha cookies but might want to make something with moringa. I think once consumers start to see something everywhere they start to understand what it is.”

The company will also launch a rebrand of its shots line at Natural Products Expo West 2019 next week. Its current line will be replaced with three new SKUs of “Energy PLUS+” 2.5 oz shots each featuring moringa and green tea blended with other functional ingredients.

Varieties include Daily Green Boost (green smoothie flavor with multigreens), Focus Focus Focus (raspberry acai flavor with lion’s mane), and Get Well Soon (citrus flavor with camu camu). Each flavor contains 90 mg of caffeine sourced from green tea. The shots will sell for a suggested retail price of $3.99. All products are non-GMO and USDA organic certified.

In addition to establishing a supplier arm, Kuli Kuli will continue to scale its own CPG business. The company currently has a retail footprint of about 7,000 stores nationwide. According to Curtis, Kuli Kuli is seeking to add new accounts but the company’s main goal is to go deeper and expand within existing accounts, many of which currently carry just a minimal number of SKUs.

“We really want to get the entire product line into retailers and tell the story of how all our moringa products can contribute to a healthy lifestyle,” Curtis said. “We’re excited to do that, but there’s still a ton of white space and a lot of accounts we know we would do well in but we aren’t in them yet. So we’re working on that front as well.”","Kuli Kuli Raises $5M, Will Launch Supplier Arm for Moringa"

She discovered the canned cold brew coffee while on tour, will help bring High Brew’s “For Those Who Do” message to a larger audience.

With her sky rocketing success, Halsey shows no signs of slowing down, so it was fortuitous she started using High Brew’s clean energy benefits to keep her caffeinated night after night on stage. The transition from High Brew “super fan” to investor was a natural one, as she looked to diversify her portfolio and put her name behind something she loved. Known for pushing creative boundaries, in addition to investing in the brand, Halsey will be involved in the innovation process and assisting High Brew with concepts for future clean energy formulas.

“I love High Brew because I have a super-fast lifestyle. It’s so easy to grab a can and go, whether it’s on a jet, backstage before a concert, on a long day of press interviews, or keeping me cheerful and energetic on a photoshoot,” said Halsey. “My favorite trick is mixing High Brew into a cocktail for those late-night industry parties where I have to be sharp and awake but want to have a little fun as well. It’s versatile for someone like me. I just love it.”

Halsey joins a slew of other celebrity investors including former MLB pitcher, Huston Street, pop rock group, Kings of Leon, Lance Armstrong and chef, Tim Love. The star power behind High Brew isn’t surprising considering the fact the brand was born “for those who do” when founder, David Smith, discovered the amazing functional and clean energy benefits of cold brew coffee during a sailing adventure with his family. High Brew packs two times the amount of caffeine as a regular cup of coffee and is made from the best direct-trade coffee beans all in a convenient, on-the-go can. With flavors including Black and Bold, Double Espresso, Mexican Vanilla, Salted Caramel, Dark Chocolate Mocha, and additional options like Creamy Cappuccino + Protein and new Milk Chocolate + Protein, Triple Shot (for a triple dose of caffeine), and new Sparkling, there is an option for just about any “doer” out there.

“When we first heard Halsey was a fan of the brand, we knew we had to find a way to work with her,” said David Smith, founder of High Brew Coffee. “Rolling Stone once described Halsey as bold and that’s exactly the quality we are looking for in an investor. As strong a woman, who pours her heart into all she does, Halsey is the perfect fit to help us convey our clean energy message as she continues to dominate the music industry.”

After working tirelessly for 13 years to turn his tiny tea company into a household name, David Smith, co-founder of Sweet Leaf Tea, embarked on the sailing adventure of a lifetime. Discovering the benefits of refreshing cold-brewed coffee during warm nights navigating rough waters, the idea for High Brew Coffee was born. Founded in 2014, High Brew is an all-natural 100 percent Arabica blend ready-to-drink cold brew coffee made from Direct Trade coffee beans. Brewed with zero heat, High Brew Coffee offers premium low-calorie cold-brews in smooth, delicious flavors such as Double Espresso, Mexican Vanilla, Salted Caramel, Dark Chocolate Mocha, Black & Bold and Creamy Cappuccino + Protein. The brand also recently launched three Sparkling Cold Brew Flavors in Classic Black, Vintage Vanilla and Midnight Mocha, as well as Milk Chocolate + Protein, with 3 grams of fiber and 12 grams of protein. High Brew Coffee is shelf stable to perfectly accompany an active and on-the-go lifestyle. For more information, please visit highbrewcoffee.com.

Grammy Award-nominated multi-platinum singer/songwriter Halsey claimed the number one spot on the Billboard Top 200 with her second release, hopeless fountain kingdom, an album Rolling Stone called “bold” in a 4-star review, claiming that “Halsey could go anywhere from here.” Indeed, since storming on the music scene in 2015, she has garnered over 7 billion stream globally and nearly 6 million global sales, graced the covers of magazines from Nylon to Billboard to Forbes, among others—a far cry from the New Jersey teen who’d escaped her suburban existence for New York, writing poetry, and scrounging money for concerts and her next slice of pizza.

Halsey shows no signs of slowing down. In the Fall of 2018 she released her two times platinum hit single, “Without Me,” which became her first solo song to reach number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. “Without Me” has more than 700 million combined streams and also reached number 1 on the iTunes charts. It came on the heels of the two time platinum-certified hit “Eastside,” with Benny Blanco and Khalid, which garnered 300 million streams worldwide in just 2 months. The track was the follow up to the 2x platinum-certified smash with G-Eazy “Him & I,” which reached #1 on Billboard’s Pop Songs Airplay Chart and #1 at Top 40 radio—marking her second #1 since accompanying The Chainsmokers’ on “Closer,” which dominated for 11 weeks and has been certified Diamond by the RIAA. “Him & I” has accrued over 750 million streams worldwide and been certified platinum in several countries. In addition, her own 3x platinum, “Bad At Love” and 2x platinum “Now Or Never” which also peaked in the top 3 at Top 40 radio.

In addition, Halsey pushes creative boundaries expanding her influence and impact beyond music. Halsey spoke at the 2018 women’s march advocating for equality. Her speech has been viewed millions of times and has moved people from around the world. As her star continues to rise, Halsey uses her voice to speak up for causes she passionately believes in, including disenfranchised youth, women’s rights, mental health and the LGBTQ community, proving that both she and her music can affect meaningful change, and that, yes, the 24-year-old can go anywhere from here.

Yves Saint Laurent recently tapped her as a brand ambassador of YSL Beauté where she will help create and share makeup looks that speak to today’s millennial. In 2018 she made her film debut in the animated summer movie “Teen Titans Go” as the voice of Wonder Woman, as well as in “A Star Is Born,” starring Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga.

Halsey went from putting songs on SoundCloud to having her first full length album, BADLANDS, land at number two on the Billboard Top 200 and become certified platinum by the RIAA within one year of its release, from couch surfing to witnessing her first tour sell out in minutes to touring globally with sold out dates on five continents (including a sold-out Madison Square Garden performance) and performing for the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Norway. In 2017 she earned a 2017 GRAMMY nomination in the category of “Best Pop Duo/Group Performance” for “Closer,” her Diamond Certified mega-hit with The Chainsmokers.",Pop Singer Halsey Invests In High Brew Coffee

Show-goers will be able to get a first look at Reed’s vibrant package redesign and get first-tastes of Reed’s new Zero Sugar craft ginger beer line, Reed’s Ready to Drink Mules, Reed’s Wellness Ginger Beers with Hemp Extract and Reed’s Daily Ginger Shots, all of which are packed with real, fresh ginger, known around the world for its health benefits and stimulating properties.

“Consumers are increasingly mindful about their beverage choices – they want better for you ingredients like the real ginger root that’s always been at the ‘root’ of Reed’s Ginger Beers, delivering great bold taste and the wellness benefits of ginger,” said Val Stalowir, CEO of Reed’s Inc. “From our classic ginger beer in three levels of ginger strength (Original, Extra and Strongest) to our newest introductions, including our zero sugar, zero calorie drinks, we’ve got something for all consumers to enjoy and help them add more healthy ginger into their lives.”

For centuries, ginger has been recognized as a powerful superfood with documented digestive, anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting benefits. For the past 30 years, it has been Reed’s mission to deliver great-tasting products with a simple formula that uses all-natural ingredients: fresh ginger root (and lots of it!), sparkling water, pineapple juice, lemon juice, honey, cane sugar and spices.

By contrast, recent reports have brought to light that most ginger ale sodas contain no significant amounts of real ginger. “Consumers who want real ginger, should reach past ginger ale and reach for Reed’s – it’s that simple,” said Stalowir. “We want to become the ginger beverage of choice for the next generation.”

With growing consumer interest for CBD/hemp extract food and beverage products, the Reed’s Wellness Ginger Beer is a powerful wellness drink that combines stimulating fresh ginger with broad spectrum hemp functionality. Available in Original and Zero Sugar 10 oz. slim cans, the products use proprietary Nano performance that allows for greater bioavailability, six times faster time-to-effect and six times more absorption than standard hemp extracts.

Reed’s new all-natural Ginger Shots are the fastest and easiest way for people to get their daily dose of great tasting, 2000mg of powerful fresh ginger and B Vitamins. Available in Original and Energy, the 2.5 oz. bottles are shelf stable and easy to enjoy on the go.

Virgil’s is America’s best-selling independent, full line of natural craft sodas. The Reed’s Inc. portfolio is sold in over 30,000 retail doors nationwide.

Backed by new retail partners such as 7/11, Urban Outfitters and Tao Group, Lee’s ambition is to scale More Labs into a biohacking beverage company that defies conventional product categories. More Labs has hired a chief scientist with former FDA experience and will be extending its innovation pipeline to areas like stress, focus, sleep and beyond.

“More Labs is about helping people combat modern-day stressors, enhancing their productivity and focusing on products that actually work to help people be at their best,” said Lee. “We listen closely to our customers, and challenge ourselves to build products that make a difference that people will feel.”

The launch of More Labs includes a reboot of its cult favorite Morning Recovery. It also introduces a sugar-free formula for the first time, due to popular customer demand. Both formulas feature a new look and significant upgrades, including patent-pending encapsulation technology for its hero liver-boosting ingredient DHM, as well as improved efficacy, taste and natural flavors. The new packaging is also a shift away from glass towards a custom plastic bottle, but preserves the signature gold cap and blue colors from Morning Recovery’s viral Indiegogo campaign in July 2017. With this launch, More Labs is the first company in the food space to use an bio-based plastic bottle with an aluminum cap.

With an upcoming debut of an entirely new beverage later this year and an expanded retail team, More Labs is moving quickly to respond to customer demand for products that work and fit seamlessly into their lifestyles.
• First to use aluminum cap with plastic bottle
• More than two million bottles of Morning Recovery sold worldwide with over 130,000 customers
• Donated $230,000 to fund research at USC School of Pharmacy

The product utilizes a freeze-dried technique to protect the cellular structure of the food, allowing it to maintain its original flavor and nutritional value. Mele is disrupting the category by pairing a delicious taste with a clean label including non-GMO, soy-free and preservative-free ingredients plus no added sugar.

The launch also marks the brand’s expansion into the billion dollar plant-based industry. The plant-based category grew ten times faster than the broader food industry in 2018, which is a trend the company is seeing firsthand. Inspired by customer demand for a dairy-free version of Mele, each of the brand’s three flavors—Rawberry, Supergreen and Cocoa-Nut—are offered in both grass-fed whey and plant-based options. The new plant-based flavors bring the brand’s product line to a total of six products.

Mele was created as a healthy solution to skipping meals and eating processed food. In a format designed for on-the-go consumption, it takes 30 seconds to make by mixing one Mele packet with 8 oz. of water in a shaker bottle. Offering more than just protein, the brand’s proprietary formulas provide the optimal balance of complex carbs, healthy fats, fiber and omegas, which collectively have powerful health benefits. A few of their star ingredients include organic coconut milk, organic flax seed, wheatgrass, mango, organic brown rice and pea proteins. With its low-glycemic index, Mele’s nutrient-dense ingredient profile boosts productivity, promotes gut health and decreases hunger.

“We’ve spent over a year sourcing the highest quality ingredients, creating blends that taste delicious, and understanding our customers’ needs,” said Lauren Benbassat, CEO and co-founder of Mele. “They want clean, functional food that delivers a nutritionally complete option at home, in between meetings, or on a flight. We’re building Mele with integrity, transparency, and a big mission.” As a part of the company’s mission to provide better food to more people, a portion of all profits go to feed the hungry. “We have an opportunity to give back and are incredibly passionate about helping others eat and live better,” added Benbassat.

Mele launched its direct-to-consumer business with 5-pack bundles of each flavor ($25; $5 per serving), a 3-pack starter ($15) that includes one of each flavor under the two protein categories and a shaker bottle ($8). Additionally, customizable subscriptions are available at 15 percent off each month and include free shipping. Customers can design their orders to include their desired flavors and quantities, as well as adjust, cancel or pause at any time.

"The National Kidney Foundation has announced that it will partner with Icelandic Glacial, an award-winning, premium natural spring water from Iceland, to raise awareness about the importance of hydration in maintaining kidney health during National Kidney Month.",2019-03-1,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/01134918/uOSTXTYS_400x400-320x320.png,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/national-kidney-foundation-announces-partnership-with-icelandic-glacial,"NEW YORK– The National Kidney Foundation has announced that it will partner with Icelandic Glacial, an award-winning, premium natural spring water from Iceland, to raise awareness about the importance of hydration in maintaining kidney health during National Kidney Month.

Starting March 1, Icelandic Glacial will donate 10 percent of online sales to the National Kidney Foundation in support of programs to help the estimated 30 million American adults affected by kidney disease. Additionally, both organizations will share information about kidneys and the role of water in promoting healthy kidneys via their respective websites, newsletters and social media channels throughout the month.

“March is National Kidney Month and we’re encouraging all Americans to take better care of their kidneys and to Heart Your Kidneys for a change,” said Joseph Vassalotti, MD, chief medical officer, National Kidney Foundation. “Water is a healthier choice for your kidneys than high-calorie sugary drinks and we’re grateful to team-up with Icelandic Glacial to help spread the word.”

“We are very excited to partner with the National Kidney Foundation to encourage people to drink water and help take care of their kidneys,” said Jon Olafsson, chairman and co-founder of Icelandic Glacial. “Our exceptionally pure water is the perfect way to keep hydrated and support good kidney health.”

Icelandic Glacial has a naturally alkaline pH level of 8.4 thanks to the natural filtration system of lava rock at the underground spring from which the water is sourced.

“We are delighted to be partnering with such a world-class brand to showcase the importance of drinking water to our supporters,” said Anthony Gucciardo, Senior Vice President, Strategic Partnerships, National Kidney Foundation.

In the United States, 30 million adults are estimated to have chronic kidney disease—and most are not aware of it. One in three American adults are at risk for chronic kidney disease. Risk factors for kidney disease include diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity and family history. People of African American, Hispanic, Native American, Asian or Pacific Islander descent are at increased risk for developing the disease. African Americans are three times more likely than Whites, and Hispanics are nearly 1.5 times more likely than non-Hispanics to develop end stage renal disease (kidney failure).

The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) is the largest, most comprehensive and longstanding organization dedicated to the awareness, prevention and treatment of kidney disease. For more information about NKF, visit kidney.org.

Icelandic Glacial is the super-premium natural spring water, bottled at the source from Iceland’s legendary Ölfus Spring, which was formed more than 5,000 years ago and is shielded from pollution by an impenetrable barrier of lava rock. The spring produces water so pure that nothing is added or taken away. As a result, Icelandic Glacial possesses exceptional balance featuring a naturally low mineral content and a naturally alkaline pH of 8.4. Icelandic Glacial is further distinguished as the world’s first certified carbon neutral natural spring bottled water for product and operation. Icelandic Glacial uses 100 percent natural green energy to fuel its production delivering a premium bottled water to discerning consumers around the world while maintaining a “net zero” carbon footprint.",National Kidney Foundation Announces Partnership with Icelandic Glacial

PathWater will be showcasing the new hybrid which combines purified water in a reusable bottle. PathWater’s partnership leaves a legacy as the first time a reusable purified bottled water will replace single-use plastic water bottles as the primary option at an event like this. The Natural Products Expo is continually expanding their sustainability efforts and this year they have hit single-use plastic bottles as a way to decrease their carbon footprint and plastic waste.

PathWater gives Expo attendees an easy route to adopt reusability in their bottled water experience, and move on from our misguided single-use plastic bottled water past. It will be exciting to see how providing a genuinely recyclable, refillable bottle with purified water as well as sponsored water refill stations will positively improve expo waste and recycling numbers.

This partnership is significant for an expo of this size and will influence sustainability measures in other sectors to finally address single-use plastic waste in their environmental efforts. Forgetting to bring a canteen will not be a problem at this Expo, people will be able to go utterly single-use plastic bottle free for the entire five days. PathWater will be giving out over 100,000 bottles to show attendees and will help people make the switch from single-use plastic water bottles. Now, whether someone knows it or not, with a PathWater bottle, everyone will be making a better choice for their health and the planet in one easy step.

PathWater is the first beverage company to introduce reusability with the new hybrid, combining purified water in a reusable bottle. Beyond being the official water sponsors, the team will be sponsoring yoga on the plaza and handing out water throughout the show. PathWater is happy to enhance the expo’s sustainability program and provide a path for people to choose better and ditch their plastic past.

In addition to the production launch, Koios will be releasing two new flavors to accompany its existing flavors, Orange Creamsicle and Root Beer Vanilla Float.",2019-03-1,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/01145002/logo.png,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/koios-to-start-production-on-fit-soda-line-release-additional-flavors,"VANCOUVER— Koios Beverage Corp. is pleased to announce it will officially start production in April 2019 on its functional Fit Soda line. In addition to the production launch, Koios will be releasing two new flavors to accompany its existing flavors, Orange Creamsicle and Root Beer Vanilla Float.

A functional beverage is a drink augmented with nutrients, supplements, or both to provide a health benefit to the consumer. Examples of functional beverages include sports and performance drinks, ready to drink (RTD) teas, and nootropic beverages sometimes known as ‘smart drinks.’

“We are incredibly excited to finally be releasing Fit Soda™ to the public,” said CEO Chris Miller. “It has been a multiyear project, and it allows us to take advantage of a paradigm shift happening in the natural and organic food space. Our own experience and analysis show that consumers are demanding healthy clean label products that also allow you to indulge simultaneously. With millennials driving trends, including food, we believe this product will resonate with fitness enthusiasts and millennials.”

Fit Soda has zero sugar, electrolytes will be made naturally, and infused with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs).

Of the nine essential amino acids, three are BCAAs: leucine, isoleucine, and valine. “Branched-chain” refers to the chemical structure of BCAAs, of which are found in protein-rich foods such as eggs, meat, and dairy products. They are also a popular supplement sold primarily in powder form.

According to Grocer.com: “Consumers are actively seeking moments that make them feel good – they are looking for indulgent experiences and brands must seek to enrich these demands by appealing to the senses. Indulgence has traditionally been considered frivolous, but that is changing as more and more people want memorable foods and drinks they can take pleasure in without feeling guilty.”

The Fit Soda line is the second phase of the Koios product launch that began in early 2018 with the production of the Company’s line of nootropic beverages intended to increase mental focus and acuity. The Fit Soda line is generally focused more on physical well-being, featuring blends that offer high levels of nutrients, amino acids and electrolytes.

The Company started pre-selling Fit Soda at its announcement in September 2018.

“The reaction from buyers and the market has been tremendous,” Miller said. “We anticipate Fit Soda penetrating 80 percent of our retail footprint within the first 120 days of being available. It allows us to add value to our existing partners and customers without ancillary marketing.”

Additionally, the Company is pleased to announce the additional release of two new Fit Soda flavors expected in Q3 of 2019: Black Cherry Cola and Sparkling Citrus.

The Company is an emerging functional beverage company which has an available distribution network of more than 5,000 retail locations across the United States in which to sell its products. Koios has relationships with some of the largest and most reputable distributors in the United States, including Europa Sports, Muscle Foods USA, KeHE, and Wishing-U-Well. Koios is also the sole owner of Cannavated Beverage Corp., a subsidiary that develops beverage products and formulas for the growing CBD market. Koios uses a proprietary blend of nootropics and natural organic compounds to enhance human productivity without using harmful chemicals or stimulants. Koios products have been shown to enhance focus, concentration, mental capacity, memory retention, cognitive function, alertness, brain capacity and create all day mental clarity. Its ingredients are specifically designed to target brain function by increasing blood flow, oxygen levels and neural connections in the brain. Koios produces one of the only drinks in the world infused with MCT oil. MCT oil is derived from coconuts and has been shown to help the body burn fat more effectively, create lasting energy from a natural food source, produce ketones in the brain, allowing for greater brain function and clarity, support healthy hormone production and improve immunity.

Existing shareholders also participated in the raise.

Nestle veteran Alberto Hernandez Lopez has also been named Dyla’s new chief marketing officer, joining the company as the FORTO brand is in the process of making the leap from 2 oz. shots to an 11 oz. RTD energy coffee line this spring.

Dyla’s ties to KDP trace back to before the July 2018 merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS); global coffee conglomerate JAB Holdings, KDP’s majority shareholder, made a small venture investment in 2017. Now officially a part of KDP’s allied brands portfolio, FORTO is yet another asset in the company’s RTD coffee strategy, positioned as an innovative, energy-focused complement to products from Peet’s and High Brew.

The brand has secured partnerships with national retail chains like Walmart, Walgreen’s and Dollar General, while also leveraging its format and packaging design into licensed brand partnerships. The brand introduced a Hershey’s branded chocolate flavor in 2017, and last year began producing coffee shots for JAB-affiliated brands Green Mountain, Donut Shop, Krispy Kreme and Gevalia that feature “Powered by FORTO” on the package.

Speaking with BevNET, Dyla founder and CEO Neel Premkumar said that the impetus for this round of fundraising arrived following the merger, which provided the opening for the brand to enter a nationwide DSD network.

“The opportunity to go DSD opened up this chance for us to not just have checkout distribution via wholesalers but also get secondary display, off-shelf display, to go smaller format with cooler door racks and larger format with floor stands and shippers,” said Premkumar.

To establish its bonafides as a national brand, Dyla has brought in an experienced hand in Jon Crecy as the company’s new head of sales. Crecy, a former VP of sales at CytoSport and sales director at Fuze, was most recently at Core Nutrition through the completion of its sale to KDP in January. He told BevNET he was attracted by the opportunity to join an entrepreneurial brand at a critical growth stage and integrate it into a “world class distribution system.”

“For me [the role] leverages a lot of my past experiences with Core, as well as past relationships,” said Crecy. “We know the system and we know the executives; they are engaged, passionate, and they want to win.”

On the marketing side, the addition of Hernandez brings another seasoned veteran to the team. As VP of integrated consumer communications at Gerber, he helped execute a comprehensive overhaul for the baby food brand that shifted the focus towards clean ingredients and more sophisticated flavors.

While Crecy builds out the sales operation, Premkumar said Hernandez will help kickstart a national media campaign to raise brand awareness. Yet he also indicated that both new hires will be a key part of helping move beyond Dyla’s existing offerings.

“You’ll see over the next year-plus, we will be launching other categories in addition to this and really leveraging this scale to grow,” he said. “That’s why these two guys ended up joining the team.”

The investment also comes as FORTO’s first non-shot product — an 11 oz. RTD energy coffee available in three varieties — is being rolled out at retail this spring. Premkumar said the investment was timed to coincide with the new product, which is currently available at Walmart nationwide, and that the brand’s marketing strategy will be informed by consumer data.

“One of the things we are doing now is testing marketing and trying to understand our impact of we advertise shots, does it halo both the shots and RTD?” he said. “I think the early learning is there’s not a clarity around our marketing that this is a shot only.

Craft brewed from roasted date seeds, MediDate Date Seed Coffee has a rich coffee taste and naturally occurring beneficial fiber, nutrients, polyphenols and antioxidants. Available in four delicious flavors, MediDate will be featured at Expo West in the North Hall, booth N642, from March 6-8, where it is also a finalist for a prestigious NEXTY Award as best new product in the coffee/tea category.

Date seed coffee intersects two categories that have seen phenomenal growth – cold-brew coffee and healthy beverages. In addition to consumers turning to beverages to supplement their nutritional and wellness needs, there is also a growing number looking for healthier alternatives to coffee. MediDate Date Seed Coffee addresses all of these needs by providing a natural energy boost as well as prebiotics, nutrients, polyphenols and antioxidants.

“Date seed coffee is a great option for people who love their coffee ritual, but don’t want some of the side effects,” said CEO Zeyad Moussa. “And people love that it tastes just like coffee.”
• Original: Craft brewed with roasted date seeds, as traditionally made by the Bedouin tribes.
• Cardamom: With its intensely sweet and savory flavor, cardamom adds a distinctive note to this traditional beverage, and is also well known for its many healthful properties.
• Oat Milk Latte: Date seed coffee is blended with creamy oat milk and lightly sweetened with low-glycemic date syrup.
• 50/50 Cold Brew: A unique blend of 50 percent Original Date Seed Coffee and 50 percent award-winning Seaworth Coffee’s Single Fin Sludge cold brew coffee. For the days that you cannot do without your half-caf!

Date seed coffee is a powerful drink in Mediterranean tradition, where it has been known for hundreds of years to nourish both mind and body, calm and cleanse the body and naturally boost energy levels. Each bottle of MediDate Date Seed Coffee is made with at least 10 date seeds, which are grown in the highly fertile soils of the Arabian highlands.

MediDate Date Seed coffee also has a unique sustainability proposition in terms of its ability to reduce food waste. Date seeds have historically been a waste product that is thrown away by the hundreds of tons a year. Tulua wants to help reduce this waste by turning this seemingly inedible product into a nourishing beverage. It has developed partnerships with several date farmers to secure the entirety of their waste seeds to help bring this mission to life.

"Having watched as oat milk fueled its successful recent round of coffee innovation, Rise Brewing Co. is betting the increasingly popular ingredient can work just as well on its own.",2019-03-4,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/04131033/RISE-Oat_Full-Width_1_Update.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/rise-brewing-co-launches-oat-milk-as-standalone-product,"Having watched as oat milk fueled its successful recent round of coffee innovation, Rise Brewing Co. is betting the increasingly popular ingredient can work just as well on its own.

The New York City-based coffee company began producing its own supply of organic oat milk last year, for use in its both its retail cafes and in a three-SKU line of nitrogen-infused cold brew lattes. (Those lattes earned a BevNET Award for Best New Product in 2018.) This Thursday, Rise will debut its oat milk as a standalone product at Natural Products Expo West 2019 and begin offering it for sale through its website in one liter Tetra Pak cartons for a suggested retail price of $5.99 and $29.99 for a 6-pack. The product will roll out at retail through Rise’s existing distribution partners, including Columbia in the Pacific Northwest and Hensley Beverage Company in Arizona.

“We always considered this as separate product, but our focus wanted to remain on coffee product initially,” said Rise co-founder and CEO Grant Gyesky. “As we saw some of the new players coming to market with oat milk, we saw a similar opening for a better-for-you organic alternative. It just kept being put in front of our face that this is something we should do.”

The move puts Rise in the middle of one of the fastest-growing and most competitive segments of the plant-based dairy space. Over the past year, brands such as Califia Farms, Quaker, Hood, Mooala and Elmhurst have launched oat milk products to capitalize on rising consumer demand and attempt to seize market share from the leading brand, Oatly.

In addition to allowing for greater production control, Rise co-founder Jarrett McGovern said that making oat milk with four simple ingredients — organic sunflower seeds from France, organic oats from Finland, water and sea salt — has allowed the company to circumvent sourcing issues that could lead to shortages, as Oatly has experienced at times.

“One of the results of us doing all the sourcing and building oat milk from scratch and not buying from supplier or another brand is that we’ve tapped into farms and sources that aren’t necessarily yet being taxed by the current oat milk market,” he said.

Within the growing category, McGovern said his brand’s product would stand out for its clean formulation, texture and taste. Much of that consumer interest in oat milk has been generated from its popularity as a coffee creamer; McGovern said that 70 percent of customers at Rise cafes drink dairy-free coffee drinks, with a majority of that being oat milk. Yet, after internal discussions, the company opted not to position its version as a barista-focused product.

“My initial direction was to tie this close to coffee, because we are a coffee company,” said Gyesky. “Jarrett kept rebutting me by saying ‘But I’m having it in my cereal.’ He convinced the team that it’s not just a product meant for coffee; it’s a better coffee alternative across the board.”

“This is the best dairy free oat milk I’ve ever had,” McGovern added. “For us, by staying a barista blend, it could have potentially limited us.”

Indeed, as Rise has grown, the brand has found itself pushing past those limits; starting from a single nitro-infused black coffee, Rise now markets six varieties, including its oat milk lattes, a dairy milk latte and two citrus-infused cold brew flavors. Though McGovern said the company will remain dedicated to coffee, he noted that each round of innovation has given Rise confidence in its ability to go further.

“We want something innovative, better than anything else on shelf, uses the best ingredients and is organic. Applying those filters towards development has allowed us to be successful with products we maybe wouldn’t think we could do in the past,” he said. “We are coffee focused, but we like to be innovative and develop solutions in beverage that are better tasting and better for you.”",RISE Brewing Co.

"Veteran CPG marketing executive Eric Berniker, who most recently served as CMO of CORE Hydration, has joined organic sports drink maker Roar Beverage Company as its new CMO and its investor AccelFoods as an operating partner.",2019-03-4,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/04160820/ROAR_Full-Width_1.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/former-core-cmo-eric-berniker-joins-roar-organic,"Veteran CPG marketing executive Eric Berniker, who most recently served as CMO of CORE Hydration, has joined organic sports drink maker Roar Beverage Company as its new CMO and its investor AccelFoods as an operating partner.

The move, completed last month, comes as Roar prepares to scale nationwide. In December, AccelFoods led a $5.6 million funding round in the brand and in January the company brought in former Chef’s Cut Real Jerky CEO Bart Silvestro to serve as COO and president.

“Post the acquisition of CORE I was looking at different brands that were intriguing to me or fit my formula for success,” Berniker told BevNET in a phone call. “For me it’s always about what the category is doing, is the brand differentiated, who are the people behind it, and is it funded? And as we all know the health and wellness trends are not slowing down, people are looking for functional beverage and to reduce sugar, for those extra attributes from their products. And for all that Roar checks the boxes.”

Berniker has 15 years of experience in the industry, working with multiple food and beverage brands which achieved sizable exits. He first entered the CPG space in 2004 when he joined Glaceau as SVP of marketing. In 2010 he joined Pirate’s Booty as VP of marketing prior to its 2013 sale to B&G Foods, and most recently he spent over three years as CMO of CORE, which sold to Keurig Dr Pepper last year for $525 million.

Berniker said he believes Roar is well positioned for success based on its vibrant branding and on-trend product attributes such as organic certification and antioxidants. He also quoted founder and CEO Roly Nesi who compared the brand to athletic apparel company Lululemon, citing that brand’s growth into a lifestyle brand popular with millennials.

“People bought into Lululemon because of what it represented, its motto, and because it’s image and lifestyle led,” Berniker said. “And that’s kind of the same thing with Roar. We see this as a brand that’s women-led but obviously open to men as well, just like Lululemon, and it’s very much a look-and-feel image that stands out on shelf. But we’re looking to build a lifestyle around the brand.”

Berniker said the brand speaks to “on the move” female millennials who are “always on, pushing the limits, and defining what success looks like.”

He contrasted the brand’s appeal to modern consumers with the marketing approach at Glaceau, noting that Vitaminwater was built with prominent celebrity endorsements, while modern influence campaigns focus on themes like inspiration and authenticity which Roar more readily symbolizes.

Sampling will also continue to be a big promotional tool for the company. Berniker said past sampling statistics have showed trial-to-purchase rates between 60 and 70 percent.

In addition to joining the Roar team directly, Berniker is also joining AccelFoods as an operating partner, where he will review marketing plans and provide strategic advice for the firm’s broader food and beverage portfolio. AccelFoods announced last month that Bart Silvestro has also been tapped for an operating partner position, along with former Beats by Dre CFO Paul Eskenazi, Food Creative CEO Paula Grant, and Kalahari Brands CEO Chris Hickey.

“I think a big part of the job will be to continue to fan the fire,” he said. “The brand last year grew 500 percent and that was with a really lean team doing some amazing things. So it’s about how do we take those things and scale them and continue to raise awareness for the brand in different ways.”",Former CORE CMO Eric Berniker Joins Roar Organic

With only one single gram of natural sugar and no artificial sweeteners, Rethink Juice Splash is positioned to be the new benchmark of health in the kid’s aseptic juice category. Rethink Juice Splash launches nationwide with two flavors: Watermelon and Fruit Punch with two more, Kiwi Strawberry and Strawberry Lemonade, coming in the second quarter. The product line will be available in Walmart and Kroger locations across in the country starting in mid-March. Retail availability will continue to grow with seasonal resets achieving more than 8,000 points of distribution by August 2019.

Rethink Juice Splash will serve as a perfect complement to their Rethink Kid’s Water line launched in 2018 and one step closer to their ultimate company goal of developing a comprehensive product portfolio capable of satisfying both child and mom, in terms of health, function and flavor. By replacing a single legacy juice box with Rethink Juice Splash – composed of 95 percent water, naturally sweetened with 5 percent organic juice concentrate and enhanced with organic monk fruit – you can eliminate up to 20 percent of a child’s daily intake of sugar. This flavorful drink is USDA Certified Organic, contains no added sugar and has only 5 calories per serving.

“We have seen low/no sugar, better for you options developed in food and snacks for kids including candy, baby food, chips, bars, frozen meals, lunchables, smoothies, and even popsicles, however, it hasn’t happened in the world of beverage,” said Matt Swanson, founder and CEO of Rethink Brands Inc. “Put another way, healthy options for a human’s most important daily consumable, beverage, don’t exist for our most important humans, children. That simply makes no sense.”

Rethink Brands intends to continue it’s pursuit to improve the healthy beverage options available to our children today. In terms of both form and functional benefit, Rethink Brands aims to rebuild a $5 billion category, left to decline, despite it’s incredible impact on the health of future generations.

Last year, Wonder Drink introduced the first and only kombucha with an organic prebiotic fiber to help promote digestive health.Continuing its goal of creating fun and functional beverages to meet consumer demands, Wonder Drink has stepped it up once again and is adding a new line of kombucha— called Prebiotic Plus—with extra functionality to focus your mind, nourish your inner radiance and hydrate your life.

Prickly Pear Cascara for focus, Turmeric Ginger for radiance, and Salted Watermelon for hydration are three enticing, tasty flavors that Prebiotic Plus offers. Ingredients like ashwagandha and cascara, sea buck thorn and biotin and electrolytes and vitamins, deliver an extra boost of something special along with a taste of something spectacular.

Each Prebiotic Plus comes in a 12 fl. oz. slim, premium-looking can and contains only 8-9 g of sugar. Like Prebiotic Kombucha, Prebiotic Plus is certified organic, guaranteed non-alcoholic, non-GMO, vegan and gluten free.

The brand, founded and led by Hilary McCain, launched their trio of hemp cannabidiol (CBD) infused sparkling waters in December 2018.

“Sweet Reason is exactly the beverage I want to drink everyday. It’s delicious, refreshing and comes in a beautiful glass bottle. And it’s healthy on all fronts – Sweet Reason has the benefits of CBD, simple ingredients and no sugar or sweeteners. We are so happy that consumers love the product as much as we do,” said McCain, founder and CEO.

Each 12 oz. bottle of Sweet Reason contains 7mg of pure hemp CBD with no sugar, sweeteners, carbs, sodium or artificial ingredients and only five calories. Sweet Reason is available at over 150 retail stores mostly in New York and retails for $6.99 per bottle. The beverages are also available online with free shipping across the continental United States.

Sweet Reason has launched with a flavor for every occasion:
• Grapefruit: The grapefruit plant is the original hybrid – the semi-sweet lovechild of the orange and the pomelo. Every sip delivers a bright citrus flavor for a truly refreshing timeout.
• Cucumber + Mint: A bubbly combination of cucumber and a hint of mint provides a crisp and refreshing way to reset your perspective.
• Strawberry + Lavender: Strawberry and lavender is that curious flavor combo that will make you wonder how you ever lived without it. We think it smells like spring and tastes like summer – the perfect way to unwind your mind.

Sweet Reason Beverage Co. uses CBD isolate (100 percent pure CBD) in their products, because CBD is one of the most well-researched cannabinoids. Using pure CBD isolate creates a consistent, high quality product every single time, with health benefits including calming the mind, reducing random stress and easing discomfort.

Founder and CEO Hilary McCain started Sweet Reason Beverage Co. to make hemp beverages that focused on three pillars: health, taste and quality. The product is a naturally flavored CBD-infused sparkling water with no sugar, sweeteners, carbs, sodium or artificial ingredients. McCain and her team spent the better part of a year finding the best water-soluble CBD on the market. It was a labor of love, but resulted in a tasteless CBD from organic hemp that is highly bioavailable and does not require added sugar or sweeteners to mask the flavor. Prior to Sweet Reason Beverage Co., McCain was president of Riverview Capital, a consumer-focused Search Fund based in Toronto. Her career has been focused on strategy and management consulting, including time at the Boston Consulting Group and Chobani. She has her MBA from Harvard Business School and her HBA from Ivey Business School.",Sweet Reason Beverage Co. Rolls Out E-Commerce Platform

Tommyrotter Distillery founders and operating partners, Sean Insalaco and Bobby Finan are committed to growing the business in a deliberate and meaningful way. Initial expansion focused on spreading across New York State and into Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Future expansion will focus on Mid-Atlantic, Mid-Western and Southeast Region States.

New hires include Lisa Viscusi as senior region manager of upstate New York and James Buckley as territory manager of New York Metro.

Viscusi has a successful sales and distribution management background in the spirits and wine industries. Most recently, she served as a senior region manager with Fetzer Vineyards, where she was responsible for distribution management, budgeting and sales planning and sales for four states. Earlier in her career, she held positions with Southern Wine & Spirits and Coors in direct ales, territory management and distribution management positions.

Buckley’s experience is dialed into the New York Metro market. Prior to joining the Tommyrotter team, he held a position as a brand development representative focusing on four high-volume driving brands, covering all five boroughs and Long Island for Blueprint Brands, a craft liquor distributor known for its strong on-premise relationships in the downstate market.

These personnel additions follow Tommyrotter’s 2018 hiring of John Boccino as its director of sales and Jarrod DiFranco as territory manager of New England.

John Boccino has over 20 years of experience in the wine and spirits industry. Earlier in his career, he held positions with Vision Wine & Spirits, Allied Beverage, Admiral Imports, Liquid International and William Grant & Sons in direct sales, territory management and distribution management positions. John Boccino joins Tommyrotter Distillery most recently from Wyoming Whiskey, where he served as the VP of Eastern Sales and was responsible for distribution strategy and sales for 15 states.

Prior to joining Tommyrotter, Jarrod DiFranco was a market manager for 90+ Cellars/Latitude Beverage where he was responsible for sales and account management for a majority of the Massachusetts market. Earlier in his career, he held positions with Moet Hennessy, BrownForman, Tiger Beer and Coors Brewing in marketing, distribution management, direct sales and merchandising.

Tommyrotter Distillery is currently searching for a key account representative to help service its home markets of Buffalo and Rochester, New York who will report to Lisa Viscusi, senior region manager of upstate New York.

Sean Insalaco, who is heading up sales efforts, said “we continue to expand our footprint in each state by adding experienced sales personnel who have strong customer relationships, a detailed understanding of their markets, and a proven track record in distribution management.”

Founded by Bobby Finan and Sean Insalaco, Tommyrotter Distillery opened its doors in July 2015. Its name harkens back to the Tommyrotters’ Club, a band of rebellious artisans in the early 20th century who broke rank from the Arts and Crafts Movement to pursue their individual truths and create for creation’s sake. They sought adventure, mischief and inspiration in nature.

But this brand is more than another storied name. While the Tommyrotter tale is full of nostalgia, whimsy and rebellion, the qualities of that history are present in the distillery’s spirits. Its old-school libations – gin, vodka and whiskey–are brilliantly revamped to offer playful, unabashed and complex flavor profiles. Tommyrotter is an independent distiller of bold, rebellious spirits.

The distillery resides in a 118-year-old converted factory in Buffalo, New York’s historic hydraulic manufacturing district. With its products currently distributed in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, Tommyrotter Distillery has developed a loyal regional following for its unique tasting products and striking packaging.

"In a saturated beverage market, consumers are increasingly seeking products that offer more than just good flavor and appealing packaging.

While some brands have adapted to create functional drinks that promise to hydrate, energize, or provide relaxation, others have chosen to cast a much smaller net, developing drinks aimed at solving less common health problems: think urinary tract infections (UTIs) or blood sugar spikes.

They aren’t the first products promising drinkable health solutions; many have been come and gone. But these new emerging brands believe they have learned from their predecessors’ mistakes by focusing on effective messaging and scientific evidence while also leaving open possibilities for growth beyond the niche audience they’ve established.

The ideas behind many single-use functional beverages often emerge from the search for an easier and more convenient solution to a long-standing problem.

In the case of Jenna Ryan, it was the thought that certain female health issues were not being properly addressed. For Ryan, an eight-year struggle with UTIs and her frustration with antibiotics as a treatment “after the fact” led her to found UTI prevention drink mix Uqora with her partner and COO, Spencer Gordon. The product, created in collaboration with physicians and urologists, is designed to capture bacteria after activities that typically result in UTIs, such as sexual intercourse or exercise..

Sweetie Pie Organics, founded by baby food industry vet Liliana Cantrell, produces a five-ingredient Lactation Smoothie utilizing fenugreek to promote breast milk production and provide convenience for on-the-go millennial moms. Cantrell saw a hole in the market as infant formula consumption rates were decreasing, and set out to create a trustworthy product that supported breastfeeding mothers, who are skeptical of big brands.

Other functional beverages were also developed by health professionals looking to bring their research to consumers.

John Mansour, a pharmacist by trade, took a shot at the prize when he created B4, a “precovery” beverage designed to provide hangover relief with co-founder Dave Larue, VP of ABC Fine Wine & Spirits.

“[Larue] knew I’m a pharmacist, a chemist, and an entrepreneur and so that combination of things really lit a fire in his mind that maybe I could help him make something,” Mansour said. “And that’s how the idea of a product began.”

Mansour spent two years developing the product, creating different iterations and trying it out on Larue and his friends. The drink, which the founders claim supplies the body with the electrolytes, amino acids and vitamins that alcohol can flush out, comes in an 8.4 oz. drink rather than a shot like most hangover recovery drinks, to ensure optimal hydration.

Meanwhile, Good Idea is a drink designed to be consumed during mealtime to reduce both the risk of chronic inflammation and post-meal fatigue. Called a “blood sugar spike regulating sparkling water, Good Idea was born out of a 10-year research project by CEO Bjorn Oste’s R&D company Aventure AB, at the Anti-Diabetic Food Centre at Sweden’s Lund University. The company’s discovery of amino acids’ potential to trigger early insulin release led to Good Idea.

Some of these beverage startups have found that they must carefully choose their wording as intended uses can often get misconstrued and quickly earn negative connotations.

Dermatologist Bobby Awadalla developed skincare supplement drink mix UVO after research showed that patients struggled with routinely applying topical preparations, leading him to create a dermatologist-recommended product which they could easily use daily. Now sold online as a skin-enhancing multivitamin drink mix, it was originally sold in stores as a ready-to-drink beverage. However, the functionality wasn’t clear, and customers misidentified the product as a substitute for sunscreen, according to Awadalla. To control its messaging, UVO moved online and switched to the powder mix format to simplify shipping large orders and thus encourage daily use.

“What we really figured out was that the messaging for the product was not really getting through to the clients, and it was largely up to the staff that was in the retail stores to talk about the product,” said Awadalla. “We felt like a lot of messaging was lost in translation. People weren’t really getting the right information.”

Awadalla noted he was adamant about avoiding misinterpretation because the FDA had previously released warnings regarding oral supplements touting their sun protection abilities. In 2017, Osmosis Skincare was sued for consumer fraud by the Iowa state attorney general over its Harmonized H2O UV neutralizer water, which claimed to protect consumers against ultraviolet radiation, according to Denver Business Journal. The lawsuit was settled for $70,000 in October 2017.

Meanwhile, B4 has evoked sun protection terminology for a different purpose. Instead of “hangover,” the brand is using the trademarked phrase “It’s like sunscreen for your liver” in its marketing to create a more positive message about the drink’s benefits and distance it from binge drinking.

“We don’t mention hangover anywhere on our can, on our product, it’s not anywhere on our website, it’s nowhere,” said Mansour. “We 100 percent drive the conversation around protecting your body and being smart when you drink.” Mansour said that B4’s goal is to provide a way to protect people’s bodies while also educating them about what happens to them when they drink.

Last year, Never Too Hungover, a shot designed to help consumers recover after alcohol consumption, changed its name to DrinkAde for similar reasons.

“We believe the new name better represents the positive essence and values of our brand and valued customers,” said Steve Glazer, DrinkAde managing partner, in a press release. “Our mission as a company continues to be to help customers enjoy life to the fullest and stay productive.”

Both brands have thus far avoided the mistakes of predecessors like Life Support, a defunct shot supplement marketed as a hangover cure which was issued a warning letter from the FDA claiming its therapeutic claims made the product an “unapproved new drug.” Herbal hangover remedy Drinkin’ Mate received the same FDA warning in 2010.

As these new brands seek to make a name for themselves, clarity is key, and e-commerce might provide the best opportunity for this.

“The fact is that you need to have a simple message and you need to have an accurate message,” said Awadalla. “The online marketplace now is becoming a place where functional brands can give a clear message and they’re not relying on second and third parties to spread that message.”

While these companies have established themselves as producers of a single-use product, they also look forward to possibly expanding their brands. Both Uqora and UVO have chosen to go deeper into their respective categories by expanding into non-beverage products.

Uqora has launched a capsule-delivered formula, and plans to introduce two more new products focused on UTI prevention are set for release later this year, according to Ryan. For right now, Uqora is focusing on e-commerce.

“We still have a ton of opportunity online, but we will definitely explore retail at the right time and with the right partner,” said Ryan.

While UVO has its sights set in the short term on new flavor formulations for its drink mix and possibly a shot-size RTD, Awadalla also said that he hopes to eventually launch a full spectrum skin cream line to rival laboratory designed topicals.

For some brands, their focus on a narrow functional proposition to use it as the foundation for a larger brand platform..

Cantrell noted that Sweetie Pie will be launching a powdered version of the smoothie this year along with a new flavor set for Q1 of 2020. The brand, available at Whole Foods, Walmart and CVS locations, is also entering Target this year, with other products in the pipeline that address post-natal issues mothers face. Cantrell also said that the brand may possibly expand into products for children.

“There is a lot of room for growth for us into pregnancy and postpartum,” she said. “Because the brand would be already connected to moms.”

For now, Good Idea is looking to integrate its product into to workplace wellness programs. Oste noted that the company is also looking deeper into how the beverage can improve the lives of Type 1 diabetics, as well as researching potential new health-focused products.

“We have a lot of the research and development going on in the labs in Sweden, so I think part of what we’re doing here is really understanding the network of dieticians and nutritionists, doctors, holistic primary care providers and professional healthcare providers because we see other products in the future that [can] come and address these markets as well,” he said.

As B4 works to build a presence outside of alcohol retailers, Mansour said he also sees wider health possibilities for B4. He noted a future powder pack launch will move away from direct associations with alcohol and instead be positioned as a hydration and a natural energy product.

“We probably would gear the conversation more towards the idea of a healthy lifestyle and having supplementation versus just talking about drinking and just talking about the idea of quote unquote hangover, especially for us,” he said.

In both current products and potential future launches, these personalized products run the risk of becoming irrelevant or outdated as new research emerges or consumer preferences change.

For some, this means conducting continual research to ensure their products remain effective. Mansour said he is willing to change B4’s formulation or add an ingredient if he finds it better supports the beverage’s functionality.

“I’m a scientist and pharmacist as a trade, but I’m also an entrepreneur and both sides of those career paths always want the best, and always want the most up to date information and always want to provide it in a way that is beneficial to whoever is on the other end,” said Mansour.

Oste, who also founded oat drink brand Oatly, said amassing substantial scientific evidence was crucial in developing Good Idea, and that future products will take a similar approach..

“It is important to us that whatever we do, whatever claim we do, we can substantially back it up with real solid evidence,” said Oste. “Clinical studies and clinical trials are inherent to our DNA and everything we do we try to study clinically to prove that it delivers real substantial health benefits.”","Effective Messaging, Evidence Key to Growth of Niche Functional Brands"

Introducing the newly redesigned Buddha Brands, one of North America’s leading coconut-based brands, which includes Thirsty Buddha Coconut Water, Hungry Buddha Coconut Snacks and Healthy Buddha Coconut Ingredients.

This new, optimized packaging for maximum shelf presence includes new designs that retain nods to the original packaging, with a new and iconic Buddha Brands logo.

Buddha Brands’ new branding offers consistency and unity across the Thirsty, Hungry and Healthy Buddha brands for better cross-category recognition in store.

“We wanted the new Buddha Brands look to reflect the fun and minimalist nature of the products,” said Chris Magnone, the company’s CEO and co-founder. “As we continue to pursue category captaincy in both Canada and the U.S., we saw this as an opportunity to turn the page on a new era for Buddha Brands. Our new look is clean and simple, like our products themselves, and is infinitely more iconic and recognizable across the three brands.Now, whether you’re shopping the cold fridges, the snacking section or the baking aisle, you’ll recognize BuddhaBrands’ products.”

“The new look is also much more photographable, giving our coconut-loving foodies all the more opportunity to snap a picture of the many ways their Buddha Brands product fits into their healthy lifestyles,” said Magnone.

Buddha Brands Company by Temple Lifestyle believes that using multiple parts of the coconut is a sustainable approach that can maximize the usefulness of the fruit. From coconut water and chips to coconut vinegar and coconut nectar, we developed “The Coconut Initiative” as a means of connecting coconut lovers through our sustainability efforts. Through careful sourcing of the finest coconuts from Southeast Asia, Buddha Brands believes that health and balance extend to the planet itself, which is why one percent of annual sales are donated to environmental and sustainable charities through one percent for the Planet.",Buddha Brands Introduces New Packaging

California-based Positive Beverage has partnered with beverage incubator L.A. Libations to fast-track the brand’s retail expansion.,2019-02-27,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/27171459/Positive-H2O_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/positive-beverage-partners-with-l-a-libations,"California-based Positive Beverage has partnered with beverage incubator L.A. Libations to fast-track the brand’s retail expansion.

Launched in 2015, Positive markets a line of electrolyte-infused sparkling drinks. Although its distribution is currently limited to about 200 stores according to co-founder and managing partner Zach Muchnick, the company anticipates scaling rapidly in 2019. L.A. Libations CEO Danny Stepper told BevNET that Positive has already received activations in Gelson’s and Bristol Farms — two retailers L.A. Libations frequently uses for incubating new brands.

Speaking to BevNET, Muchnick said he decided to restructure the company last year in response to advice received during an early meeting with L.A. Libations. Positive reformulated its line to feature a new clean label ingredient panel and transitioned from a still product to sparkling. Positive also redesigned its packaging. According to Stepper, Muchnick’s willingness to take the incubator’s advice was a significant factor in the companies partnering together.

“It’s really built for speed,” Stepper told BevNET. “There’s not a lot of consumer education that needs to happen, it’s pretty understandable right away.”

As part of its revised strategy the brand reduced the price from $2.49 to $1.99, Muchnick said, adding that Positive takes an aggressive approach to enforcing its price point in order to ensure accessibility for lower income consumers and generate high velocity rather than high margins. Muchnick said the company has limited its marketing allocations for retailers who increase prices.

“I think we’re a little jaded sometimes by living in California, and not everybody lives in Beverly Hills or Orange County or in Manhattan,” Muchnick said. “A lot of these healthy beverages are $3, $4, I’ve seen $6 and I just don’t think that people should have to sacrifice other things in their life to have a healthy beverage.”

Stepper said L.A. Libations plans to scale Positive at an accelerated rate, noting that the company is well-funded and will be able to enter larger retail accounts quickly without draining resources.

The company has been bolstered by investment from millionaire philanthropist and president of G2 Financial George Argyros, Jr. According to Muchnick, Argyros has been directly involved in growing the brand from increasing its manufacturing efficiencies to improving the organizational structure.

“George is extremely involved in Positive Beverage to the point that if I need to reach and individual or company that I don’t have access to, no matter how large or powerful, George will get them on the phone and he’ll do it within five minutes,” Muchnick said.

Positive has also received investment from The Real Housewives of Orange County star Kelly Dodd. According to Muchnick, Dodd has promoted the brand on Instagram and the drink will be featured in most or all episodes of the show’s upcoming 14th season, which is currently filming. The show’s broadcaster Bravo is also working with Positive to promote the brand at Natural Products Expo West 2019 next month.

Dodd’s involvement has also prompted Positive to participate in charities she advocates for, including the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and The Boys and Girls Club.",Positive Beverage Partners with L.A. Libations
"After less than a year on the market, Bend, Ore.-based coffee maker Riff Cold Brewed is expanding its brand platform with a new line of Sparkling Superfruit Teas made from dried cascara, which will launch next week at Natural Products Expo West 2019 in Anaheim, Calif.",2019-02-27,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/27173404/RIFF_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/riff-cold-brewed-makes-natural-energy-play,"After less than a year on the market, Bend, Ore.-based coffee maker Riff Cold Brewed is expanding its brand platform with a new line of Sparkling Superfruit Teas made from dried cascara, which will launch next week at Natural Products Expo West 2019 in Anaheim, Calif.

The new product is cold brewed, shelf-stable, and will initially launch in a single flavor called Alter Ego, in reference to cascara being “coffee’s lesser-known counterpart.” The drink features 105 mg of caffeine and 2 g of sugar per 12 oz. can and will be available for a suggested retail price of $2.99. Riff has planned for the first SKU to roll out at the end of April and is currently developing additional flavors to launch later in the spring.

Speaking with BevNET, Riff CEO Paul Evers said the company first sampled the line with consumers in its recently opened taproom prior to launching the ready-to-drink product. The extension, he said, represents the next step in Riff’s brand evolution, which Evers said is not tied down to coffee but is meant to be an open-ended platform for energy-based innovation. Cascara, being derived from the pulp of coffee beans, was a “natural” first extension for the company.

“Cascara has been on our radar since the very beginning and we thought it would be great to take our platform of cold brewing and extend it to other parts of the coffee plant,” Evers said. “We’re excited about fully leveraging what the coffee plant has to offer, so we decided this was the natural extension.”

Nate Armbrust, co-founder and director of brewing and innovation at Riff, told BevNET cascara gives the company a building block to create future innovations, noting that “it is a little bit easier than cold brew coffee” where most innovations are based around dairy. He said the company is currently experimenting with different flavors including blackberry, black currant, mango and other tropical flavors, lemon, lime, rhubarb, and celery, though he noted none of the flavors were finalized.

“Coffee doesn’t accept a lot of flavors the way that some other products do,” Armbrust said. “And I think that the coffee fruit tea, being a tea without those traditional coffee flavors that may not mix well with other flavors, really does take berry, fruit, and potentially even savory flavors really well.”

The extension also moves Riff into the natural energy space, where it will be competing with a growing number of plant-based brands like Runa, HiBall and Mati. Evers said the brand is targeting millennial and Gen Z consumers who favor natural and clean label products.

Riff has partnered with craft beer distributor Point Blank in Oregon to launch The Sparkling Superfruit Teas will launch in its 500 existing retail accounts. The company has also signed a distribution agreement with Hensley Beverage Company to service the Arizona market, Evers said, which would potentially open several thousand new doors.

“We’re looking forward to a strong spring and summer in our home state of Oregon and we’re still coming into our own and learning an awful lot,” Evers said. “But we’re getting some really strong validation at the same time.”",Riff Cold Brewed Makes Natural Energy Play
California-based Health-Ade Kombucha is preparing for a “full-on offensive court press” this summer with the launch of six new flavors and new 4-packs of 8 oz. glass bottles.,2019-02-28,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/28122211/HealthAde_newflavors_fullwidth.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/health-ade-to-debut-six-new-flavors-this-summer,"California-based Health-Ade Kombucha is preparing for a “full-on offensive court press” this summer with the launch of six new flavors and new 4-packs of 8 oz. glass bottles.

The six new additions to Health-Ade’s core 16 oz. glass bottle lineup — Cherry Berry, Grapefruit, Tropical Punch, Passionfruit-Tangerine, Strawberry-Lemonade and Peach Mango — represent the brand’s biggest ever collective launch of new SKUs and will bring the total size of its core product roster to 13. The brand will be sampling the new varieties at Natural Products Expo West next week and start rolling out to retailers across all channels this summer.

Speaking with BevNET, Health-Ade co-founder and chief sales officer Vanessa Dew said the extension represents the company becoming “a little bit more prescriptive in our flavors.” In broadening its range, she said the brand wanted to “tap into what consumer are asking for” with accessible, fruit-forward varieties like Tropical Punch and Strawberry Lemonade. The new products will contain a similar nutritional profile to the existing line, with about 7 g of sugar per 8 oz. serving.

“These are just odes to some classics that consumers are loving in other formats, and we decided to make it our own,” said Dew.

Along with the new flavors, which the brand is exploring integrating into its keg service, Health Ade is also expanding its packaging formats. Products are currently marketed in 16 oz. bottles and 64 oz. growlers, as well as a 8 oz. glass bottle exclusively for on-premise foodservice. This spring, the 8 oz. bottles will be introduced at retail in 4-packs of three different flavors: Pink Lady Apple, Ginger Lemon and Pomegranate.

Dew said interest in the 4-pack format, which will be available for a suggested retail price of $9.49, was driven mainly by retailers. The pack will launch at Whole Foods Markets nationwide in May, but not as an exclusive. According to Dew, the launch will help Health Ade understand the different occasions in which consumers are drinking kombucha, which will also inform larger internal discussions about product development.

“We are always experimenting with different product offerings and looking to the future as to what is the best format for consumers — if not in kombucha, then maybe in something else,” she said.

However, Dew was quick to dismiss the idea of introducing a canned product, calling Health Ade’s use of glass bottles in both brewing and packaging kombucha a “signature of what we do, day in and day out.”

As the brand adds new flavors and formats, Dew noted that Health Ade is also looking for ways to tie its expanding family or products together under a single banner. This includes touches like new labeling on Health Ade’s Superfood Kombucha line to provide more visual pop on-shelf and give retails options when building a branded product set.

“[The Superfoods] can stand alongside our cold-pressed line and make sense,” said Dew. “It’s a great mix-and-match play in terms of merchandising on retailer shelves.”",Health Ade to Debut Six New Flavors This Summer
"Geevani, a new Sugarcane Juice announces launching in all 187 Jewel Osco locations in the Chicagoland area in February. It is also available to purchase online.",2019-02-28,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/28151322/ffdee3e419ea99b66763-175x320.png,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/geevani-introduces-sugarcane-juice-to-u-s-markets,"LOS ANGELES— Geevani, a new Sugarcane Juice announces launching in all 187 Jewel Osco locations in the Chicagoland area in February. It is also available to purchase online.

Founder Roopa G. grew up in India drinking ice-cold sugarcane juice after volleyball. It was not until after a long hike in the Santa Monica mountains with her husband, Mark Masten, that she longed for her refreshing childhood beverage to satisfy her thirst. That is when the idea for Geevani began.

Founder Roopa G., a former finance manager at multi-billion dollar food titan, The Wonderful Company, knew it was going to be a challenge to introduce sugarcane juice to the American market. Indians treasure sugarcane juice not only for its lightly sweet taste, but because it cools and energizes the body, providing Ayurvedic health benefits. Ayurveda is an ancient holistic health practice balancing the body, mind and spirit with natural herbs and practices – the way Roopa G. inherently grew up living.

“While the taste of sugarcane juice stood out vividly in my memory, I couldn’t find it anywhere,” says Roopa G. “I knew then that, together with my husband Mark, I wanted to bring the beverage of my childhood, something that so many people enjoy internationally, here to friends and family in the U.S.”

Sugarcane Juice was recently declared as the official drink of Pakistan by the Pakistani Government and currently reigns as the same title of Egypt. Sugarcane juice is also enjoyed around the world in regions such as The Caribbean, Mexico, Vietnam and other equatorial cultures between the Tropics.

Roopa G. is determined to educate consumers that sugar cane juice is vastly different from the table sugar sitting in your cupboard. The liquid comes from the crushing of the fibrous grass stalks that can grow up to 30 foot tall, which releases the juice inside and filtered for purity. To put things into perspective, it takes 40 sugarcanes to produce one tablespoon of processed sugar.

Sugarcane has less sugar than orange or cranberry juice per serving. Sugarcane juice is also more nutritious, full of plant sterols (think wheat grass), iron, potassium and calcium, everything the modern woman is looking for. Roopa calls this ‘A Woman’s Best Friend!’.

Roopa G. partners with certified growers in Northern Mexico, just south of the Tropic of Cancer, committed to sustainable harvesting practices to produce the highest quality sugarcane to bring to the U.S. In her own production facility, she (yes, Roopa!) crushes the cane stalks and cold pressure pasteurizes the juice in small artisanal batches to ensure retention of nutrients and flavor. All ingredients are sourced fresh and juiced on site.

Geevani sugarcane juice is cold-pressed and made with under three natural ingredients with no added sugar or preservatives. It is available in four varieties now at Jewel Osco and online:

Geevani was first presented at Natural Products Expo West in 2018 and was featured in Supermarket News’ “14 Products Trending at Expo West 2018”, as well as Food Navigator’s “Beverage Spotting” from the same show. Now, Geevani is eager to hit supermarkets and bring this refreshing ayurvedic health drink to Americans, starting with 187 Jewel Osco locations. Geevani will be showcasing its products at Expo West 2019 Booth N1434

Inspired by the healing practices of Ayurveda and elevating the honest goodness of nature, Geevani is sugar cane juice enhanced with the very best cold-pressed ingredients in four flavors – lime, ginger, kumquat, turmeric and cayenne. Geevani’s flavor inspirations come from traditional Ayurveda recipes, enjoyed by cultures throughout the world. Geevani is best enjoyed as an energizing refreshing beverage any time of the day or after a long workout. Based Los Angeles California, helTHē Brands Inc., was founded on the principle that the best things in life come from the heart. The company is dedicated to bringing to market a unique range of deliciously good-for-you foods and beverages, with fresh ingredients sourced from around the world, inspired by joyful living.",Geevani Introduces Sugarcane Juice to U.S. Markets
"Bolstered by international growth, Monster Beverages Corp. beat analyst expectations in its fourth quarter and full year earnings, reporting a 14.1 percent year-over-year increase in revenue, according to financial results released yesterday by the company.",2019-02-28,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/21154055/Monster-Energy_Full-Width_11.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/monster-company-beats-expectations-for-strong-q4,"Bolstered by international growth, Monster Beverages Corp. beat analyst expectations in its fourth quarter and full year earnings, reporting a 14.1 percent year-over-year increase in revenue, according to financial results released yesterday by the company.

Net sales of Monster’s energy drinks portfolio were up 15.9 percent from $736 million in 2017 to $853 million for the full year. Net sales for the company’s Strategic Brands portfolio fell 5.4 percent to $65.8 million in the quarter.

Following the report, delivered after markets closed on Wednesday, Monster opened the day up more than 4 points. At close, the company’s stock price was up 8.67 percent at $63.83 per share.

Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog highlighted the company’s “impressive” 30 percent international growth for the quarter, driven by “robust growth” of 68 percent in Asia and 44 percent in Latin America. Despite the strong overseas growth, Herzog said she remains cautious for the company’s overall business, including increased competition from established brands like Red Bull and emerging energy brands like Bang.

During a conference call with investors and analysts, Monster CEO Rodney Sacks announced several new products in the process of launching, including line extensions for Java Monster (Java Swiss Chocolate), Ultra (Ultra Paradox), Hydro (Hydro Manic Melon and Hydro Mean Green), and NOS (NOS Sonic Sour).

In March, the company will launch two new flavors of its Dragon Tea line and six flavors of its fitness energy drink Reign Total Body Fuel, which is widely viewed as a competitive response to Bang. The Reign line will not feature Monster branding.

“The positioning of Reign is different to the positioning of Monster and we’ve made the strategic decision to not in fact make Reign a line extension of Monster,” Sacks said. “We think it should … have its own positioning, its own marketing, create its own personality and that we believe will give its best chance of success….They have their own personality and identity. So we just felt that this was the appropriate thing for us to do.”

Despite concerns from retailers regarding a 4 percent price increase on the trademark Monster portfolio implemented in November and a lack of promotions, as reported in a recent Wells Fargo survey of convenience stores, Sacks said the company is “pleased with the initial results” of the increase. The company has since implemented a 1.5 percent price increase for the NOS and Full Throttle brands effective January 1 and a 3 percent price increase in Canada on the Monster, NOS, and Full Throttle lines.

“The price increase that was planned was really carefully planned in relation to Red Bulls pricing where there were significant gaps between our price on shelf and where Red Bull was at that time,” said vice chairman and president Hilton Schlosberg. “And what we were able to do with our price increase was move us closer to the Red Bull pricing.”

Herzog said Monster management’s positive comments on the price increase were “encouraging,” but said her firm remains “cautious on the pricing environment given commentary from our retailer contacts around stepped-up promos [and] competition.” She added that the price increase “is having the intended effect of mitigating some of [Monster’s] long-standing margin pressures.”

Sacks also took time to comment on the company’s ongoing arbitration with The Coca-Cola Company after allegations by Monster that the soda giant broke the company’s non-compete clause by announcing an energy product under the trademark Coca-Cola brand. The two companies first entered a strategic partnership in 2015, with Coke taking a 16.7 percent stake in Monster while transferring ownership of its energy drink portfolio including brands like NOS and Full Throttle. As part of the agreement, Coke is barred from competing in the energy drink category.

Arbitration began in October and Coke has since delayed the release of its energy line until April. According to Sacks, Monster “cannot predict with certainty” when arbitration will conclude “but reasonably expect the resolution” sometime during the second quarter of 2019.

Sacks noted that the two companies will continue to work together regardless of the outcome.",Monster: Company Beats Expectations for Strong Q4

With NILO, which is packed with ingredients proven to aid in the prevention of hangovers, you can seize the day, everyday.

“Being diagnosed with a liver condition that gives me terrible hangovers even after drinking just two beers, inspired me to find a remedy,” said founder and CEO of NILO, Said Chedraui. “My goal was to not only improve my daily life, but also help everyone live a better and more productive life.”

The main ingredient in Hangover Recovery is a powerful antioxidant called DHM which is derived from Hovenia Dulcis, a Japanese tree. DHM accelerates liver detoxification and minimizes the negative morning-after effects of alcohol. After over a year of perfecting the Hangover Recovery formula, NILO found just the right blend of DHM and other super antioxidants such as Glutathione, Milk Thistle, Chicory Root, Vitamin B Complex and electrolytes.

Hangover Recovery is easy to use and makes it even easier to wake up the next morning:
• Step 2: Take one full bottle while drinking.
• Step 3: Go to sleep and wake up like a superhero!

Said Chedraui founded NILO in California in 2014. The premium brand was inspired by the Nile River, as this geographical landmark was the source of life to Ancient Egypt. NILO’s first product was NILO Pure Coconut Water with real coconut chunks which quickly gained popularity on the west coast and surpassed big brand names like Vita Coco and Zico in all retailers where NILO Pure Coconut Water was offered. NILO has since expanded to provide a variety of 100 percent natural Tropical Fruit drinks such as Guanabana Juice that derives from a super fruit known for its anti-Cancer properties. Its most recent product HANGOVER RECOVERY reduces the negative effects of alcohol. The company has continued to grow rapidly at 100 percent per year and selling $5MM after the second year.

“Purpose Purple Super Tea has experienced great feedback on our existing flavors, Purple Reign, Lemon Bliss, and Mint-to-Be,” says founder and CEO of Purpose Tea Chi Nguyen. “However, we wanted to expand our line to bring customers more flavors and variety that they love, as well as a sugarless option. Many people are still surprised to learn about purple tea, and to learn that it has more antioxidants than green and black tea.

Puerto de Indias Strawberry Gin is a nonconforming, disruptive gin that is taking the category by storm, quickly rising to the number four selling gin in its homeland and number nine on the world stage. Beginning in February, Puerto de Indias Strawberry Gin will be available in New York, Florida and Illinois.

Puerto de Indias, a true pioneer in innovation, has crafted this extraordinary Strawberry Gin through the expert blending of delicate citrus and juniper Gin with fresh distilled strawberries. The result is a wonderfully accessible gin with a deliciously fresh and subtle taste of strawberry and a visually stunning pink color that dares to be different.

“Our Puerto de Indias Strawberry Gin is the first and best-selling strawberry gin in the world,” said Jose Sedano, international development director for Puerto de Indias. “Beginning with our launch in Spain five years ago, Puerto de Indias Strawberry Gin has enjoyed instant success among consumers with each successive market we open and is credited with giving birth to a completely new category of rosé gins. We are absolutely thrilled to now introduce US consumers to our unconventional gin that is sure to change the way they think about gin forever. ”

Puerto de Indias Strawberry Gin is produced at the Los Alcores de Carmona Distillery located just outside Seville. The distillery was founded in 1880 making it one of Spain’s oldest and most traditional distilleries. Brothers Jose Antonio and Francisco Rodriguez Fernandez purchased the historic distillery to restore and preserve it for future generations.

The brothers began distilling aniseed, fruit and herbal liqueurs and soon shifted their sights to gin with the goal of creating a product that would challenge traditional gin conventions and tastes and appeal to a wider breadth of consumers. While their initial experimentations did not include strawberries, through an unexpected twist of events, Puerto de Indias Strawberry Gin was born.

“The birth of our prized strawberry gin was truly an accident that made history,” added Sedano. “While also experimenting with Seville’s world-renowned fresh strawberries, the brothers added some distilled strawberry mash to the gin they were crafting. The product was so delicious they bottled a few hundred cases and the rest is history.”

The name Puerto de Indias honors the 16th century when the Americas were discovered and Seville, known as Puerto deIndias, was a place of splendor and adventure and a main port for trade with the New World. The distinct bottle shape and medallion are inspired by the “Torre del Oro” (The Gold Tower), one of Seville’s most iconic monuments.

To support the launch, Puerto de Indias has established a team of dedicated State Managers who will oversee local programming, sampling and merchandising. In addition, PR and advertising efforts will help build trade and consumer awareness and support launch activities in these markets.

Puerto de Indias Strawberry Gin is available in a 750ml bottle and retails for a suggested price of $26.99.

Puerto de Indias is a Premium Gin manufactured in Carmona (Seville) in one of the oldest and most traditional distilleries in the province of Andalusia. Its name relates to the discovery of the Americas around the time when Seville was quickly becoming one of the principal trading ports for the exchange of goods between Spain and the New World. The combination of know-how and innovation coupled with dedication and careful monitoring of the distilling process have made possible the creation of a product that possesses its own distinct identity and which, having consolidated itself on a nation-wide level, has now begun its incursion into international markets.",Puerto de Indias Strawberry Gin Arrives in the US

“We finished 2018 on a strong note, successfully managing through the merger integration and achieving full year results in line with our 2018 targets,” said KDP chairman and CEO Bob Gamgort in a press release. “We also delivered strong in-market performance, growing market share in carbonated soft drinks, single-serve coffee and other key categories. Looking ahead, we are confident in our outlook for 2019 Adjusted diluted EPS growth of 15 percent to 17 percent, which is in line with our long-term merger target, despite the operating environment becoming more challenging.”

In an earnings call with media and investors, KDP chief financial officer Ozan Dokmecioglu noted an “acceleration of performance” — highlighted by a 13.5 percent increase in operating income — during the second half of last year, prior to the merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group closing in July.

Net sales in the fourth quarter reached $2.81 billion, up 0.5 percent over the same period last year. Volume and mix increased by 2.7 percent, unfavorably impacted by changes in the allied brands portfolio, including the departures of BodyArmor and Fiji. Operating income increased 12.9 percent during the fourth quarter.

Driven by growth in Dr Pepper, 7UP, Big Red, Schweppes and Sunkist, net sales for KDP’s Beverage Concentrates segment increased 4.8 percent for Q4 and 3.8 for the year, according to the company. Operating income in the segment was up 14.2 percent from last year.

In packaged beverages, net sales were flat for the quarter, offset by a negative impact of 4.2 percent from the aforementioned changes in the allied brands portfolio. Volume and mix grew by 2.7 percent, driven by strong sales performance by Canada Dry, Core, Dr Pepper, Big Red and Mott’s. Operating income increased 8.4 percent in the fourth quarter, but declined 9.8 percent for the year.

For the year, net sales of packaged beverages were up 4.1 percent to just over $5 billion, fueled by growth from Canada Dry, Bai, Core, BodyArmor and contract manufacturing; elsewhere, Fiji, Vita Coco and Hawaiian Punch recorded declines. Volume increased 5.4 percent.

During the question and answer portion of the earnings call, KDP Chairman and CEO Bob Gamgort was asked about the allied brands portfolio and well as performance of Evian.

“The Allied brand portfolio as we sit here today has been transformed versus where we were sitting a year ago,” Gamgort said, stating that these partner brands provide a source of growth, with KDP having a strong opportunity to grow newly acquired brands Evian, Forto and Peet’s. Gamgort noted that although sales for these brands were minimal in Q4 of 2018, they are “just getting started” and will serve as a “tailwind going forward” as they increase distribution.

Gamgort also stated that going forward KDP’s allied brands strategy will target equity-like agreements with a path to ownership, rather than negotiating a brand’s value after establishing a distribution agreement.

Bonnie Herzog, managing director of equity research at Wells Fargo Securities, wrote that she is encouraged that KDP is on track to deliver its synergy target of $660 million. She also noted that the company “is starting to benefit from recent pricing actions and stepped ­up brewer innovation.”","KDP: Net Sales Flat in Q4, Up 2.3 Percent for 2018"

The longtime dream and vision of close friends and U.S. Marine Corps veterans, LtCol Ian Brooks and LtCol Eric Dill, who teamed up with 15 year beverage professional Heather Pence, The Ko’olau Distillery’s Old Pali Road Whiskey is a smooth, hand-blended, oak-barrel-matured craft whiskey.

Commenting on the milestone, Brooks said: “It has always been a lifelong goal to own and run a business. For that business to be a distillery in Hawai’i, and with your best friend, is a dream come true.”

“The idea for the business started three years ago” said Dill. “But the infatuation with distilling started in 2008 when I was deployed to Iraq and there was a news release about some service members who were caught making moonshine. I was completely intrigued by the concept that someone knew how to take raw materials and turn them into whiskey. I wondered how anyone develops the knowledge to do something like that. The DIY phenomenon which is bolstered by YouTube and the internet in general, was just beginning and that type of knowledge wasn’t just a click away back then. Curiosity led the research and discovery and when a close friend launched a highly successful distillery, it was an incredible source of encouragement and motivation to have the confidence we could achieve the same success.”

“Making Whiskey, and more specifically good whiskey, is a challenge. Ian and I are both goal-oriented people but to describe us as challenge-oriented may be a more precise description. So this enterprise is right in line with our personalities,” Dill concluded.

The Ko’olau Distillery sources locally-grown corn to deliver a bourbon-style base for the mash which is then blended with four-year-old American whiskey and pure Ko’olau water at its Windward O’ahu facility. This produces a strong straight-up flavor, characteristic of good whiskies and the use of second-fill oak barrels softens the wood flavor while the local sweet corn lends a smooth caramel note.

According to Hawaiian legend, the gods reside in the ever-present mist where the Ko’olau Mountains meet the heavens. Tropical rainfall from that mist falls and is filtered for generations through volcanic rock to become pure artesian water which is the source used to create this unique whiskey.

Hand bottled at the distillery on Windward O’ahu, the very first batch, numbered 001, received a traditional Hawai’i blessing before being released to market today.

With each batch limited to 1,800 bottles, Old Pali Road Whiskey is sure to be a sought-after spirit for fine-spirits connoisseurs. For further information and where to find Old Pali Road Whiskey visit koolaudistillery.com.",Ko’olau Distillery Launches Old Pali Road Whiskey

This style is a first for Ben’s and only two batches were brewed, making it a very limited release. The release event will include live music, food pairing and sake tasting from 7-10 p.m.

Kiyoshi will be available on draft and in distinctive red 750ml bottles in the tasting room formerly known as Ben’s Penny Mart, adjacent to Ben’s Tune Up at 195 Hilliard Ave. Bottles will also be available at White Labs Kitchen & Tap at 172 S Charlotte St.

Kiyoshi is a Junmai Daiginjo, a traditional sake classification that highlights both the purity and high quality of the ingredients used. Junmai sake is brewed with only four ingredients: rice, water, yeast and koji. Daiginjo refers to the quality of the rice, specifically that it has been milled to at least 50 percent. The higher the milling percentage, the more proteins and fats have been removed, leaving pure starch for the brewing process. Daiginjo style sake is light in color and delicate in flavor and aroma.

During the snowstorm this last December, head brewer Patrick Shearer dug his car out and headed to the brewery to start brewing the first batch of Kiyoshi. He hopes to make an annual offering of premium sake brewed in the coldest part of the year, a nod to traditional brewing practices in Japan.

“Traditional sake brewers live together in the Kura, or brewery, for the brewing season and are able to attend to all facets of the brewing process. It is a very fraternal atmosphere,” said Shearer. “I had the tank space and a couple of friends willing to lend a hand. Snowpocalypse 2018 seemed like the perfect time to start this brewing adventure.”

Shearer, who moved from Portland, Oregon in May of 2018 in order to take the helm at Ben’s American Sake, is interested in experimenting with new flavors as well as traditional styles. Ben’s year-round lineup includes several infused varieties like Pineapple-Jalapeno and Lemon-Ginger, as well as two traditional styles: Junmai Ginjo “American Heavy” and Nigori “Natural”.

Shearer hopes to draw new audiences to what is currently a niche in the craft beverage market.

“Flavored sake is a very American thing and we do it well,” said Shearer. “I hope that flavored sake can serve as a bit of a gateway for folks and lead them to try traditional sake, too. It’s such a versatile beverage, and can be much more than the hot sake some of us have slammed with our sushi.”

BFG typically backs organic or non-gmo brands with $1 to $10 million in annual revenue, although Spier said that the fund can flex to invest in larger companies as well as brands with only $10,000 in revenue a month. Given the size of the companies they invest in, generally the fund takes part in seed or series A rounds. The second fund, although larger in size, will maintain this investment thesis. Spier added that investing in better-for-you and better for the planet businesses will remain a key focus.

“We’re not necessarily an impact investing group, but I hope when we look back we feel like we’ve made an impact,” Spier said. “In some cases [the social benefit] is pretty clear and in some cases the company has to work a bit harder to emphasize that.”

Fund I is not yet fully deployed, but BFG is no longer investing in new portfolio companies from it. That fund saw the group invest in roughly a dozen fast-growing, emerging brands including Caulipower, Barnana, Malk and Chameleon Cold Brew — the latter of which sold to Nestle in 2017, two years after BFG invested.

Spier has a strong background as an operator, having previously co-founded of EVOL Foods (acquired by Boulder Brands) and having served as COO of Bear Naked (acquired by Kellogg’s). As a result, he told NOSH, BFG has an advantage over other firms which don’t have on-the ground experience running brands.

“We understand some of the pain points and are able to bring that empathetic view point,” he said.

The investment climate has changed since BFG was first founded five years ago, with larger deals going to earlier stage companies and more and more acquisitions. But rather then see the increased amount of players as competition, Spier said that there’s simply more opportunity for both BFG and its portfolio companies.

“What’s important is that there’s liquidity in the market because that’s good for all of us,” Spier said. “Hopefully that continues and long-term there’s enough of a viewpoint that these private equity firms and legacy food companies continue to want to own the growth that’s coming from the segment.”",BFG Closes Fund II to Back Emerging CPG Brands

Through dedicated perseverance, they discovered that organic loose-leaf teas combined with the probiotic goodness of kefir water resulted in delicious, mellow, seriously chug-worthy beverages that nourished the body too. With tireless passion, they work to perfect each ingredient and flavor, continuing to explore and expand their expertise in progressive beverages. All eight flavors of certified organic, probiotic teas are 35 calories per bottle, contain 2 billion CFUs, are vegan, non-carbonated, made without artificial sweeteners, dairy or gluten – always made with love.

The grant will provide 5 million female farmers and their families around the world with education, resources and economic support to help them increase their crop yields, incomes and access to nutrition locally. This partnership is part of a broader effort by PepsiCo to support a more sustainable food system by empowering women in its own agricultural supply chain, including through its Sustainable Farming Program currently active in 38 countries, and by investing in multisector agricultural programs that have the potential to achieve systems change at scale.

Women account for nearly half of all agricultural labor in developing countries and work as much as 13 hours more per week than men, often without training, proper tools, like seeds and fertilizers and rights to their land. Research shows that if female farmers had the same access to resources as men, they could increase yields on their farms by 20–30 percent, potentially reducing the number of hungry people in the world by up to 150 million.

To meet the nutrition needs of a growing global population, CARE has launched She Feeds the World, the largest food and nutrition security program in its 70-year history, benefitting 50 million female farmers and their families in the developing world. As the largest private sector donor, The PepsiCo Foundation’s investment will help women access the resources they need to increase their production including land rights, financing and agricultural inputs such as seeds; access new markets for their products; and develop the skills and techniques to build resilient and sustainable farms. The grant will support women farmers in significant food producing countries and where PepsiCo and CARE work: Egypt, Guatemala, India, Nigeria, Peru and Uganda.

“As a business rooted in agriculture, PepsiCo recognizes the power of agriculture to lift people out of poverty and feed families,” said Ramon Laguarta, PepsiCo chairman and CEO and The PepsiCo Foundation Chairman. “She Feeds the World will help millions of smallhold women farmers get the resources and training they need to increase their crop yields, access markets and gain more reliable sources of income. The PepsiCo Foundation is investing in this initiative because it has the potential to create change at scale, increasing food security and enhancing the livelihoods of 50 million women farmers and their families.”

“We are thrilled to partner with The PepsiCo Foundation, which shares our belief that women farmers possess enormous potential to substantially improve family nutrition and reduce hunger. Grounded in 70 years of experience developing impactful and proven models, CARE’s She Feeds the World is a bold approach that aims to scale what works,” said Michelle Nunn, CARE’s president and CEO. “We know that we cannot do this work without engaging forward-thinking private sector partners, like The PepsiCo Foundation, to catalyze systemic and lasting change.”

PepsiCo and CARE are also launching a global campaign called “Closing the Crop Gap” to give women a platform to tell their own stories about the challenges they face in agriculture. This campaign spotlights five women farmers in India, Egypt, Guatemala, Poland and the United States with short-form videos created by female videographers from the same regions as the farmers whose stories they are sharing. Members of the public will be invited to vote for their favorite video, and in exchange, receive a credit for a kiva.org microloan that can be used to benefit other female entrepreneurs. The videographer who receives the most votes will be invited to create an extended, three-part docuseries that explores the experiences of women in agriculture. Voting begins on March 7 and more information can be found at closingthecropgap.com.

PepsiCo products are enjoyed by consumers more than one billion times a day in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. PepsiCo generated more than $64 billion in net revenue in 2018, driven by a complementary food and beverage portfolio that includes Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Quaker and Tropicana. PepsiCo’s product portfolio includes a wide range of enjoyable foods and beverages, including 22 brands that generate more than $1 billion each in estimated annual retail sales. Guiding PepsiCo is our vision to Be the Global Leader in Convenient Foods and Beverages by Winning with Purpose. “Winning with Purpose” reflects our ambition to win sustainably in the marketplace and embed purpose into all aspects of the business.

Established in 1962, The PepsiCo Foundation works with nonprofit partners and invests in the essential elements of a sustainable food system – helping alleviate hunger, manage water and waste responsibly, and support women as champions of nutrition from farm to family.

Founded in 1945 with the creation of the CARE Package, CARE is a leading humanitarian organization fighting global poverty. CARE places special focus on working alongside women and girls because, equipped with the proper resources, they have the power to lift whole families and entire communities out of poverty. That’s why women and girls are at the heart of CARE’s community-based efforts to confront hunger, ensure nutrition and food security for all, improve education and health, create economic opportunity and respond to emergencies. In 2018, CARE worked in 95 countries and reached more than 56 million people around the world.",The PepsiCo Foundation Partners with CARE to Tackle Gender Inequality in Agriculture
"California-based kombucha maker Revive is testing a new four-SKU shelf-stable sparkling kombucha line in 12 oz. cans, as part of what the brand called a refocusing on its core mission of replacing carbonated soft drinks.",2019-03-5,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/05131353/Revive_Full-Width_3.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/revive-introduces-shelf-stable-sparkling-kombucha-in-cans,"California-based kombucha maker Revive is testing a new four-SKU shelf-stable sparkling kombucha line in 12 oz. cans, as part of what the brand called a refocusing on its core mission of replacing carbonated soft drinks.

Speaking with BevNET yesterday, Revive founder and CEO Sean Lovett said making the jump from 12 oz. refrigerated glass bottles to shelf-stable cans had been one of the company’s long-term goals. He noted the format opens up new possibilities in flavors, route to market, use occasion and audience, all of which position it as a product that can take on soda.

The canned line differs from Revive’s refrigerated product in more than just packaging. The line features lower sugar (5 g) and calories (20 g), with Lovett noting the four flavors — Cherry Hibiscus, Citrus Ginger, Mango Orange and Strawberry Lemon — were developed specifically with a lighter, more refreshing drinking experience in mind.

“It’s a different experience than our traditional raw line, and we wanted to call that out in some way,” he said, comparing it to a sparkling water with health benefits. “We are seeing some folks that drink a couple of these per day as opposed to one [raw] kombucha. It is that lighter experience that we wanted to highlight.”

To create the line, Lovett said Revive “had to start from ground zero.” The company developed both proprietary equipment and a proprietary production process that could maintain flavor after pasteurization. The product also uses D111, a probiotic strain that becomes active after digestion, and delivers a similar functionality as the brand’s raw kombucha.

The line is currently in limited distribution in the Bay Area, where it is available via online retailer GoodEggs and at Oliver’s Market locations. Single-serve 12 oz. cans have a suggested retail price of $2.99 and 4-packs are priced at $11.99. The product will be introduced to the public during Natural Products Expo West this week in Anaheim, Calif.

Beyond flavor and use occasion, the canned line gives Revive the chance to take previously unavailable routes to market. Whereas the brand’s refrigerated line is distributed in California via Cold Craft — the cold-chain system run by its majority stakeholder, Peet’s Coffee — the shelf-stable product could potentially leverage Peet’s relationship with Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP), which last year partnered with the coffee maker to distribute its ambient RTD espresso line. Lovett declined to discuss specifics; “You can assume through that there will be some innovation around route-to-market,” he said.

Lovett said the company is still gathering initial consumer data and feedback from its current availability ahead of a broader launch. However, Revive VP of marketing Josh Mohr, who joined the company last June after tenures at CytoSport and Red Bull, said the product is already enhancing the brand in-store.

“As a beverage brand marketer, the most exciting thing with this item is building an in-store display off-shelf,” he said. “It allows us to be able to take our product anywhere in the store, and that’s where people discover products. That’s the moment here that’s the true unlock. A lot of people are going to be able to see this dynamic display and hopefully come into the category through Revive.”",Revive Introduces Shelf-Stable Sparkling Kombucha in Cans

Now, in 2019, when families are busier than ever and the quest for lower-sugar drinks is always on, the brand is proud to release Cool Waters, a refreshing line of great-tasting vitamin enhanced waters. Designed to keep kids happily hydrated, Cool Waters is sweetened with only a touch of organic fruit juice and enhanced with 100 percent Vitamin C—enough to make any parent cheer.

Apple & Eve created Cool Waters based on the movement toward healthier lifestyle habits for kids and parents alike. Consumers at large are drinking more water and low-to-no calorie beverages, and parents specifically seek out lower sugar, simpler and ‘free-from’ options for their kids. Cool Waters fits right in with the modern family grocery list. It is convenient to grab and go, and each box contains only three to four grams of sugar and 15-20 calories.

Cool Waters is also Certified USDA Organic, non-GMO beverage and made with no artificial sweeteners, colors or flavors. It comes in three kid-favorite flavors: Strawberry, Cherry and Tropical Punch. Made with the “always on the move” family in mind, kids will enjoy the refreshing taste from soccer practice to school lunch and everywhere in between.

“Apple & Eve is excited to introduce Cool Waters – a better-for- you hydration drink with simple ingredients that kids will love and parents will approve of,” said Seth French, president of Lassonde Pappas. “We want to provide our consumers with different options that will help them lead healthier lives, and Cool Waters is a great new product from a brand they can trust.”

As of January 2019, Cool Waters is available in select stores, with plans to expand across the U.S. Kids’ favorite new beverage will be available in an 8-count multipack with 6.75 oz. juice boxes.

" Kitu Life, Inc., the creators of Super Coffee has announced the launch of Super Espresso—a 6 oz. can loaded with 180 mg of caffeine from 3 shots of organic espresso, 5 g of protein, healthy fats from MCT oil, 40 calories and zero sugar.",2019-03-5,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/05135438/Screen-Shot-2019-03-05-at-1.53.37-PM-440x320.png,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/kitu-announces-the-launch-of-super-espresso,"NEW YORK— Kitu Life, Inc., the creators of Super Coffee has announced the launch of Super Espresso—a 6 oz. can loaded with 180 mg of caffeine from 3 shots of organic espresso, 5 g of protein, healthy fats from MCT oil, 40 calories and zero sugar.

Seventeen years after Starbucks launched their Doubleshot, Kitu is putting a healthy spin on ready-to-drink espresso. Super Espresso contains l-theanine—an antioxidant found in green tea—and MCT Oil—healthy fats from coconut oil—which together with the caffeine provide a smooth, sustained, energy boost without the crash.

“Everybody needs energy, and until now, the only fast and effective energy options on the market are loaded with sugar and artificial ingredients,” said Kitu’s founder and youngest brother, Jordan DeCicco. “Super Espresso provides the energy we all need without the sugar, and the added benefits of healthy fats and a little bit of protein.”

Priced at $2.00 per can, Super Espresso was born to be the healthy energy option for mainstream America. It is the only espresso beverage on the market that contains no sugar and has less than 50 calories. It is designed to compete with the Starbucks Doubleshot, Dunkin’ Donuts Shot In The Dark, FORTO Coffee Shot and 5-hour ENERGY.

“We all have those occasions where it’s crunch time and we need to get the job done—at the gym, at the office, or on-the-go. Super Espresso is that quick and healthy energy fix that will help everyone hit their goals and deadlines,” said Jim DeCicco CEO and oldest brother.

Super Espresso is available online through Amazon and at drinksupercoffee.com. You can also pick up our product throughout the U.S. at these retailers; Rite Aid, Duane Reade, 7-11 (Select Stores), Jewel Osco, HEB, Wegmans, Target (Select Stores) and Wawa (Select Stores).

Gottlieb was reportedly well-liked in the government, but told officials he wanted to spend more time with his family. Gottlieb worked as an advisor to President Trump’s transition team in 2016 and was appointed to the FDA post following the election. Gottlieb previously worked for the FDA as an advisor to the commissioner from 2002 to 2003 and as director of medical policy development from 2005 to 2007. In 2007 he became a partner at venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates where worked until 2017.

As head of the FDA, Gottlieb embraced the debate over labelling for dairy and dairy alternative products. In September, Gottlieb spoke out about the issue, stating that the FDA “has concerns that the labeling of some plant-based products may lead consumers to believe that those products have the same key nutritional attributes as dairy products, even though these products can vary widely in their nutritional content.” That month the administration also opened up a public comment period, which ended earlier this year.

During his tenure, Gottlieb also oversaw updated nutrition facts labelling for added sugar and crackdowns on the rising market for CBD.

In his resignation letter, Gottlieb listed several accomplishments he was proud of, including the administration’s policies to combat the rise of vaping among teenagers. In the food and beverage space, he cited the FDA’s work to improve food safety and its ability to track foodborne illness outbreaks.",FDA Commissioner Gottlieb Resigns

Audacious idea? Check. Parents’ garage as the company office? Check. Low probability of success? Check. Unlike many startups, however, Boxed has thrived since its debut. The company, dubbed the “Costco for millennials,” reached $100 million in sales in 2016 and has attracted interest from a variety of investors, who’ve injected over $243 million into the business. Last year Kroger reportedly made an offer to buy Boxed for a half-billion dollars.

Under the terms of the agreement, Ginger Shots will have the exclusive rights to produce and distribute MediDate RTD worldwide. MediDate will be featured at Expo West in the North Hall, booth N642, from March 6-8.

“Ginger Shots (Tulua) is very experienced in the promotion, distribution, sale of products similar to MediDate’s Ready-To-Drink beverages and we cannot be more excited to see how well MediDate will do in the United States,” stated Laith Alkhawaja, CEO of MediDate Coffee.

A Mediterranean staple for centuries, new MediDate Coffee is unlike any other ‘coffee’ drink you have likely ever experienced– or ever will. Made entirely from antioxidant and protein-rich ground date seeds, pure and brilliantly created to offer a calming, cleansing, high fiber, caffeine-free ‘coffee’, great for optimal bone and heart health.

While High Brew previously offered dairy-free options with its Black and Bold and Triple Shot Black flavors, as well as its newly launched Sparkling Cold Brews, it was consumer feedback from social media and field events that spurred the decision for a dairy free latte. The brand discovered fans were enhancing their cold brew with nut milk so High Brew, being a brand for “do-ers”, swung into action to give these enthusiasts a plant-based option that was delicious and creamy, right out of the can.

The company’s first foray into plant-based offerings blends coconut and cashew milk for superior taste and a rich, creamy, full-mouth feel, compared to other nut milk blends. These dairy-free options contain only nine grams of sugar (35 percent less than High Brew’s current indulgent offerings) and come in three flavored lattes: Bourbon Vanilla, Toasted Coconut and Smoked Butterscotch.

To further validate High Brew’s fan base asking for non-dairy options, the brand conducted independent research that verified nine out of ten millennials are “likely” to purchase ready-to-drink coffee with 75 percent of them stating they incorporate both dairy and non-dairy into their diet. Plant-based options are not just for vegans or those with dairy allergies anymore – they have entered the mainstream.

“High Brew is a brand ‘for those who do’ so we would be remiss to ignore something our customers are so vocal about,” said David Smith, High Brew’s founder and CEO. “We worked long and hard to create a nut milk latte that was worthy of the High Brew name with clean energy, a great taste and lower sugar than many of the alternatives on the market.”

Like all High Brew products, these new Nut Milk Lattes ($2.99) are made from 100 percent Direct Trade Arabica beans and are cold brewed over time, not heat. High Brew Coffee’s Nut Milk Latte’s will debut at Natural Products Expo West in Anaheim, California in March 2019. For more information on High Brew Coffee, visit highbrewcoffee.com.

After working tirelessly for 13 years to turn his tiny tea company into a household name, David Smith, co-founder of Sweet Leaf Tea, embarked on the sailing adventure of a lifetime. Discovering the benefits of refreshing cold-brewed coffee during warm nights navigating rough waters, the idea for High Brew Coffee was born. Founded in 2014, High Brew is an all-natural 100 percent Arabica blend ready-to-drink cold brew coffee made from Direct Trade coffee beans. Brewed with zero heat, High Brew Coffee offers premium low-calorie cold-brews in smooth, delicious flavors such as Double Espresso, Mexican Vanilla, Salted Caramel, Dark Chocolate Mocha, Black & Bold and Creamy Cappuccino + Protein. The brand also recently launched three Sparkling Cold Brew Flavors in Classic Black, Vintage Vanilla and Midnight Mocha, as well as Milk Chocolate + Protein, with 3 grams of fiber and 12 grams of protein.

"As the ready-to-drink coffee category continues to grow and innovate, California-based VIVIC launched last month with a line of sparkling coffees, which its co-founders hope will stand out with unique flavor profiles infused with roots and botanicals.",2019-03-6,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/06180546/vivic-fw1.png,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/vivic-launches-botanical-infused-sparkling-coffee-line,"As the ready-to-drink coffee category continues to grow and innovate, California-based VIVIC launched last month with a line of sparkling coffees, which its co-founders hope will stand out with unique flavor profiles infused with roots and botanicals.

VIVIC was co-founded in 2018 by GacLife beverage developer Graham Gould and former chef and Looplocked Wines owner Louis Abruzzese. Speaking with BevNET, Gould said he first developed an early recipe for sparkling coffee in 2016 while working at Taylor Lane Organic Coffee, but his idea was shot down as “unproven” in the marketplace with “no clear data that people want this.” About six months later, he said, in early 2017 Stumptown Coffee Roasters launched their own line of ready-to-drink sparkling cold brews, a development he said gave him confidence in the concept and led him to start his own company.

Gould and Abruzzese cited the rise of nitro cold brew as evidence that consumers are seeking out new and innovative approaches to coffee, but Gould cast doubt on its longevity. He said sparkling has stronger potential to become an important space within the category, calling it “the most refreshing way to drink coffee.”

“We’re basically the missing link between your teas and your cold brews,” Abruzzese told BevNET. “We felt like coffee should be treated as an ingredient and developed a beverage keeping that in mind.”

Despite interest in the category from both established and startup coffee companies, RTD sparkling coffee is still a relatively new trend for U.S. consumers. Stumptown discontinued its sparkling line last year, telling BevNET that it was “an experiment.” In 2017, Chameleon Cold-Brew announced its own sparkling line which was produced for a pilot test, and last year High Brew attempted a line which founder David Smith said will likely serve as a summer seasonal variety. Smaller companies like Slingshot Coffee Co. and Clutch Coffee Roasters also already have sparkling coffees on the market, but position their drinks as “Soda” and “Pop” respectively.

But VIVIC has sought to distinguish itself as a low sugar, low calorie alternative with more refined flavor profiles than its competition. The line includes Original, Lavender, and Sarsaparilla flavors and retails for $2.99 per 9.5 oz can. Each can contains 30 calories, 8 g of sugar and are also sweetened with licorice root to keep the sugar level low and add additional gut health functional benefits.

“The fact that we are a low sugar product really is going to help us,” Gould said. “Consumers are becoming more and more aware of how much sugar they’re consuming, and I think that was one of the issues Stumptown had.”

Gould added that the company hopes to take market share from multiple categories, including current coffee, tea, and yerba mate drinkers.

VIVIC launched last month in 24 stores in North California, including Berkeley Bowl, Rainbow Grocery, and Driver’s Market. The brand has partnered with distributor Rock Island Refrigerated Beverage and is also developing a keg program to begin servicing corporate offices in Silicon Valley. According to Abruzzese, the company plans to focus on building in the San Francisco Bay Area this year, but hopes to launch soon in Los Angeles and later New York.

VIVIC is also planning to launch three new SKUs this summer which are currently in development. Bringing their culinary backgrounds to the table, Gould and Abruzzese said they pride themselves on developing rich and unexpected flavors.

“I think it’s time for the industry to break down those barriers and experiment with flavors that work well with coffee that aren’t just traditional flavors,” Gould said. “So we look at our recipe development with a wider perspective, just pulling from different inspirations we encounter in our daily lives.”",VIVIC Launches Botanical-Infused Sparkling Coffee Line

The product is designed for restfulness and recovery and includes a magnesium, tart cherry and electrolyte blend that work together to support the body’s natural relaxation responses. Today’s active consumer is challenged with finding simple solutions that calm and repair their body and mind from both exercise and other stressors in life. Nuun Rest combines magnesium and tart cherry to aid in restoring the body’s natural state, reducing stress levels and inflammation, and improving muscle recovery. Nuun’s electrolyte-rich and hydrating effervescent tablets are an effective, convenient vehicle to deliver the benefits of Nuun Rest.

“The modern athlete and anyone seeking an active lifestyle are looking for products that perform well and are the best for their overall health. The wellness and sports nutrition worlds have converged,” said Kevin Rutherford, Nuun Hydration’s president and CEO. “I’m extremely proud of what the Nuun team has accomplished with Rest, creating a new category of recovery, focused on calming the body and mind, which we all can appreciate achieving more of throughout our busy lives.”

Magnesium is one of the body’s most widely used electrolytes responsible for over four hundred biochemical responses that help ensure your muscles and nerves are functioning properly. Research suggests magnesium aids the body in managing the added stress of exercise, and life in general. Due to the importance of magnesium for exercise function, magnesium losses are high among athletes. It has also has been reported upwards of 50 percent of the general population are deficient in magnesium. Nuun Rest includes 300 mg of fast absorbing magnesium to help restore the body’s natural resting state.

“The primary goals of exercise recovery are to allow the body to repair and heal itself, and these physiological gains are maximized when the body is less stressed and more calm,” added Vishal Patel, Nuun’s senior research and development manager. “Your muscles and nerves first have to be able to relax before your body is able to effectively absorb the work. There was a gap in the natural recovery market to support these mechanisms, and the innovation goal of Nuun Rest was to create an electrolyte and phytonutrient solution to aid in reducing this stress.”

Over the past several years, there has been a growing body of scientific and clinical research linking the benefits of consuming tart cherries to improved exercise recovery. Athletes and health enthusiasts alike have realized the anti-inflammatory properties of tart cherries. This response is due to the anthocyanins, the dark red pigment of the fruit. Tart cherries are also rich in the phytochemical melatonin and naturally have the ability to help your body produce more melatonin. When the brain releases this hormone, it is found to put the body in a more restful state and improve sleep. Nuun Rest contains over 200 mg of a specialized whole tart cherry extract powder.

Alongside a significant dose of magnesium and tart cherry powder, Nuun Rest includes the hydrating electrolytes sodium and potassium helping your body absorb the fluid and functional nutrients. Like all Nuun products, Nuun Rest is third party verified Non-GMO, Informed-Sport and Kosher, in addition to being vegan and gluten-free.

It is recommended to dissolve each tablet of Nuun Rest in four to six ounces of water, and to consume it during periods of relaxation and prior to going to sleep. The product is debuting with two flavors: Lemon Chamomile and Blackberry Vanilla. There are ten tablets per tube and the retail price is $6.99.

Retailers including Whole Foods, Wegmans, HEB, Gelsons, CVS and many others will be carrying the innovative line of plant based functional beverages.

“In the coming weeks we will be announcing partnerships with several additional national retailers who are bringing in our delicious line,” said co-founder Cindy Kasindorf, a nutritional health counselor who created the line in her kitchen less than two years ago. “I am guided by the principle that Food is Medicine and my goal with Remedy Organics was to bring delicious functional nutrition to consumers in mainstream and natural channels, it is incredibly rewarding to see my vision become a reality.”

“We have spent the past year and a half incubating the brand in the Northeast where we were fine tuning our formulations, building our team and establishing a rock solid manufacturing, supply chain and logistics infrastructure. In addition, we have more than tripled our shelf life and now scaling this brand and significantly expanding our distribution footprint,” stated Remedy co-founder and CEO Henry Kasindorf. “We exhibited at Expo West last year and although we had a great show, we were not prepared for the high level of interest from large national retailers that wanted to bring on our line. We just were not ready last year and did not want to over-extend ourselves and expand too quickly,” said Kasindorf. “As a serial entrepreneur I love growth, but the beverage industry requires great discipline. well managed growth and flawless execution. We see this as a marathon and not a sprint and have taken our time to get to this point with a focused growth strategy and are now proceeding and executing on our plan,” said Kasindorf.

Remedy Organics launched at Expo East in 2017 and immediately received great recognition from retailers and tremendous validation from the industry. In their first year of business the company was selected for the prestigious Chobani Incubator and were finalists at FoodBytes!

The company shared samples of a 2 oz. organic juice shot that contains hemp extract at the Natural Products Expo West trade show held this week in Anaheim, Calif. The SKU, called Relax, is being deliberated as a potential new addition to Suja’s line of high pressure processed (HPP) cold-pressed juice shots introduced in July 2018. It contains chamomile, blue spirulina and 25 mg of hemp extract.

According to a spokesperson for the brand, the product is in an exploratory phase and not currently in production. Samples of Relax shared at Expo West may differ from the potential final release and contracts with suppliers have yet to be finalized, according to the spokesperson.

If authorized, however, the launch would represent the first major U.S. beverage company to enter the CBD-infused drink category.

Coke invested $90 million in Suja in 2015 at a reported $300 million valuation. The soda giant did not exercise an option to purchase the company last summer; Suja has been up for sale but has not yet found a buyer.

CBD has fast become one of the most talked about new functional ingredients in the food and beverage world since the passage of the latest Farm Bill, which legalized the cultivation and production of industrial hemp on a federal level. Industrial hemp is defined as any part of the hemp plant which contains less than 0.3 percent THC, which is the psychoactive component in cannabis.

Speaking with BevNET, Suja chief sales officer Nicole Vidaurreta said retail partners such as Costco encouraged the company to expand its shot offerings; the brand also shared another new flavor, Focus, which contains caffeine (60 mg) and L-theanine (120 mg) per 2 oz. serving.

While Suja and Coke haven’t yet crossed the breach into the hemp and CBD space, another widely distributed soda company, Reed’s Inc., introduced a CBD product at this year’s show: Reed’s Wellness Ginger Beer with Hemp Extract, available in Original and Zero Sugar varieties in 10 oz. slim cans.

"— Ice Age Glacial, an ultra-pure water sourced from ancient glaciers within the Coast Mountains of British Columbia, has debuted in North America including select U.S. and Canadian markets.",2019-03-7,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/07163741/45333283.-red...blue_.-.500ml-192x320.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/ice-age-glacial-debuts-in-north-america,"BRITISH COLUMBIA, Canada— Ice Age Glacial, an ultra-pure water sourced from ancient glaciers within the Coast Mountains of British Columbia, has debuted in North America including select U.S. and Canadian markets.

What sets Ice Age Glacial apart from spring water is its purity, smoothness and low mineral content — with the lowest amount of total dissolved solids (4 PPM) out of any bottled water in the marketplace. Ice Age Glacial water is nitrate-free, sodium-free and chlorine-free.

1.6 million years ago during the beginning of the last Ice Age, vast parts of Canada were covered by glaciers. Today, despite that the last Ice Age ended nearly 10,000 years ago, many mountains still rise to heavily glaciated peaks across Canada, including the largest temperature-latitude ice fields in the world.

Pure glacial water sources are very rare. 200 kilometers Northwest of Vancouver in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia, the ancient ice fields of the Toba Inlet form the source of Ice Age Glacial water. Natural glacial water of unmatched purity is collected as it naturally melts and flows from the edges of the towering and ancient glaciers in the Toba Inlet deep in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia; land protected by government and secluded in nature, shielded from civilization and industry. As the water falls, it is collected, which results in naturally pure glacial water with a low mineral content, yet still containing rare minerals only found in ancient glaciers.

Capturing the water before it falls into the ocean allows consumers to enjoy the pure glacial taste without disrupting the water table. Ice Age’s natural glacial water is then transported to a nearby zero waste, cutting-edge bottling facility that follows the strict guidelines of both Health Canada and the FDA.

Ice Age Glacial is available in two different varieties. Its signature is an ultra-pure still water, bottled for a taste of a world untouched since the last Ice Age. The other variety is Ice Age 9.5 (pH), a premium high alkaline glacial water infused with minerals and electrolytes, made to enhance hydration and replenishment. Both varieties of Ice Age Glacial are now available in BPA Free Plastic (350ml, 500ml, 750ml and 1L). Ice Age is available on shelves in health food and grocery stores in select markets across North America and nationwide on Amazon.com.

"Lawmakers in Indiana have proposed a bill to ban the sale of energy drinks to minors, according to ",2019-03-7,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/07170414/BN_Press-Clips_Full-Width_1.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/press-clips-indiana-lawmakers-seek-ban-on-energy-drink-sales-to-minors,"Lawmakers in Indiana have proposed a bill to ban the sale of energy drinks to minors, according to Tristate Homepage.

If passed, Senate Bill 369, introduced on January 10, would make it a class C misdemeanor to “sell, give, or distribute an energy drink” to a minor. The bill defines an energy drink as a soft drink containing 80 mg of caffeine per 9 fluid oz. and “any methylxanthine other than caffeine, any form of vitamin B, or an herbal ingredient.”

According to the Mayo Clinic, healthy adults should not consumer in excess of 400 mg of caffeine per day.

Should the bill pass, it will go into effect on July 1.

Similar legislation seeking to ban energy drink sales to those under 16 was also proposed last month in Connecticut, according to CT Post.

“Researchers have demonstrated that the high amounts of caffeine, together with other stimulants in energy drinks, lead to serious health effects, such as seizures, diabetes, and cardiac abnormalities, especially in children, adolescents, and young adults,” said Sally Mancini, director of Advocacy Resources at the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, in her testimony, according to CT Post.

Another similar bill was also proposed last year in South Carolina, but no statewide bills banning energy drink sales to minors have yet been signed into law.

Many know the story of how Dr. Robert Cade created Gatorade at the University of Florida, but few know about Cade’s second creation, Cholesterade. An article published in Tampa Bay Times on Feb. 26 took a look at the researcher’s second, far less famous beverage.

In the 1990s, Cade was struggling with high cholesterol and began research on his second drink at USF, creating a drink powder with 7 grams of soluble fiber, which can reduce the bloodstream’s absorption of cholesterol, according to the Mayo Clinic.

While the beverage didn’t make it to shelves before Cade’s death in 2007, James Price, the CEO of St. Petersburg’s Go Epic Health and one of the drink’s first backers, negotiated with Cade’s family in 2017 to manufacture the product.

While the drink is currently not FDA-approved, Price told Tamba Bay Times that the trials were promising.

Cholesterade is now available in 5,000 stores across the country, including Albertsons and Wegman’s, and will be expanding to 3,000 in the coming months.

Responsibility for Pepsi’s Gatorade brand digital marketing has shifted to TBWA\Chiat\Day Los Angeles, according to AdWeek.

“Chiat will continue to be our creative AOR in addition to taking on select digital marketing efforts for the brand,” a Pepsi representative told AdWeek.

TBWA\Chiat\Day L.A. was first responsible for the Gatorade account in 2008, but in 2010 Pepsi moved to VMLY&R as digital AOR.

This news comes after Pepsi’s announcement last October that it had ended its more than eight year relationship with VMLY&R, the agency in charge of digital and social media for Gatorade and Tropicana.

“As we look ahead to 2019 we will be evaluating a differentiated model within the digital space,” a representative for Gatorade told AdAge in October.

Sparkling CBD beverage company Recess opened a pop-up store in New York City last month called, according to CNBC. The pop-up, called Recess IRL, is the company’s first brick-and mortar store.

Along with selling Recess products, the neon pink store also hosts events such as Acupuncture for Creativity, an ABC’s of CBD panel and silent disco yoga. The company, which largely relies on Instagram-based marketing rather than traditional advertising, designed the pop-up to make customers feel like they are “walking into Instagram,” according to Witte.

“It’s a little bit of an experiment,” Recess founder and CEO Ben Witte told CNBC, noting that while the company is currently only a beverage business, it has its sights set on other products. “In the future, we will also go much deeper into content,” Witte said. “Think of us as more of a media company.”

While Recess signed a lease for just a few months, Witt said that this will likely be extended. He also stated that Recess hopes to open another location in Los Angeles.",Press Clips: Indiana Lawmakers Seek Ban on Energy Drink Sales to Minors

Three Trees new flavors are carefully made with loads of organic nuts and seeds, and contain no preservatives, gums or anything artificial. Made with just five ingredients including organic pistachios, the new Pistachio Nutmilk has a rich buttery flavor and is excellent over cereal or in chai tea, added to baked goods, or as its own warm comforting drink. The Black Sesame Nut and Seedmilk is made with organic almonds, organic black sesame seeds, as well as organic dates that add a natural hint of sweetness to the product. Black Sesame is extra thick and creamy with a bold dark and toasty flavor which is great in smoothies, baked into cookies or simply consumed on its own.

“We knew we wanted to add to our portfolio, but we wanted new varieties to be unique and different from what’s already out there,” said Jenny Eu, founder of Three Trees. “So we took our time, and developed new products that are truly special and will provide our customers with even more nourishing plant milk options that are simple and delicious.”

In addition to launching new flavors, the company’s packaging has recently received a refreshing new look. All four flavors, including flagship products Original Almondmilk and Vanilla Bean Almondmilk, are now packaged in a newly-designed 28 oz. bottle. This decision was based on an enormous amount of customer feedback indicating that the price the Original Almondmilk and Vanilla Bean Almondmilk was too high. The lower price makes Three Trees products more accessible to discerning customers who want great-tasting foods that are healthier and better for the environment. Customers who find the new packaging, but not the new price should bring the discrepancy to the attention of their store’s manager or contact Three Trees customer service.

Three Trees Almondmilks are currently available in natural foods stores and supermarkets nationwide including select Whole Foods, Bristol Farms, Central Market, Gelson’s, New Season’s, Mom’s and PCC for a suggested retail price of $6.99 per bottle.

Founded by Jenny Eu in 2013, Three Trees is committed to creating the purest, most delicious and most nourishing nutmilk on the market, for a better you and a better planet. Three Trees plant-based milks are thoughtfully made with only 2-5 real food ingredients and are naturally delicious.

Audacious idea? Check. Parents’ garage as the company office? Check. Low probability of success? Check. Unlike many startups, however, Boxed has thrived since its debut. The company, dubbed the “Costco for millennials,” reached $100 million in sales in 2016 and has attracted interest from a variety of investors, who’ve injected over $243 million into the business. Last year Kroger reportedly made an offer to buy Boxed for a half-billion dollars.

So how has Boxed, which is less than six years old, achieved this position? We recently sat down with the company’s co-founder and CEO Chieh Huang to get the answers. In our conversation, he spoke about his background and why the acquisitions of Whole Foods and Jet.com were critical to the development of the company. He also discussed the evolution of mobile commerce, the importance of user experience and customer service, and how Boxed curates its product assortment and utilizes consumer data. And in one of the most notable moments of our conversation, Huang explained why he believes the future of online food shopping “will feel like Netflix.”",Ep. 152: Why Boxed’s CEO Believes The Future of Online Food Shopping ‘Will Feel Like Netflix’

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail giant that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores and grocery stores across the globe.

Walmart has more than 11,200 stores operating under 55 banners in 27 countries around the world. It has e-commerce websites in 10 countries. Each week, nearly 265 million customers and members shop at Walmart.

“Working with the world’s largest retailer is an honor,” said Koios CEO Chris Miller. “Walmart has begun carving out significant shelf space in select locations to build the next generation of better-for-you brands, and we are truly excited to be one of them. Making the world a healthier place is our mission and our relationship with Walmart will be a tremendous catalyst for reaching a mass audience for our brand.”

Koios developed a proprietary nootropic formula that has been shown to enhance brain function, including mental focus, memory and concentration. Its formula includes superfoods such as lion’s mane mushroom, which contains bioactive substances with beneficial effects on the body, brain, heart and gut. The Company produces the formula as a line of healthy, organic beverages and drink powders.

Launched last year, the Koios brand had been carried primarily in several health store chains, and various grocery chains until December when GNC – the largest health and wellness company in North America – initiated a vendor partnership.

Now, Walmart will soon be adding the Koios beverage line to its new functional beverage set. Initially, Koios products will be available in 1,094 Walmart locations across the United States. The retail giant will carry Pear Guava, Blood Orange and Peach Mango beverages. The products will also be available through Walmart’s online portal at walmart.com and will be available in stores April 1, 2019.

Miller continued, “The vendor agreement is a pivotal development for a Denver-based startup that has become a standout in the functional beverage industry.”

Koios has been rapidly expanding its production capacity and its distribution network across Colorado and more widely across the United States. The Company works in the fast-growing functional beverage space.

The Company is an emerging functional beverage company which has an available distribution network of more than 5,000 retail locations across the United States in which to sell its products. Koios has relationships with some of the largest and most reputable distributors in the United States, including Europa Sports, Muscle Foods USA, KeHE and Wishing-U-Well. Koios is also the sole owner of Cannavated Beverage Corp., a subsidiary that develops beverage products and formulas for the growing CBD market. Koios uses a proprietary blend of nootropics and natural organic compounds to enhance human productivity without using harmful chemicals or stimulants. Koios products have been shown to enhance focus, concentration, mental capacity, memory retention, cognitive function, alertness, brain capacity and create all day mental clarity. Its ingredients are specifically designed to target brain function by increasing blood flow, oxygen levels and neural connections in the brain. Koios produces one of the only drinks in the world infused with MCT oil. MCT oil is derived from coconuts and has been shown to help the body burn fat more effectively, create lasting energy from a natural food source, produce ketones in the brain, allowing for greater brain function and clarity, support healthy hormone production and improve immunity.

Walking the show floor at Natural Products Expo West 2019, held last week in Anaheim, Calif., it was hard to argue otherwise. In the wake of the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill in December, which legalized the cultivation and production of industrial hemp on a federal level, beverage makers are seizing the opportunity to jump into a category estimated to reach $22 billion in sales by 2022, according to cannabis market research firm Brightfield Group.

From ambitious startups to established category leaders, CBD and hemp-based beverages were everywhere at Expo West this year, spanning across the spectrum of formats, functionality and flavor. In this slideshow gallery, we highlight some of the notable hemp-based and CBD-infused drinks from Expo West 2019.

Vita Coco Vita Coco shared an early look at a CBD-infused sparkling coconut water in a 12 oz. can that is reportedly set to launch this July. The product contains 20 mg of full spectrum hemp oil. California Juice Co. One of several new 2.2 oz. organic juice shots showcased by California Juice Co., Releaf contains 100 mg of full spectrum hemp extract (courtesy of Ojai Extractions), along with coconut water, Hawaiian turmeric, lemon, ginger, honey, black pepper oil and cayenne. BluePrint Organic One of the early entrants into cold-pressed juice, BluePrint Organic is now making inroads into the CBD space with two new enhanced wellness shots: Gut Instinct and Tuck In & Good Night. Drink420 The simply named Drink 420 is a line of low-calorie flavored sparkling waters that contains 15 mg of CBD per can. The product is currently available in the United Kingdom in two flavors -- Wild Berries and Elderflower Lime. Hempi Available in two function-forward SKUs -- Sleep and Awake (with 40 mg of caffeine) -- the two new 2.5 oz. shots from Hempi each contain adaptogens and 10 mg of CBD per shot. Lumen New brand Lumen showcased its two varieties of 2 oz. cold-pressed hemp juice elixirs - Restore (with ashwagandha) and Immune (with turmeric). Reed's One of several new products introduced by Reed’s at the show, the brand’s new Wellness Ginger Beer with Hemp Extract is available in Original and Zero Sugar varieties in 10 oz. slim cans. Weller Hemp-based snack company Weller shared samples of its first foray into the beverage category: a just-launched three-SKU line of flavored sparkling water enhanced with 25 mg of hemp-derived CBD. Elmhurst Plant-based milk specialists Elmhurst 1925 brought its new line of hemp-based creamers to Expo West. Made with real hemp cream, the Unsweetened variety will be available this month in 16 oz. cartons for a suggested retail price of $4.49. Navitas Combining 20 mg of hemp-derived CBD with organic functional ingredients, the new four-SKU line of 2.5 oz. wellness shots from Navitas is available in Calm (pictured) (acai lemonade), Bliss (goji berry), Focus (matcha ginger) and Restore (turmeric citrus) varieties. 4Pure 420Pure, a new line of shots from organic lemonade brand 4Pure, contains 10 mg of full spectrum CBD per 2.5 oz. single-serve bottle. Each flavor -- Blueberry Lemonade, Raspberry Lemonade and Pure Lemonade -- contains between 25 and 30 calories. Cadence Cold Brew Wisconsin-based cold brew coffee brand Cadence shared samples of its nitrogen-infused ready-to-drink CBD coffee, available in a single unsweetened flavor. Oki First announced in September 2018, Canadian brand Phivida shared samples of its Oki line of hemp-infused beverages. The brand offers iced teas (pictured) and functional waters.

"Cure Hydration, a new wellness brand focused on clean and effective functional beverages, has announced their launch.

Cure’s first product is an all-natural hydration powder that packs four times the electrolytes of leading sports drinks, without the added sugar and artificial ingredients. Made with a base of organic coconut water and pink Himalayan salt, it dissolves in water and is ready to drink within seconds. Cure will launch with three flavors — Wild Thing (Mixed Berry), Main Squeeze (Lemon) and Golden Hour (Ginger Turmeric).

Cure closed a pre-seed round in August 2018 with strategic investors including Andy Roddick, the founder of RXBAR, CEO at Thrive Market and hip-hop artist Nas.

“The market for functional beverages is heating up,” said Andy Roddick, former world number one professional tennis player. “When I first tried Cure, I was blown away. The product flat out works. It helps me recover from training and stay hydrated while I travel.”

Lauren Picasso, former director of marketing at Jet.com and Harvard Business School alum, had the idea for Cure while training for a triathlon. “I would come back from long runs and feel totally depleted and nauseated no matter how much water I drank. The problem is you need electrolytes to recover from that level of physical exertion, but I couldn’t find a product that wasn’t loaded with sugar and artificial ingredients.” Determined to find a solution, Picasso set out to create a product that “could hydrate as effectively as Pedialyte, but with better-tasting, organic ingredients, and none of the junk.”

It is a common misconception that a person needs 8 glasses of water a day to reach ideal hydration, but Dr. Dana Cohen, author of Quench and integrative medicine specialist says, “the reality is that water on its own isn’t enough to hydrate sufficiently — especially if you have an active lifestyle. Electrolytes, especially sodium, get depleted when we sweat, and when we don’t replenish them, we end up feeling fatigued both physically and mentally.”

Cure’s formula is based on Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS), originally developed by the World Health Organization to treat severely dehydrated patients across the globe. Each pack of Cure contains the precise balance of glucose and electrolytes specified by the WHO to enable optimal hydration for athletes, travelers and anyone looking to improve their health.

“Our formula is based on over 50 years of research on ORS — which has been shown to hydrate as effectively as an IV drip,” said Alex Sarkissian, co-founder and head of growth at Cure. “We found a way to achieve the ORS formula with natural ingredients.” Cure derives its glucose and potassium naturally from organic coconut water, and compared to most sports drinks does not add any additional sugars or artificial sweeteners like sucralose. “Cure is unlike every other sports drink and hydration product on the market in that we don’t sacrifice ingredient quality in order to achieve effectiveness,” says Sarkissian.

Cure is on a mission to end global dehydration. In partnership with Pact, a non-profit that focuses on public health and economic development in marginalized communities, a portion of all Cure sales will go directly toward humanitarian aid around the world. “Our mission is to empower others to achieve the full potential of body, mind and spirit through natural, clean and effective products,” said Picasso. “That’s why we’re proud to partner with Pact, a non-profit that’s directly engaged in helping to ensure that all people throughout the world are able to live healthy, thriving lives.”

Cure will be available for purchase directly through the company’s website (curehydration.com) and other major e-commerce marketplaces such as Amazon.

What’s next for Cure? The brand has plans to expand into brick and mortar by the end of the year and will roll out additional functional beverages across new categories. “Hydration is just the beginning,” said Picasso.

Cure Hydration is a natural electrolyte powder based on the standards for Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) – each pack contains 4x the electrolytes of leading sports drink, but has no added sugar or artificial ingredients.

– Hudson News Distributors has announced an agreement with Illy North America to distribute Illy ready to drink coffee to its retail network in the Northeast market.

One of the popular SKUs – the Unsweetened illy caffè espresso contains only 5 calories for a 6.8 o.z. can.

Illy, the global leader in high-quality, sustainably sourced coffee is headquartered in Trieste, Italy and was established in 1933.

We insure that the last five feet of the path-to-purchase, whether shelf or cooler, is executed flawlessly.”

Hudson News Distributors made its start in 1918 and established a reputation by delivering books and magazines to retailers across the Northeast, but as the migration of print publications go digital, the company began offering other categories to its significant distribution network.

“We have a huge infrastructure that has been built over many years that includes 14 warehouses, 400 delivery trucks, and 2,000 merchandisers,” Dowdy said.

The company can strategically support high quality, well-known brands and beverage like Illy RTD Coffee, and others in the snack and FMCG category, which represent a significant opportunity especially with our available distribution capacity.

“We have a footprint of 15,000 retail stores which includes regional grocery chains, C-Stores, national retailers (like CVS Pharmacy, Target and others), airport retailers and over 2,400 independents,” said Dowdy. “Our DSD services to these stores multiple times per week creates huge critical mass efficiencies for brands.”

"With growing concern about the environmental impacts of plastic straws, the food and beverage industry urgently needs an alternative solution. SIG’s new paper straw offers such a solution.",2019-03-11,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/11112855/676464149.sig_.paper_.straw_.solution.rgb_-262x320.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/supplier-news/2019/sig-announces-paper-straw-solution/,"With growing concern about the environmental impacts of plastic straws, the food and beverage industry urgently needs an alternative solution. SIG’s new paper straw offers such a solution.

Markus Boehm, CMO at SIG, said: “We saw an opportunity to address concerns about marine litter and offer added value to our customers by helping them meet consumer and regulatory demand to scrap plastic straws. This win-win is a great example of how our commitment to go Way Beyond Good for the environment is delivering real business benefits.”

Nestlé is the first customer to introduce SIG’s paper straw solution and has already tested the market launch in the Dominican Republic.

Michael Schwan, manufacturing manager RTD, dairy strategic business unit at Nestlé said: “We are committed to improving the environmental performance of our packaging and addressing the critical issue of single-use plastics is an important part of that. We need effective, scalable solutions and SIG’s new paper straw has the potential to meet that need.”

SIG does not make straws, but some of its portion-size packs are designed to be used with a straw for convenience on the go, and the company has been working with suppliers to develop alternatives.

Paper is renewable and recyclable. This forest-based material already makes up 70-80 percent of SIG’s cartons on average, and the look and feel of paper also visibly reinforces its environmental credentials to consumers.

SIG worked closely with a manufacturing partner to develop an innovative and exclusive solution that makes the paper straw robust enough to pierce the closed straw hole of SIG’s aseptic cartons. The wrapper for the straw has also been redesigned to help prevent litter by remaining attached to the pack to be recycled along with the rest of the carton.

The new paper straws will be made of paperboard from FSCTM (Forest Stewardship CouncilTM)-certified forests or other controlled sources. Customers can already include the FSC label on any SIG carton and they will be able to add the label to the paper straws once the manufacturing partner has completed FSC Chain-of-Custody certification, which is expected during the second half of 2019.

The new paper straw solution supports SIG’s efforts to use more renewable materials. The initial volume of paper straws will be limited during the launch phase, as SIG ramps up capacity with its manufacturing partner. SIG is also continuing to invest in new ways to apply this alternative straw solution to a wider variety of packaging formats.

SIG is determined to collaborate with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders to find new approaches to reduce single-use plastics, foster recycling and minimize waste. Helping customers improve the sustainability of their products is an important part of the company’s commitment to go Way Beyond Good by putting more into the environment and society than it takes out.

The new accounts bring the brand’s total retail footprint to more than 2,500 doors nationwide.

According to COO John Timar, Sprouts will stock Kill Cliff’s entire beverage portfolio, which was rebranded and extended last year. In June, the company added an energy and pre-workout line, Ignite, which complements the company’s Endure and post-workout Recover lines. Speaking to BevNET, Timar said multiple retailers have brought in the full Ignite line since its launch, including Hy-Vee and Army, Navy and Marine Corps Exchange stores, with “close to 30 facings” in Marine Corps stores.

“We’re really focused on appealing to an active consumer base with Americana messaging and putting forward the DNA of our brand,” Timar told BevNET. The company was founded by military veterans and has worked closely with organizations that benefit veterans.

Timar said Ignite is seeing fast-paced growth, “selling at a rapid clip faster than anything” the company has previously released. As resets approach, he said the extended line will continue to expand nationwide which the company anticipates will generate triple-digit growth in 2019.

Timar said Kill Cliff had set a goal of 250 percent distribution growth this year, but the company has nearly achieved that goal by the end of Q1. He said Kill Cliff is focused on expanding within the natural channel in order to capture its core health-focused consumer demographic.

“We’re not going to say yes to everybody who knocks on our door,” Timar said. “We’re looking for partners, we’re looking for people who share our commitment to giving back, who share our commitment to military and veterans, who share our commitment to better-for-you products, and to have a consumer base either regionally or demographically where we excel.”

Audacious idea? Check. Parents’ garage as the company office? Check. Low probability of success? Check. Unlike many startups, however, Boxed has thrived since its debut. The company, dubbed the “Costco for millennials,” reached $100 million in sales in 2016 and has attracted interest from a variety of investors, who’ve injected over $243 million into the business. Last year Kroger reportedly made an offer to buy Boxed for a half-billion dollars.

So how has Boxed, which is less than six years old, achieved this position? We recently sat down with the company’s co-founder and CEO Chieh Huang to get the answers. In our conversation, he spoke about his background and why the acquisitions of Whole Foods and Jet.com were critical to the development of the company. He also discussed the evolution of mobile commerce, the importance of user experience and customer service, and how Boxed curates its product assortment and utilizes consumer data.

Although well established in Europe, the brand was introduced to American audiences as a non-dairy offering for coffee drinks in Intelligentsia coffee shops. Fueled by its popularity with baristas, it swiftly built a strong on premise business in other specialty cafes before launching into retail a year later.

Part of Oatly’s success came from its deliberate approach to the U.S. market, which involved introducing only a small portion of its broad European product portfolio (original, low fat, and chocolate varieties in multiserve packs) for the retail business. At the same time, the company worked to drive growth through trial by selling its barista blends in on-premise and hospitality channels. Vibrant branding helped Oatly thrive on social media, though it says most of its fervent support among consumers (who are loyal to the point of creating Oatly Halloween costumes) is organic — a result of a strong, disruptive product playing in the fast-growing dairy alternative category.

While Oatly is currently front and center of the trend, it is facing an increased competition. At Natural Products Expo West 2019 this month, oat milk’s increased prominence in the plant-based milk space appeared to be confirmed, as brands including Quaker Oats, HP Hood, Silk, Califia Farms, Happy Planet, MALK, Elmhurst Milked, Rise Brewing Co., and Mooala all showcased their respective takes on the trend on the show floor.

But while a “rising tide lifts all ships” metaphor for building the category applies, the challenge for many of these new oat milk products is in how to differentiate and prove they’re not just chasing Oatly.

Oatly’s entry into the U.S. was well timed to take advantage of the rising market for non-dairy milks, which in a category rife with innovative takes on plant milk — from almond to cashew to pea protein to flax to coconut — oat has emerged as one of the most exciting to entrepreneurs. According to Mintel, grew 61 percent between 2012 to 2017 to reach more than $2.11 billion in sales.

For some brands, Oatly’s success educating consumers about oat milk was seen as a greenlight to launch their own oat milk products.

“In my mind it’s been an opportunity for a while, so we were ready to plug it in as soon as the market, as soon as the consumer understood what it was and that there was actually a category there,” Mooala CEO Jeff Richards told BevNET. “We didn’t have the power to sell the category at our small size so once the category started to evolve we had the product ready to go.”

Like Oatly, Canada-based Happy Planet has been an established brand in its home country for more than 25 years, but only just made the leap into the U.S. market in 2017. But unlike the Swedish company, Happy Planet is better known in Canada for its dairy milks, juices, and lemonades. The oat milk line is exclusively for the U.S. market.

“Plant milk, and oat specifically, is really an attractive category because of the fact that it delivers on the things people are looking for,” Kyle Marancos, director of marketing for Happy Planet, said. “They’re looking for a great tasting product, they’re looking for something for their health, and they’re looking for something to take care of the planet.”

Speaking with BevNET, Marancos said the company has long had an interest in the emerging dairy alternative space, and that oat milk alone has been growing at more than 65 percent year-over-year. For Happy Planet, the source ingredient also fits nicely into its environmentally-conscious brand identity; oats, Marancos said, are a more sustainable crop that requires seven times less water than almonds. The company, which offers barista blends and multiserve packs, is further differentiating by launching a single-serve kids line.

Larger corporations are also paying close attention to the spike in interest for oat milk. Last year, PepsiCo-owned Quaker Oats announced it was entering the plant-based drinks space with its Oat Beverage line — one of the few brands on the market to avoid using the word “milk.” The line launched in January in 48 oz. multi serve bottles. That same month, Danone-owned Silk announced its oatmilk line, Oat Yeah, which launched with plain, vanilla, and chocolate varieties in 64 oz. cartons.

In December, Massachusetts-based dairy company HP Hood introduced Planet Oat. At Expo West, Planet Oat VP of marketing and R&D Chris Ross told BevNET the company “saw the advent of oat” about two to three years ago, but that it was the spike in sales for oat milk barista blends and coffee lattes over the past year that prompted the company to jump in.

The brand is currently in about 70 chain retailers, including Kroger, Food Lion, and Albertsons Safeway. It is also distributed through AmazonFresh, but Ross said he hopes to build an authentic image with consumers by targeting on-premise growth in independent cafes and by recruiting brand ambassadors.

For Mooala, Richards said the differentiator for his brand is having USDA Organic certification, a label which he said is underrepresented in the plant-milk space. While distribution of its core banana and almond milk lines is larger, Mooala’s oat milks are currently sold in Whole Foods, Costco, H-E-B and Central Market, Albertsons Safeway, and Fairway, along with independent accounts.

“I think there’s a general assumption in the marketplace that plant-based just equals organic and so part of our job is to dispel that myth and clarify that there is a difference,” Richards said. He noted that being organic increased production costs and forced the brand into a higher price range, but so far having the certification has paid dividends.

Califia Farms founder and CEO Greg Steltenpohl is no stranger to the plant-milk space, having first dabbled in an oat milk product in 1997 while still at the helm of juice brand Odwalla. Steltenpohl acknowledged oat milk’s potential to play a significant role in the category and said he did not want Califia Farms’ entry into the space to be just another new product, but rather a platform play.

The brand has released both a standard oat milk SKU as well as a barista blend. But Califia’s latest product, he believes, will herald in what he hopes to be the next stage in plant milk’s evolution: moving away from trying to imitate dairy and towards creating unique products with added functional and nutritional value. At Expo West, the company launched Ubermilk, a line of oat-milk-based beverages fortified with pea protein, sunflower oil, flaxseed oil, vitamins and minerals.

“There has always been this argument that ‘there’s not enough protein and milk has these other benefits,’ so we analyzed what those benefits were and thought about how we could actually make a better milk for humans, not for cows,” Steltenpohl said. “It’s not a reaction, it’s an inquiry into what’s better. And I think what was missing from the soy industry and the pea-based industry was the lack of complementary amino acid profiles. It’s not an arms race for a numerical value in front of the words ‘grams of protein.’”

Although they utilize an oat milk base, the Ubermilks don’t call out that fact on the front label. Steltenpohl said he didn’t want consumers to assume the line was just another tag along chasing a trend.

But as brands seek to take advantage of the momentum Oatly helped create, none appear to be attempting to face the company head-on by working exclusively in oat milk. Rather it has proven popular as a line extension for existing companies to experiment with, whether it is an oat-focused company like Quaker Oats making a natural step or an outside innovation, such as the case of coffee maker Rise, which last year announced a new line of oat milk lattes. CEO Grant Gyesky told BevNET the company began producing its own oat milk for its latte line, and opted to begin selling it as a standalone product — boasting an organic and clean label approach to help it stand out on shelf. But from a business perspective the line is low-risk, Gyesky said. At best, it could become a significant expansion for the company; at worst it can be discontinued without damaging the core business.

As more brands continue to roll out new oat milks, Steltenpohl said his main worry is that the industry could let a trend get ahead of quality.

“Oat milk opened the door but now the industry — and we like anybody else — need to know how to make it well and make it in abundance,” he said. “Underneath all of this is the impact of this show [Expo West] and the trends that are marched out of this, and how fast mainstream grocery and even mass pick up on the ideas that they see here. But they like to see good execution.”",Expo West 2019: Oat Milk Innovators Look to Stand Out

Sunshine Bottle Works handcrafted yerba mate tea will be available at local retailers in San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. The first four offerings will include mint, peach, berry and unsweetened yerba mate tea.

Many people may not be aware of what yerba mate actually is. The yerba mate plant (formally known as theIlex paraguariensisplant) is a South American plant which has been cultivated for many centuries, it is the drink of choice in many parts of South America and the Middle East. The leaves and twigs of the plant are dried out and, like tea, contain a good amount of caffeine and antioxidants along with a host of other health benefits.

Commonly described as bitter, earthy and vegetal, the taste is not like black or green tea and is quite distinctive. Organic and Fair Trade yerba mate leaves from Brazil are combined with organic yerba mate extract and organic cane sugar, along with other all natural flavors are brewed and blended to make these refreshing drinks.

“We decided to integrate two types of yerba mate into our beverages,” said owner Doug Martin. “The brewed green mate contains lots vitamins, minerals, amino acids, polyphenols and antioxidants along with great flavor, and of course the natural caffeine content. We also utilize an expensive, roasted extract which gives the tea a darker color and another layer of robust, earthy flavor but takes away some of the bitter.” In addition, Martin notes that they are adding a proprietary blend of antioxidants including organic beet root, sea buckthorn, barley grass and goji berry, all increasing the functional antioxidant aspect of the beverage.

Mate is known, among other things, to help with boosting the immune system, weight loss, concentration and better digestion. Yerba mate contains a variety of polyphenols such as the flavonoids quercetin and rutin along with three xanthines – caffeine, theobromine and theophylline, the main one being caffeine.The sweetened Sunshine teas have only 95 calories per 16 oz. bottle and the unsweetened version has only 5 calories. All beverages have 160 mg of naturally occurring caffeine.“Our Sunshine yerba mate drinks are for people who want healthy refreshment along with that extra energy boost without loads of sugar and all the fake and chemical ingredients found in many beverages today.”

Martin is confident that it will be a hit. “I brewed a lot of test batches in my little kitchen, worked on the recipe for almost a year. Many of my friends and family gave me feedback on what they liked and didn’t like, and the final product became more and more refined. There were a number of factors: sugar, acid, mate of different origin and cuts, varying levels of extract, various types of flavors and possible additives in different quantities – it was such an enjoyable but tedious process. In the end, my testers were begging to brew more! I really hope folks here on the central coast love the products as much as I enjoyed brewing them.”

The new release bottles are the world’s first ready-to-drink crystal elixir that includes healing plant-based super herbs.

Anne Hulett, CEO of Rock Grace, wanted to combine the healing powers of crystals and adaptogens and provide an alcoholic alternative that made you feel good.

“It’s not just that Rock Grace delivers a nice experience or a pleasant taste, it’s that drinking Rock Grace makes you feel good and that is the missing piece in all other non-alcoholic beverages positioned for alcoholic alternatives. I don’t drink Rock Grace to pretend that I’m drinking alcohol, I drink Rock Grace simply because it makes me feel good,” said Anne Hulett, CEO of Rock Grace.

With the rising trend of non-alcoholic beverages and the use of crystals and adaptogens becoming more main stream to promote health and wellbeing, Rock Grace is creating a new space for non-alcoholic beverages that can play in the alcoholic beverage field. They plan to feature their beverages in stores like Whole Foods right next to the Rosé.

Rock Grace is now accepting pre-orders on their website rockgrace.com/shop and using the funds to make more Rock Grace and give 3 percent of their quarterly net profits to Shatterproof, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to ending the devastation addiction causes families.

Many people are already catching on to the Rock Grace lifestyle as they wait for their order and have been representing Rock Grace proudly by wearing hats and using Rock Grace glasses for mindful drinking.

Rock Grace is setting the stage for next generation drinking with a bottled crystal elixir infused with crystal energy and healing botanicals and adaptogens that encourage vibrational alignment and stimulate strength, grace, beauty and love. The energy of the crystals and fine botanical and super herb ingredients enhance the elixir calming anxiety and stress while promoting mental and physical wellness and empowerment.

Anne Hulett, CEO of Rock Grace, wanted to improve the quality of her lifestyle by cleaning up her diet and beauty routine and exploring natural health remedies for stress and anxiety.

She found several lovely health and beauty products promoting wellness and balance to use for her daily routine, but couldn’t find a substitute for alcohol that promoted relaxation, positive energy, wellness and beauty. She saw a huge gap, in a space she defines as next generation drinking, for non-alcoholic wellness beverages designed for people that love to drink alcohol and want to start drinking with intention and without the hangover.

She believed non-alcoholic didn’t have to be boring and wanted to add excitement to the non-alcoholic beverage options offered while being social, glamorous, enjoying down time and taking the edge off; something to celebrate with that didn’t take away from all of the healthy habits she had put in place and didn’t have all of the negative side effects she experienced from alcohol, but would still help manage stress and anxiety and give her the sensation of taking a break and having a glass of wine.

After extensive research on alternative health remedies, she grew a deep fascination with and passion for crystals and adaptogens and their healing powers. She noticed the power these two energy balancers contained, the harmony they created, combined the two and what she was looking for was born, Rock Grace.",Rock Grace Announces Launch Date for New Non-Alcoholic Beverage

As one of the industry’s most prestigious showcases, Masters of Wines & Spirits represented an ideal occasion for Martell Cellar Master Christophe Valtaud to open his library of extremely old and rare eaux de-vie and select Martell Millésime 1898.

The oldest of the great cognac houses, founded by Jean Martell in 1715, Maison Martell is renowned throughout the world for the finesse and elegance of its cognacs. At the origin of the uniquely generous Martell style isa profound attachment to the terroir, perpetuated through nine generations of the Martell family, and a savoir-faire defined by two uncompromising choices: the double distillation of exclusively clear wines and aging only in barrels of fine-grained oak, the better to reveal the authentic aromas of the grapes.

A love of the land, a family spirit, a heritage of craftsmanship – these enduring values are at the heart of Martell Millésime 1898. Selected by Martell Cellar Master Christophe Valtaud, this cognac from the prestigious terroir of Grande Champagne is not only rare and exceptional by its age and origin, but also a unique invitation to step into the history of Maison Martell. The eau-de-vie was distilled in 1898 by Gabriel Martell, who was both a winegrower and a director of the House. When he died, his widow ceded this cognac from their estate, the Domaine de Cressé, to Maison Martell, which has watched over it for more than a century. Eaux-de-vie from Grande Champagne are characterized by their outstanding potential for aging, attaining their full expression only after40 years. Painstakingly nurtured by generations of cellar masters, Martell Millésime 1898 is distinguished by its extreme lightness and finesse, naturally combined with great richness and complexity.

Light amber in colour with luminous golden highlights, Martell Millésime 1898 reveals delicate aromas of dried flowers and fine spices. On the palate, the impression is one of freshness and richness, with notes of red and black fruit and subtle hints of rancio. In the remarkably long finish, notes of dried fruit and mellow woods accompany the smooth, lingering sensations of Martell Millésime 1898.

A prestigious, one-of-a-kind offer Maison Martell has produced just one bottle of Martell Millésime 1898 for the whole world. It will be offered for sale during the Masters of Wines & Spirits event in Singapore at a recommended price of SG $39,200.

Hip-hop artist and celebrity G-Eazy is an investing partner and co-creative director of the company, which Beckerman alleges now is in mortal danger due to the financial malfeasance of Bacardi and the other financial partners.

Bacardi is trying to coerce a buy out at substantially below market value. The lawsuit alleges that “Bacardi convinced Beckerman to provide it inside access and control of Stillhouse through a series of false representations and promises of support. To induce Beckerman to relinquish majority ownership and control of Stillhouse, Bacardi represented to Beckerman that it would in the future bring Stillhouse “in house,” by buying all of the equity of Stillhouse, including Beckerman’s, at a fair market price.”

The lawsuit claims that in February and March 2019 the company has seen record breaking success and sales, and Bacardi has “schemed to take the Company on the cheap,” and has “cut off funding for the Company.” In a recent email, Bacardi admitted that “Stillhouse faces critical funding needs, and that they are very time sensitive” but “Bacardi will not be willing to provide additional funding unless and until a deal is completed or very near completed.”

Bacardi has presented a take it or leave it offer to all of the equity holders, to sell their interests in Stillhouse at substantially below market value – and if not funding ends, despite the company’s success.

Is this the message Bacardi wishes to send to entrepreneurs – and celebrities – who build brands with them?

As the lawsuit notes: “Bacardi has put a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the Board. Bacardi’s offer is for Stillhouse to transfer all of its assets to Bacardi for no upfront payment to the company or to any of the minority members. For the minority members, Bacardi has offered payments that are contingent upon Stillhouse reaching certain case volume thresholds and would not be paid out until at least five years from now.”

Bacardi is asking Beckerman, G-Eazy and other partners to negotiate with a gun to their head. This, despite the fact that Stillhouse has become one of the fastest growing and most innovative spirits companies in the United States. Stillhouse has achieved nationwide distribution for its products, with sales in all 50 states through large retail chains Wal-Mart, Publix, Target, Costco, Walgreens, BevMo, Meijer, Total Wine & More, among many others.

In 2018, Stillhouse shipped nearly 50,000 (nine liter) cases and is on pace to ship over 70,000 (nine liter) cases in 2019. Stillhouse also recently obtained, and has pending, valuable patents and trademarks relating to its innovative packaging.

"As the milk alternative category’s consumer base grows from dairy-aversive adults to include their children, plant-based protein drink maker OWYN is the latest company to introduce a kid’s line of dairy free milks, which launched earlier this month at Natural Products Expo West 2019.",2019-03-28,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/28170745/OWYN_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/owyn-broadens-scope-with-dairy-free-milk-for-kids,"As the milk alternative category’s consumer base grows from dairy-aversive adults to include their children, plant-based protein drink maker OWYN is the latest company to introduce a kid’s line of dairy free milks, which launched earlier this month at Natural Products Expo West 2019.

OWYN, which was acquired in 2017 by CPG portfolio company Halen Brands just months after its 2016 launch, has quickly shown itself to be one of the fastest growing ready-to-drink protein brands in the category. Speaking with BevNET, Halen Brands CEO Jason Cohen said the company has found a loyal audience among active millennials but saw a white space in the market for those consumers’ children.

“We have a lot of momentum right now on the brand,” said CMO Mark Olivieri. “In the natural channel we have a really strong, loyal consumer base where we’re actually the number one velocity [protein drink] item at most of the key banners within the natural channel. So there’s a lot of people who know who we are and know the benefit of OWYN, so we want to leverage that to now have the offering available for their kids as well.”

While plant-based competitors such as Ripple have also released kids lines in recent months, OWYN products feature low sugar at 5 g per 8.5 oz Tetra Pak serving. The line is formulated with pea protein, flax, pumpkin seed, and quinoa and includes Vanilla and Chocolate varieties. It will retail between $1.99 – $2.49 per unit.

“At a lot of retailers, for example Starbucks, more than 30 percent of consumers walk in looking for a milk alternative to put in their coffee, but in the cooler set for their kids there’s no milk alternative,” Cohen told BevNET, noting OWYN hopes to target food service and provide competition for kid-focused dairy brands like Horizon Organic. “We’re going to focus on the brand’s early input by getting single-serve activation and then going into our key natural consumer retailers where the brand’s strength has resonated the strongest to begin with.”

Cohen added that the line is free of the top eight allergens, making it a safe drink for school lunches.

In addition to the kid’s line, the company also launched two new flavors at Expo West — Turmeric Golden Mylk and Cookies n’ Cream. According to Cohen, the turmeric flavor was launched online direct-to-consumer as a limited edition product, but will enter Erewhon as a retailer exclusive. Cookies n’ Cream will launch nationwide.

While OWYN may be targeting children with its latest line extension, the brand is also preparing to cater to Baby Boomers as well. According to Olivieri, OWYN is preparing to launch a meal replacement line later this year, with Expo East in September set as a tentative launch date. The line has been formulated and packaging has been designed, he said, but the company is spacing out product releases to ensure a smooth rollout for the children’s products.

“We have our millennials, but also their parents are now walking around with OWYN instead of Boost or Ensure and they’re asking for vitamin essentials in a full meal replacement,” Olivieri said. “So while we’re not necessarily targeting Baby Boomers, we think that we will make them feel better by having a meal replacement option built on the millennial culture that they’ll be able to participate in.”",OWYN Broadens Scope with Dairy-Free Milk for Kids

"Did you know that CBD can help to treat a hangover? Apparently, it’s true! There is one Colorado company that has made it its mission to tell the world about it.",2019-03-29,,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/top-shelf-mixers-releases-cannabis-jalapeno-bloody-mary-mix,"LITTLETON, Colo.— Did you know that CBD can help to treat a hangover? Apparently, it’s true! There is one Colorado company that has made it its mission to tell the world about it.

Top Shelf Mixers, an industry leader in high-end cocktail mixers, recently launched its first “cannabis” product which includes a healthy dose of 50 mg of cannabidiol (CBD) per bottle. Its Cannabis Jalapeno Bloody Mary Mix is made with all-natural ingredients, and it’s infused with nutraceutical CBD extracted from organic Colorado hemp, or cannabis sativa.

“We literally hand-pick all our ingredients, we don’t use any additives,” said co-founder JR Hindman. “And the CBD we use is a hemp-derived ‘nanoemulsion’ extract, which helps to improve the bioavailability and enhance the therapeutic effects when you take it. Our formula is also 100 percent plant-based, THC-free, non-GMO, vegan, and free of all chemicals and solvents. I really think it’s the healthiest and tastiest bloody mary mix on the market today.”

In addition, the company claims that its pioneering new product is “a hangover’s worst enemy,” and there is actually some rather compelling evidence to support that. As it turns out, studies have shown that CBD can help to prevent hangovers by lowering toxicity levels in the blood stream, reducing neurodegeneration and counteracting the negative effects of alcohol on the liver. That is if you take it while drinking. As a remedy, CBD also has properties that can effectively fight the most common symptoms of a hangover including headaches, dizziness, and nausea.

“People are already embracing the idea of CBD-infused cocktails all around the world,” said Hindman. “It’s a whole new category of products, and it’s growing in popularity every day.”

So is this the newest brunch trend?

Top Shelf Jalapeno Cannabis Bloody Mary Mix is currently available at liquor stores and bars throughout Colorado, a state where CBD and hemp extracts are legally allowed in foods and beverages thanks to its 2018 Hemp Foods Bill. Once the laws are updated at the federal-level, which is expected to happen very soon, you will be able to find these products at stores all across the country. Hindman also hinted that the company might be launching a Cannabis Margarita Mix this summer, so keep any eye out for that too in upcoming months.

Top Shelf is a nationally-distributed brand of premium cocktail mixers with facilities and offices in Colorado Springs, Aurora and Boulder, Colorado. They are an innovator in CBD extracts and beverage infusion techniques, and partnered with some of the most respected hemp producers in the state. They also pride themselves in using only the highest-quality, all-natural ingredients, and its mission is to continue to deliver groundbreaking new cocktail mixers that can help to combat a drinker’s number one nemesis: the hangover.

The future of Monster Energy Corp.’s latest innovation has been thrown into doubt after facing a legal challenge from competitor Vital Pharmaceuticals (VPX Sports).,2019-03-29,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/29114358/Bang_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/vpx-sports-suit-threatens-to-reign-in-monster-product,"The future of Monster Energy Corp.’s latest innovation has been thrown into doubt after facing a legal challenge from competitor Vital Pharmaceuticals (VPX Sports).

In a complaint filed yesterday in U.S. District Court Southern District of Florida, Florida-based VPX accused Monster of trademark infringement, trade dress infringement, and unfair competition over its use of “REIGN,” which Monster announced as the name of its recently debuted performance energy drink in January.

“Monster and Reign Beverage have launched a knockoff brand—called REIGN—to shamelessly copy and cause consumer confusion with VPX’s popular BANG brand of energy drinks,” the complaint states.

The suit contends that in December 2016 a third company, Wyoming-based DASH LLC, registered the REIGN trademark for use in a variety of products, including dietary and nutritional supplements; dietary and nutritional supplements used for weight loss; dietary supplement drink mixes; herbal supplements; and nutraceuticals for use as a dietary supplement.

According to a document attached to the complaint, JHO Intellectual Property Holdings, of which Owoc is CEO, obtained the exclusive licensing rights for the trademark from DASH on March 12.

To add to the confusion, according to the complaint, Monster and Reign Beverage, a Delaware-based LLC that lists Monster as its sole member, each respectively own intend-to-use trademarks for “energy drinks,” “fitness drinks” and “soft drinks” that use the term “REIGN.”

In an Instagram video posted yesterday to its verified account, Bang Energy CEO Jack Owoc announced the launch of its own product called REIGN, which is packaged in an 8 oz. bottle and described as a “pre-workout energy drink.” The product is also referenced in the complaint.

“Today is the launch of our new energy drink called Reign,” Owoc says in the clip. “Don’t be fooled by the Bang knockoff 16 oz. Reign product by the makers of Monster. I, Jack Owoc, am the sole and exclusive owner of the USPTO registered trademark ‘Reign.’”

The complaint also accuses Monster’s REIGN for infringing on its trademarked tagline “Potent Brain and Body Fuel” by using the phrase “Total Body Fuel” to promote the product. Furthermore, the suit contends that Monster intentionally created a visual identity for REIGN that is “nearly identical and confusingly similar to VPX’s BANG energy drinks.”

Attorneys for VPX are seeking for the judge to decree that VPX is the exclusive owner of the REIGN trademark associated with all dietary and nutritional supplements and related goods, including beverages, energy drinks, and fitness beverages. The company is also asking for punitive damages and injunctive relief, including the destruction of all products and promotional materials containing the REIGN trademark.

Monster and VPX share a contentious history of litigation and recrimination, with multiple suits filed against each other spanning over a decade. Monster most recently filed suit against VPX in September 2018 in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.",VPX Sports Suit Threatens to 'Reign' In Monster Product

Against the backdrop of ,2019-03-29,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/29140302/Cola_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/wells-fargo-coke-energy-launch-suggests-confidence-in-monster-arbitration,"Against the backdrop of ongoing U.S. arbitration with Monster Energy, The Coca-Cola Company shared details of its plans to launch a new natural energy drink in Europe next month.

Coca-Cola Energy will debut in Spain and Hungary in April in 250 ml cans, according to a statement on Coke’s website. The product will have “a great Coca-Cola taste and feeling that people will know and love,” and contain natural caffeine (80 mg), guarana extracts and B vitamins.

In a Q&A posted to Coke’s website, Javier Meza, global CMO of sparkling beverages, cited energy as “one of the fastest-growing categories in our industry.”

“Coca-Cola Energy was developed by listening to what people told us they want from a Coca-Cola Energy drink,” Meza said. “It has a great Coca-Cola taste that people know and love, along with caffeine from naturally-derived sources. Coca-Cola Energy gives people an option to have an energy drink that fits their specific lifestyles and preferences.”

However, the launch of a new energy drink under the Coca-Cola mark, first announced in November 2018, has threatened to destabilize the soda giant’s relationship with one of its critical partners in the energy category, Monster. The two companies are currently engaged in arbitration proceedings to resolve a dispute over the interpretation of terms in their 2015 agreement which prevents Coke from launching a product that will directly compete with Monster.

Coke is the largest shareholder in Monster, owning a 16.7 percent stake in the company. The beverage giant also control two seats on the company board. As part of Coke’s nationwide refranchising of its bottling partners, Monster has gradually moved from DSD distributors to Coke partners over the last several years. Following its departure from Kalil Bottling Group in the Southwest earlier this month, New York-based Big Geyser is the only remaining independent distributor for Monster in North America.

According to Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog, Coke’s intention to move forward with the launch of Coca-Cola Energy in Europe, despite the fact that arbitration proceedings have not concluded, indicates that Coke “is increasingly confident that it will prevail.”

Coupled with a downbeat company forecast earlier this month, Herzog said Wells Fargo views the announcement as more negative news for Monster and a sign that “risks are increasing for Market-Perform rated MNST from multiple vantage points.” She noted the group’s outlook on the stock remains “cautious.”

In terms of Coke’s innovation, Herzog wrote that, despite the potential for Energy to cannibalize some of the company’s other SKUs, she expects “sales of Coca-Cola Energy to be accretive to KO’s total beverage share in Europe (and beyond…).”

The news of Coca-Cola Energy’s European launch is the second dose of bad news for Monster this week, following yesterday’s announcement of a new trademark infringement lawsuit from rival VPX Sports, makers of Bang Energy.

Indeed, Meza said Coke plans to introduce the product into other markets in the future.

“We plan to introduce Coca-Cola Energy in additional countries through 2019 and 2020,” Meza wrote. “We will confirm plans and timings if a decision is made to launch this new brand in a certain market.”",Wells Fargo: Coke Energy Launch Suggests 'Confidence' in Monster Arbitration

Following a rebrand of the core Reed’s line, which debuted at Natural Products Expo West 2019 earlier this month, Stalowir said the company is now looking to add new outlets and improve sales velocity. The company is aiming to expansion distribution “across existing and new channels supported by investment in new brokers, distributors, sales resources, and merchandisers,” he said.

According to Stalowir, Reed’s — funded by $16.2 million raised from an underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock — will increase trade spending and slotting for retail doors with an eye on adding between 5,000 to 10,000 new locations this year, of which 3,000 have already been confirmed. The new accounts include an 1,100 store expansion with Walmart nationwide rolling out next month. The company has also partnered with UNFI to distribute its complete Reed’s line and have expanded in retailers including Price Chopper, Safeway, Circle K, and Costco.

“We’re increasing our trade investment, including upgraded and increased displays, promotions, coupons, point-of-sale, and sampling, which now also include the dedicated team and Reed’s vehicle traveling to various events across the West Coast throughout 2019,” Stalowir said. “Each of these investments are designed to drive accelerated sales and build brand awareness and trial.”

Reed’s reported 10 percent revenue growth last year, led by a 33 percent increase in sales of its Virgil’s line. The company finished 2018 with a 28 percent gross margin for the fourth quarter and full year. The brand reported fourth quarter net sales of $9.6 million. For the full year, net sales grew 1 percent while core brand growth sales grew 8 percent, according to CFO Iris Snyder.

Stalowir said the company now plans to leverage the ketogenic diet trend to further boost sales of its Virgil’s Zero Sugar line. The company will promote the brand by calling out its all natural ingredient label with the slogan “Soda Smarter.” The campaign includes digital and print advertising, social media, trade investment, couponing, promotions, and sampling.

Marketing for the core Reed’s line will focus on the brand’s use of real ginger, with Stalowir noting plans to capitalize on recent negative media attention against competitors like Canada Dry, which was hit with a class action lawsuit last year alleging the product contained less than two parts per million of ginger despite its “Made from Real Ginger” slogan.

“We’re excited to have developed these compelling consumer campaigns and we now have the capital to launch them into the market in a meaningful way for the first time in the company’s history,” Stalowir said.",Reed's: Growth Plans Outlined in Q4 and Full Year Earnings
Kombucha brand Health-Ade and Whole Foods Market have reached a settlement to conclude a class action lawsuit ,2019-03-19,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/19130606/WholeFoods_HealthAde_fullwidth.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/health-ade-whole-foods-reach-4m-settlement-in-class-action-suit,"Kombucha brand Health-Ade and Whole Foods Market have reached a settlement to conclude a class action lawsuit filed last year by customers who alleged the company’s beverage products were mislabeled as non-alcoholic.

According to a motion filed on Friday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Health-Ade and Whole Foods are seeking to settle all claims for approximately $4 million ($3,997,500), including settlement administration, incentive awards, and attorneys’ fees and expenses.

In the complaint, originally filed last March and amended in May, the plaintiffs, Gabriela Bayol and Bruce Verbeck, alleged that Health-Ade Kombucha “has passed off its entire line of… beverages as non-alcoholic, when, in fact, the beverages contain more than twice the alcohol allowed for non-alcoholic beverages.” The complaint also stated that sugar levels have been understated in order to position the products as healthy alternatives to alcohol, while contributing to the continued fermentation of the drink in store coolers.

The suit claimed Whole Foods “materially contributes, controls and abets the fraud and misleading advertising” by placing the drink on shelves next to non-alcoholic beverages. The natural retailer was also part of a similar 2017 class action suit alongside GT’s Living Foods (formerly Millennium Products Inc.) that resulted in an $8.25 million settlement.

However, Whole Foods has no obligation to contribute any funds to the total financial settlement in the Health-Ade case, according to court documents.

According to the terms of the settlement, individual class members will be eligible to receive a cash payment of $4 for each product purchased during the class period without proof of purchase, up to $40 in total. Class members with proof of purchase can receive up to $80 in cash. According to the plaintiffs’ attorneys, the weighted average retail price of Health-Ade kombucha throughout the class period is $3.83.

The settlement also requires Health-Ade to add a warning to its package labels stating: “Kombucha should not be consumed if left unrefrigerated for an extended period of time. Pregnant/breast feeding? Consult your doctor. Due to natural fermentation, there may be trace amounts of alcohol and small pieces of culture.”

The company also agreed to “effectuate a formulation change” to control variability of alcohol and sugar content, and to regularly test its products using a third-party laboratory to ensure compliance.

Bayol and Verbeck will also each receive a $2,000 incentive award.

According to court documents, plaintiffs in the case deposed a representative of Health-Ade on a range of subjects, including alcohol and sugar content, beverage formulation, and the company’s financial health. The plaintiffs also commissioned independent lab tests for sugar and alcohol, and interviewed a Health-Ade distributor regarding potential issues related to refrigeration and cold-chain transportation.

Representatives for Whole Foods did not respond to a request for comment.

The Texas-based whiskey company finished 2018 delivering more than 30,000 cases and driving over 5,000 points of distribution across 12 states, and it does not look like the brand will be slowing down anytime soon.

The Devils River Whiskey ownership group is looking to expand distribution across the entire country. “Our goal is to be in more than 30 states by the end of 2019,” said Devils RiverWhiskey’s President and co-founder Mike Cameron. “Leading the aggressive expansion plan requires a strong team,” said Cameron. “We’re assembling a great group of the right men and women to get this done. We have divided the country into five regions and are proud of the talent that we’re bringing together to drive our market expansion.”

Industry veteran John Potts recently joined the Devils River Whiskey leadership team as the executive VP of sales and marketing. Potts is a Texas native with a strong track record of recruiting, building and leading national sales teams. He was one of the original members of the Deep Eddy Vodka team and was instrumental in leading the brand from launch through its eventual sale to Heaven Hill. Prior to leading the Deep Eddy team, Potts held multiple leadership roles at Republic National Distributing Company. “I’m thrilled to be leading sales and marketing for this ambitious undertaking,” said Potts.

Senior VP of marketing, Eric Hundelt, was one of the first employees hired by Devils River Whiskey and is continuing to drive the Devils River Whiskey’s marketing efforts across the country. Prior to joining Devils River Whiskey, Hundelt held a variety of senior level sales and marketing roles with brands like Angels Envy, Bacardi and Cabo Wabo tequila. The sales team will be divided into five regions. Matt Thornton was hired as regional VP of the Texas region. Brendon Walsh will serve as regional VP of the northeast region. Rick Perez will lead sales in the south as the regional VP of the southeast region. The company will be announcing appointments for the midwest and west regions in the very near future.

In anticipation for the expected growth, the company will be opening its San Antonio based distillery in October 2019. “We are in the processes of renovating the first two floors of the Burns building located at 401 E Houston Street. Built in 1918, the Burns building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. “We are excited to be part of San Antonio’s downtown revitalization as our distillery and visitor’s center will be in the heart of downtown San Antonio, blocks from the Alamo,” said Cameron.

Devils River Whiskey is extremely proud of its award-winning portfolio. 90-proof Devils River Bourbon launched in 2017 and was followed by the release of two new expressions, 90-proof Devils River Rye and 117-proof Devils River Barrel Strength Bourbon. Over the last 18 months the Devils River Whiskey brands have been awarded 22 medals of which nine were gold, one double gold and its rye was awarded Rye of the Year. “Our whiskies have been recognized as one of the best whiskies aged less than ten years according to some of the most prestigious whiskey competitions,” said Hundelt. “We’re primed for success and ready to share Devils River Whiskey with even more of the country.”

In November, the Santa Cruz, Calif.-based roaster and retailer changed its process to “Flash Brew,” in which coffee is brewed hot in an oxygen-free environment before being flash-chilled and infused with nitrogen. Flash brewing has replaced traditional cold brewing across the brand’s cafe, wholesale and keg operations, and has also provided it with a launchpad into the growing ready-to-drink coffee market: Verve’s flash brew is currently available in a single SKU in 9.5 oz. cans.

Speaking with BevNET managing editor Martin Caballero at Natural Products Expo West 2019, Verve co-founder Colby Barr discussed why he believes flash brew can help the company disrupt the crowded RTD coffee category and explained how it will create a strong brand identity around the concept. He also spoke about how Verve’s cafes help fuel its RTD innovations, which include the launch of single origin and decaffeinated SKUs, as well as experiments in blending with plant-based milks.",Expo West 2019: Verve Coffee Moves 'Flash' Forward

Complementing the partnership, Theobald & Oppenheimer announced a new hire, Kyle Harder, as brand director.

The rum, which is sourced from the Caribbean and blended with real coconut water, launched in the Pennsylvania market in April 2018. In less than a year, the brand experienced a tremendous response from consumers and industry professionals alike. The brand is now available in 500+ on and off-premise retailers throughout the state, including the Greater Philadelphia area, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh.

Single Prop Rum was introduced to the New York market in December of 2018, and is available for purchase at multiple retailers including Ninth Avenue Wine & Liquors and Goodfellas Wines & Spirits, and numerous popular bars and restaurants, including Sweetwater Social in NoHo, Alejandro’s Tapas Bar in Queens and Campania Coal-Fired Pizza locations throughout the city.

As of March 1, LNJ is the official distribution partner for Single Prop Rum, expanding the brand’s New York presence significantly. In addition to Single Prop, LNJ currently distributes a robust portfolio of premium wine and spirits brands throughout the entire state of New York with a focus in the metropolitan area.

Leading market growth efforts, Kyle Harder has been appointed as brand director of the Theobald & Oppenheimer brand portfolio. Harder earned his Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Michigan, during which time he also worked at the leading global spirits supplier Diageo on the innovation team, which included work on The Naked Turtle Rum brand.

Following his work with Diageo, Harder spent two years as associate brand manager at Deutsch Family Wine & Spirits, and most recently dedicated four years as brand manager and senior brand manager at Proximo Spirits, where he managed 1800 Tequila and 1800 The Ultimate Margarita, helping 1800 Tequila to achieve “Blue Chip” brand status by Shanken News and launching the “Just Refined Enough” brand campaign.

“I look forward to working with the company’s ownership team to continue building the already great brand portfolio and launching new innovative growth brands,” explained Harder. “Each brand within the portfolio embodies the entrepreneurial spirit of a startup, yet operates with the same ambition as our larger competitors. Single Prop Rum has an extremely unique, and real, brand story that is resonating with environmentally-conscious millennial consumers.”

Inspired by a journey island hopping through the Caribbean in a small single prop airplane, Single Prop Rum was born. A nod to the Caribbean tradition of slicing open fresh coconuts and pouring in locally made rum, Single Prop Rum sources unaged, virgin rum directly from the Caribbean and brings it to proof with USDA certified organic coconut water. In each sip, the coconut water creates a smooth, silky mouthfeel followed by a traditional warmth and sweetness common in a light rum, ending with subtle notes of banana and sugar apple.

In addition to Single Prop Rum, Theobald & Oppenheimer portfolio produces Faber Spirits, a line of simple, easy-drinking spirits sold throughout Pennsylvania. Theobald & Oppenheimer is also planning a third innovative product launch in late 2019.

Single Prop encourages the world to “Journey Responsibly,” and join Single Prop in its mission to appreciate and preserve the world’s wonders through environmentally conscious drinking habits, such as the use of paper biodegradable straws over single-use plastic ones. “Journey Responsibly” also embodies an emphasis on responsible alcohol consumption.

Established in 2012, Theobald & Oppenheimer (T&O) is a tribute to an era come and gone. T&O began the old-fashioned way: delivering spirits to bars by hand, something that had not been done in T&O’s home state, Pennsylvania, since before prohibition. T&O is in a building that at its peak, prided itself on using tried and true techniques to make high quality cigars under a variety of different brand names. Over a century later, T&O is carrying on the tradition that first occupied the space by curating a collection of spirits brands united by the same commitment to authenticity, craftsmanship and ingenuity. Spirits included in the Theobald & Oppenheimer portfolio include Single Prop Rum and FABER Spirits.","Theobald & Oppenheimer Launches Brand Partnership with LNJ Brands, Hires Brand Director"

Although the local economy had been driven by the lumber industry for over a century, Bend has in recent years seen an influx of innovative companies — from tech to food and beverage — launched within its borders. According the office of Oregon’s Secretary of State, Bend registers more new businesses each year than any other city in the state.

Entrepreneurs often point to the Bend lifestyle, which is steeped in outdoor sports, snow activities and craft beer, as part of the city’s appeal and why a variety of business and consumer publications have ranked Bend as one of the best small cities to live and work in the U.S.

In a recent visit to Bend, we met with a few of its food and beverage entrepreneurs and community leaders to learn more about the reasons behind its emergence as a business capital on the West Coast.

Tretap, which was acquired by Vermont’s original CBD store, Ceres Natural Remedies, in February, officially began selling the first CBD beverage flavor, Tangerine-Turmeric, in all Ceres stores across the state.

“This is a special day for all of us at Ceres Natural Remedies and Tretap. It highlights the collaboration of two Vermont wellness brands focused on consumer choice and access to quality products that benefit the body,” said Aaron Harris, director of sales and distribution for Ceres and Tretap founder.

Tretap is made in Vermont by seventh generation family maple growers. The low calorie, sparkling alternative to soda is naturally sweetened with a touch of anti-oxidant rich, organic maple syrup. 100 percent of the water contained in TreTap beverages is harvested using sustainable forestry practices and infused with organic flavors.

The new beverage line’s flavor profiles are based on the concept of “companion botanicals.” Such formulations are a marriage of broad-appeal fruits and complimentary herbs and flowers.

“At the core of our mission at Ceres, is the drive to introduce consumers to the power of plants, not simply hemp or cannabis, but the complete herbal apothecary that surrounds us and supports us in our health and wellness goals. The most effective way to incorporate these plant allies into our daily lifestyle is to include them in our diet. Adding these herbs and flowers into this line of Tretap beverages as a flavor component is a reminder to do just that,” said Bridget Conry, director of marketing for Ceres and Tretap.

Single 11.5 oz. cans of CBD infused Tangerine-Turmeric Tretap contain 25 mg. of hemp derived CBD and retail for $5.99 USD. They are available at the flagship Ceres Natural Remedies location in downtown Burlington as well as locations in Middlebury and Brattleboro.

Tretap Asks for Public Help to Choose Next Flavor

Part of what drives both Ceres and Tretap is its connection to customers. That’s why it is launching an online contest to create the next CBD infused flavor profile. Starting March 18, customers are invited to cast a vote for their favorite flavor by visiting the Ceres or Tretap Facebook pages or by navigating to surveymonkey.com/r/Q3523NQ. The contest will conclude at noon EST on April 1, 2019.

The flavor profile with the most votes will be announced in April and one voter at random will be chosen to receive a year’s supply of Tretap beverages along with a selection of Ceres Natural Remedies products.

Ceres Natural Remedies is one of Vermont’s most successful retailers and distributors of hemp derived CBD products. Offering New England’s largest selection of CBD products for plant-based health and wellness, CNR offers over 50 brands of extracts, capsules, edibles, pet and body care products made from hemp.

At the heart and soul of the company are two of Vermont’s largest maple farming families who harvest the maple sap that is the backbone of Tretap’s organic natural history. Its mission is to provide consumers with organic, sustainable and great tasting beverages that also help generate revenue for local Vermont Maple Farming Families.

Research shows that a polyphenol called resveratrol, found in red wine, reduces inflammation, provides cardiovascular benefits and has anti-aging properties. These benefits are offset by the damaging effects of excessive alcohol consumption, as reported in a recent study published in The Lancet. Beverage innovator Napa Hills has a refreshing solution, and is launching the world’s first sparkling waters that deliver the antioxidants of red wine, without alcohol, sugar or calories.

Napa Hills has been gathering attention since the debut of its first ‘vineyard enriched’ waters in 2017. In Anaheim this week for the 2019 Natural Foods Expo West, the company will add some sparkle to the functional beverage category.

“The response to our original heart-healthy waters has been fantastic. Consumers have also been asking for a sparkling version to accompany meals and entertaining,” said Napa Hills founder Ellona Jarvis. “Our new naturally flavored sparkling waters are fortified with red wine’s antioxidants. They’re delicious, unsweetened, and preservative free.”

Packaged in 375ml and 750ml glass bottles, Napa Hills Sparkling Waters will be available in the brand’s signature Cherry Rosé, Peach Grigio, Lemon Chardonnay and Pinot Berry flavors.

“Our new sparkling waters make a beautiful and refreshing addition to any table,” said Jarvis. “They also provide restaurants with a sophisticated hydration alternative. Each of our fruit flavors is designed to pair well with your favorite foods.” Sugar free Napa Hills is Paleo, Keto and kid-friendly.

Growing up in one of the world’s oldest winemaking regions, Jarvis was intrigued by the healthy components of wine, and determined to deliver them without alcohol. She spent four years working with bio-science, winemaking and beverage-production experts in the U.S. to develop VitaRes, the revolutionary bio-available antioxidant blend in Napa Hills Water. In addition to red wine extract and grape skin extract, VitaRes contains resveratrol, the naturally-occurring antioxidant in red wine which has been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory, anti-aging and cardiovascular benefits. A serving of Napa Hills Sparkling Water delivers more than 10 times the resveratrol found in a glass of red wine. Napa Hills Waters are the world’s first ‘vineyard enriched’ water beverages. Napa Hills uses sustainably-sourced ingredients and provides an upcycling path for the by-products and environmental impact of the winemaking industry.",Napa Hills Launches Sparkling Water with Red Wine Antioxidants

With a focus on taste and quality that pioneered the premium mixer category and helped lead the renaissance of tonic, Fever-Tree is set to once again bring about a liquid paradigm shift.

Fever-Tree’s new ginger range exemplifies the same expertise that created its game-changing specialty tonics and perfectly complements all spirits, including gin, mezcal, vodka, whiskey, rum, brandy, as well as liqueurs and vermouths. The expressions will be available nationwide in some of the world’s most iconic bar and restaurant venues, including Bar Sardine, PDT, Saxon + Parole and RedFarm in New York City and The Anderson in Miami. It will also be sold at select specialty retailers, as well as on ReserveBar.com (SRP $5.99/200 ml 4-pack) in Spring 2019.

Like the existing ginger expressions, Smoky Ginger Ale, Spiced Orange Ginger Ale and Refreshingly Light Ginger Ale have been expertly created using a unique blend of Fever-Tree’s three signature gingers. Sourced from Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Cochin (India), the variety of gingers add an incredible freshness and aroma required to complement the large variation of flavors found in the finest spirits.

Adds smoked applewood and subtle citrus to the signature ginger blend. Through PureSmoke technology, applewood water imparts a delicate, complex sweetness. Certified Non-GMO, Fever-Tree Smoky Ginger Ale incorporates naturally-sourced ingredients with no artificial sweeteners. The unique mixer complements the complex flavor notes of a variety of whiskey and rum styles, while bringing a dynamic twist to any drink.

This expression combines ginger, citrus from cold-pressed South African clementines and spice from Sri Lankan steam-distilled cinnamon. Certified Non-GMO, Fever-Tree Spice Orange Ginger Ale is gluten-free and incorporates naturally-sourced ingredients with no artificial sweeteners. It has been crafted to complement the rich, full-bodied flavors found in the finest aged spirits, in particular Cognacs and rums, while delightfully refreshing when paired with an apéritif-style liquor.

Reducing calories by 47 percent without compromising on taste, Fever-Tree blends fruit sugars with the same gingers used in the brand’s regular range to provide consumers with the greatest possible choices. This is the third expression of the Refreshingly Light line, joining lighter versions of Fever-Tree Ginger Beer and Fever-Tree Indian Tonic.

To round out the launch, Fever-Tree concurrently unveils its Fever-Tree Ginger Pairing Wheel inspired by the company’s groundbreaking pairing wheel for its range of tonics. The new wheel skillfully navigates through the nuances of flavors and dynamism of a wide array of premium spirits pairings. It will serve as creative in a new national campaign and will be available online for reference.

Fever-Tree USA CEO Charles Gibb said: “We see enormous opportunity for the Fever-Tree ginger range. Ginger ale represents more than half of the mixer category and is a $1.1 billion market. Moreover, our selection of three different gingers from three diverse regions ensures that we deliver an authentic, dynamic and real ginger taste on the palate.”

“Our ginger expressions pair exceptionally well with whisk(e)y, as well as other aged spirits, such as Cognac, brandy and rum. These exciting and dynamic spirits categories are enjoying fantastic growth. They deserve the right mixer to complement their diverse flavor profiles, because ‘If 3/4 of your drink is the mixer, mix with the best.’ After all, the craftsmanship of an exceptional spirit deserves the most delicious mixer!”

Fever-Tree USA marketing director Amanda Stackman said: “Fever-Tree revolutionized the tonic category by largely focusing on gin, which accounts for only 6% of spirits sales. With dark spirits now accounting for 60% of premium sales, we see unlimited potential for our gingers to really have an outsized impact.”

Founded in 2005, Fever-Tree is the leading premium line of carbonated mixers. It procures the world’s finest ingredients from natural sources, including quinine from the Democratic Republic of Congo, ginger from Ivory Coast, India and Nigeria and lemons from the slopes of Mount Etna, Sicily. The Fever-Tree range is designed to complement and enhance a wide array of premium spirits and with its high quality and naturally sourced ingredients is the perfect accompaniment to any drinking occasion. Unlike most mixers on the market today, which contain high fructose corn syrup, saccharin or aspartame, Fever-Tree products contain no artificial sweeteners or flavorings, restoring taste and quality to the category. Since its launch, Fever-Tree has collected a vast number of awards, including the Best Selling & Top Trending Tonic Water for five consecutive years by Drinks International’s surveys of the World’s Best Bars. In the U.S., Fever-Tree’s portfolio includes 15 mixers, comprising tonics, ginger ales and ginger beers that are available at leading retailers, bars and restaurants across the country.

Bang is now available in 12 unique flavors like Sour Heads and Purple Haze throughout the Capital Region.

“Bang is not your typical high-sugar, health-robbing beverage. Rather, Bang consists of several patent-pending compounds and patented compositions intelligently designed to deliver results without the sugar-induced metabolic mayhem and crash,” explained Jack Owoc, CEO and chief science officer of VPX Sports.

Current commercially available energy drinks use high levels of sugar, which instantly boost your insulin levels. When the caffeine and sugar leaves your body, your hormone levels normalize, which causes the fatigue known as the “crash.” Bang incorporates creatine, glutamine and other amino acids including BCAA’s (branched-chain amino acids) that provide both immediate and long-term energy without the crash. Bang goes above and beyond the expectations of typical short-term energy beverages in this category.

Bang contains 300 mg of caffeine, 0 sugar, 0 carbs and 0 calories. It’s ideal for gamers, fitness enthusiasts, athletes, extreme sports, CrossFit and as a pre-workout for bodybuilders or anyone desiring a delicious-tasting carbonated beverage that doesn’t contain sugar. BANG provides clean energy, laser-sharp focus and no sugar-induced crashes.

“The beverage innovators at VPX Sports have redefined the energy drink category with this well-researched and effective energy drink,” said DDC general manager, Russ Teplitzky. “Bang tastes incredible and I can’t wait for consumers to try it!”

The growth of Bang has been phenomenal because of its powerful global social marketing appeal. The energy drink currently has more than 92 million social media followers fueled by a super progressive concert-style global experiential marketing campaign called The Bang Revolution World Tour.

We understand that our customers are looking for a variety of better-for-you beverages and Revive is exactly the functional beverage our customers are demanding.”

More and more consumers are discovering kombucha’s benefits, from improving gut health to immune system support and so much more. However, not all kombucha is created equal. Revive’s ability to create a great tasting plus functional beverage makes its appeal much broader. Made with all organic ingredients and traditionally fermented live cultures, Revive kombucha is brewed like a craft beer resulting in smooth, refreshing and lightly effervescent kombucha without a harsh vinegary bite. Revive develops all of their own recipes, techniques and cultures to create their unique brews which are always non-alcoholic and low in calories, sugar and carbs.

The three super tasty Revive Kombucha flavors now available in 7-Eleven stores across the U.S. in 12 oz. bottles include:
• Original Cola: Revive’s OG flavor, this is the brew that changed everything. Original Cola is the foundation, the first brew and represents the flavor of Revive Kombucha. This crisp and smooth black tea brew features a hint of vanilla to leave you feeling refreshed, guilt-free and ready for fun.
• Hibiscus Refresher: A brew that reminds you of those effortless moments when you’re in the groove. Together, the naturally sweet and tart hibiscus flowers awaken with this unique caffeine-free kombucha culture, making for a bright, laid-back, feel-good brew.
• Ginger Lime: This never-before-charted brew uses cold-pressed ginger – instead of tea – to ferment the kombucha culture. This caffeine-free trailblazer, emboldened with fresh, tart time, will knock the dust off your boots.

“7-Eleven has always been a destination for soda. As a guy who grew up in the Midwest with a bad soda habit, I’ll never forget the first time my wife handed me a bottle of kombucha to try. At first, I nearly spit it out but then my body began to crave it. I began to quickly feel and see the functional benefits of drinking kombucha. I knew though that there had to be a way to create a super tasty, craveable kombucha that even my own friends and family would drink – and perhaps even replace their soda habits like I did. I was then on a mission to create the best tasting kombucha possible – and it is no accident that our ‘Original Cola’ was our first brew that really defined our foundation of our flavor innovation and naturally fermented brews,” said Sean J. Lovett, founder and president of Revive Kombucha. “We are thrilled about this new relationship with 7-Eleven. It is the perfect way to expand the kombucha category to a much larger consumer base, which will transform the overall consumption of kombucha in the long-term.”

Kombucha sales in the convenience channel are relatively small at $14.8MM (representing 3.2 percent share of Total Kombucha in the U.S.) yet growing at 35 percent year after year.

Revive Kombucha is a culture-driven, craft kombucha brewery launched at the Sonoma County Farmers Market in 2010 and located in Petaluma, California. Their mission has always been to sustainably produce the best tasting kombucha using the highest quality ingredients and most innovative craft brewing techniques: from their vertically integrated brewery, to being the first to market with brewing innovations (hibiscus and ginger caffeine free brews, and other non-tea brews with coffee, yerba mate and cacao) in their product line. Revive works as hard to take care of the people and world around them as they do in brewing their kombucha. This shows in their sustainability initiatives—from their early efforts with bio-diesel delivery and award-winning Bottle Exchange program, to their current efforts with water reclamation and conservation in the brew process, and always offering living-wages and above standard benefits to employees.

"— Ice Age Glacial, an ultra-pure water sourced from ancient glaciers within the Coast Mountains of British Columbia, has debuted in select U.S. markets, in addition to its existing distribution in Canada.",2019-03-21,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/21153327/a4b3c034b0493b4ec2c6-480x320.png,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/ice-age-glacial-expands-from-canada-to-the-u-s,"TOBA INLET, British Columbia— Ice Age Glacial, an ultra-pure water sourced from ancient glaciers within the Coast Mountains of British Columbia, has debuted in select U.S. markets, in addition to its existing distribution in Canada.

What sets Ice Age Glacial apart from spring water is its purity, smoothness and low mineral content — with the lowest amount of total dissolved solids (4 PPM) out of any bottled water in the marketplace. Ice Age Glacial water is nitrate-free, sodium-free and chlorine-free.

1.6 million years ago during the beginning of the last Ice Age, vast parts of Canada were covered by glaciers. Today, despite that the last Ice Age ended nearly 10,000 years ago, many mountains still rise to heavily glaciated peaks across Canada, including the largest temperature-latitude ice fields in the world. Pure glacial water sources are very rare. 200 kilometers Northwest of Vancouver in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia, the ancient ice fields of the Toba Inlet form the source of Ice Age Glacial water. Natural glacial water of unmatched purity is collected as it naturally melts and flows from the edges of the towering and ancient glaciers in the Toba Inlet deep in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia; land protected by government and secluded in nature, shielded from civilization and industry. As the water falls, it is collected, which results in naturally pure glacial water with a low mineral content, yet still containing rare minerals only found in ancient glaciers.

Capturing the water before it falls into the ocean allows consumers to enjoy the pure glacial taste without disrupting the water table. Ice Age’s natural glacial water is then transported to a nearby zero waste, cutting-edge bottling facility that follows the strict guidelines of both Health Canada and the FDA.

Ice Age Glacial is available in two different varieties. Its signature is an ultra-pure still water, bottled for a taste of a world untouched since the last Ice Age. The other variety is Ice Age 9.5 (pH), a premium high alkaline glacial water infused with minerals and electrolytes, made to enhance hydration and replenishment. Both varieties of Ice Age Glacial are now available in BPA Free Plastic (350ml, 500ml, 750ml and 1L). Ice Age is available on shelves in health food and grocery stores in select markets across North America and nationwide on Amazon.com.

Wells Fargo securities analysts expressed growing concern that dragging volumes and competitive pressure from an ascendant rival are starting to take their toll on Monster Beverage Corp.,2019-03-21,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/21154010/Monster-Energy_Full-Width_1.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/wells-fargo-competition-volume-drops-hurting-monster,"Wells Fargo securities analysts expressed growing concern that dragging volumes and competitive pressure from an ascendant rival are starting to take their toll on Monster Beverage Corp.

In a “data deep dive” released on Tuesday, Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog raised a number of challenges currently facing Monster, ranging from questions over pricing strategy to speculation around the future of its relationship with distribution partner The Coca-Cola Company. The report also highlighted how the company has been ceding market share to Bang, the fitness-oriented energy drink brand with which Monster has a history of contentious litigation.

Herzog cited declining U.S. sales dollars and volume growth over the last several weeks as causes for alarm at Monster. According to Nielsen all-channel data for the period ended Mar. 9, dollar sales for Monster Energy drinks were up 6 percent over the last 12 weeks, but down 1.6 percent over the last four weeks and down 3.4 percent for the last week.

Meanwhile, average price increased 6.3 percent over the last four weeks while volume fell 7.4 percent during that time. Over the last week of the period ending Mar. 9, average price increased 6.1 percent while volume fell 8.9 percent.

Overall energy category sales were up 11.5 percent over the last 12 weeks and 7.1 percent over the last four weeks. Volume decreased 7.4 percent over the last four weeks and 0.9 percent for the 12 weeks.

“We think the set-up for Monster remains tough, and [Tuesday’s] Nielsen data only amplifies our concerns about Monster’s recent pricing actions and new competitive threats,” Herzog wrote.

Monster is also feeling the pressure from Bang, according to Herzog. She cited the upstart performance energy brand as accounting for over 100 percent of total energy category volume growth over the last one week and four week periods. Over a 52-week period ended Mar. 9, the brand has achieved retail sales of $403 million, according to Nielsen data.

While asking if “Bang could indeed be the Juul of the energy category,” Herzog suggested that because Bang’s channel penetration remains low — and because of retailer skepticism about Monster’s new release Reign, designed to compete directly with Bang — the upstart company has a long runway of growth opportunities.

Other potential issues highlighted by Herzog were ongoing negotiations between Coca-Cola and Monster over the former’s plan to release an energy drink and the potential for Monster to be acquired by PepsiCo.","Wells Fargo: Competition, Volume Drops Hurting Monster"

Since launching Brew Dr. Kombucha in 2008 from the kitchens of Townshend’s Teahouses, the brand has continued to innovate its kombucha-making process. Using a unique vacuum still, Brew Dr. Kombucha removes the alcohol from the fermented tea without the use of heat, preserving the beverage’s beneficial live and active cultures. All varieties use Townshend’s custom organic tea blends, herbs and botanicals, resulting in a smooth and balanced taste.

Townshend’s Tea Company was started by Matt Thomas in 2006 with the idea of serving great teas in a casual teahouse setting. Over the years, the effort of presenting the wide world of tea to their guests has expanded the Townshend’s collection to over 120 tea offerings, including classic teas, rare varieties, chai latte recipes made from scratch, Taiwanese bubble tea, and an herbal apothecary line. The company now operates nine teahouses in Oregon, Montana and Utah. In 2008, the company began making kombucha in the kitchens of their then two teahouses, giving it the name Brew Dr. Kombucha. It was only natural for them to choose some of the same great custom tea blends they had developed for service at their popular teahouses and ferment those into kombucha. It turns out that approach is unique, as most commercially available kombucha is flavored with juice at the time of bottling. Brew Dr. Kombucha’s flavor profiles come from attention to the quality and formulation of the organic tea and botanicals used, creating a difference you can taste.",Brew Dr. Kombucha Launches Power Flower Flavor

With remarkable momentum and a rapidly expanding distribution, KILL CLIFF is on a march to $1 million. Led by a former Navy SEAL, the company has committed to donating $1 million to the Navy SEAL Foundation by the end of 2019.

Former Navy SEAL Todd Ehrlich created and built KILL CLIFF with the singular goal of giving back to his community. Long before he took a paycheck, the founder began making donations to the Navy SEAL Foundation and made it his goal to become the largest single contributor. KILL CLIFF has been an Official Partner of the Navy SEAL Foundation since 2015 and to-date has raised and donated more than $731,000 in cash, event sponsorship and product equivalences. Learn more about the partnership in this video.

“Since day one, the driving force behind KILL CLIFF has been to give back to the SEAL community,” said John Timar, KILL CLIFF COO and former Navy SEAL. “The need to support the Naval Special Warfare community and their families is greater now than ever before. That need drives KILL CLIFF to grow so it can make an even bigger impact. We are working day and night to meet the goal of donating $1 million and then continue pushing well beyond that mark.”

The Navy SEAL Foundation provides immediate and ongoing support and assistance to the Naval Special Warfare community and its families in times of adversity and triumph.

"All channel sales for snacks and non-alcoholic beverages grew 5.1 percent during the four-week period ending Mar. 23, according to an analysis of Nielsen data by Wells Fargo Securities.",2019-04-2,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/27165452/Nielsen_Wells_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/nielsen-sparkling-waters-csds-spur-growth-in-march,"All channel sales for snacks and non-alcoholic beverages grew 5.1 percent during the four-week period ending Mar. 23, according to an analysis of Nielsen data by Wells Fargo Securities.

Total beverage sales for The Coca-Cola Company increased 2.9 percent to $18.4 billion, a slight uptick on momentum over the 12 week (2.4 percent) and 52 week periods (2.4 percent). The company enjoyed strong performance from its carbonated soft drink (CSD) portfolio, which grew 5.6 percent over the four-week period against an average price increase of 4.9 percent and 0.7 percent increase in volume. Sales of regular CSDs were up 6.4 percent, compared to 4.0 percent for low calorie sodas.

Elsewhere, sales of Coke’s bottled water products dipped 0.7 percent over the four week period, with volume dropping 2.2 percent and pricing up 1.6 percent. Sparkling and still flavored water sales also fell 1.1 percent, as did sports drinks, down 2.5 percent. However, the most dramatic downturns came in shelf-stable juices and coconut water. The former saw sales fall 15.2 percent and volumes decline 15.7 percent, while the latter recorded a 26.4 percent drop in sales over the four-week period (down 20.3 percent over 52 weeks).

PepsiCo enjoyed 2 percent growth in total beverage and snack sales during the four weeks. CSDs performed well for the company, up 1.5 percent in sales against 2.8 percent decline in volume. Yet water proved to be the main growth driver; sales of still flavored water increased 14.1 percent (volume grew 12.5 percent), while bottled water sales climbed 4 percent. Sparkling water performed even better, growing 108.8 percent over the four-week period and 459.9 percent over the 52-week period. Sparkling and still flavored water together are up 46.2 percent and represent over $500 million in retail sales for PepsiCo over the 52 weeks.

Sports drinks sales for PepsiCo also grew 0.8 percent, reversing a 2.1 percent decline over the 12-week period. However, the company’s energy drinks (including tea and coffee) fell 31.2 percent and refrigerated juices were down 4.4 percent.

Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) saw total beverage sales increase 1.9 percent. CSDs were up 3.8 percent over the four weeks, with volume dropping 4.2 percent and price increasing 8.3 percent during that time. While its rivals saw dollar sales drop in shelf-stable juices, KDP recorded a 2 percent increase in the category. The company’s bottled water portfolio, which now includes CORE, grew sales 5.2 percent in the period (up 16.9 percent for the 52-week period), as volume fell 10.8 percent and average price grew 17.9 percent. Liquid tea sales were up 1.7 percent, though only 0.3 percent over the 52-week period.

Elsewhere, KDP sales of sparkling flavored water (1.4 percent), sparkling juice (7.1 percent) and energy drinks (1.5 percent) were all down.

In the energy category, which saw dollar sales climb 8.1 percent, the story remains mostly the same: Monster is sliding, Bang is gaining, and Red Bull is maintaining a consistent growth trajectory. For Monster, total energy sales declined 2.6 percent over the four-week period, though they remain up 9.2 percent for the 52-week period. Volume fell 8.3 percent during the four weeks, while the average price rose 6.3 percent. Meanwhile, Bang sales grew 869.4 percent over the four weeks, matched by volume gains of 808.5 percent. The upstart brand, which launched another salvo in its ongoing legal battle with Monster, grew dollar share of the category 8.3 percent over the four weeks.

Meanwhile, Red Bull posted a dollar sales increase of 7.8 percent for the four-week period, against 8.6 percent growth in volume and 0.8 percent decline in average price. Rockstar energy sales continued to slide, though the company enjoyed 12.8 percent growth in coffee product sales.

From top level perspective, strong growth for sparkling flavored water — up 15.3 percent in dollar sales, 11.4 percent in volume over the four weeks — remains the big story. Along with Pepsi’s robust showing, Talking Rain also impressed, posting 18.4 percent growth in dollar sales for sparkling flavored water over the four weeks, with volume up 19.1 percent. Climbing sales for Nestle (21.8 percent) and Polar (22.6 percent) are helping power the category, but 10 percent uptick in sales for private label and 65.7 percent for all others (97.6 percent for 52 weeks) indicates there is still more ground to be gained in this $2.4 billion segment.

Wells Fargo managing director of equity research Bonnie Herzog wrote in a report that the bank was “impressed by still strong trends across the liquid coffee category,” noting a 7.2 percent increase in sales. Within the segment, Pepsi and Starbucks’ North American Coffee Partnership (NACP) charted ahead of Coke’s liquid coffee portfolio, growing 4.1 percent compared to 2.5 percent (though it is outpacing its rival 16.2 percent to 2.8 percent for the 52-week period). Herzog noted increased competition for NACP, which saw its dollar share for the category slide as Danone North America made gains.","Nielsen: Sparkling Waters, CSDs Spur Growth in March"
"If you follow marketing trends at all, then you don’t need to be told about the value of targeting the millennial demographic. But while many new beverage innovations are designed with the under-40 set in mind, older consumers have often been overlooked.",2019-04-2,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/02165234/Perennial_Full-Width_2.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/beyond-meat-co-founder-launches-plant-based-drink-for-50-demo,"If you follow marketing trends at all, then you don’t need to be told about the value of targeting the millennial demographic. But while many new beverage innovations are designed with the under-40 set in mind, older consumers have often been overlooked.

Perennial, a new plant-based beverage company, is seeking to tap into the sizable over-50 consumer base with a product designed to promote healthy aging. The Calif.-based brand, which launched online this week after three years in development, was created by Brent Taylor, co-founder of plant-based protein brand Beyond Meat, and food scientist Sara Bonham. Speaking with BevNET, Taylor and Bonham said that as more Americans live longer and remain active into their later years, there is space in the market for the modern adult consumer where the entrenched health and aging based beverages have failed to capitalize.

“When we first started on this hypothesis, everyone told us not to talk about age specifically,” Taylor told BevNET. “But we feel it’s really important to have age as a key identifier, because we believe that’s how we can best innovate for them and best design, on their behalf, progressive food and beverage products.”

Perennial is a nutritional beverage made with a blend of fiber, vitamins, and plant proteins and is formulated to aid in digestion, bone, and cognitive health. Each 8 oz carton contains 140 calories, 3 g of prebiotic fiber, 32 mg of Omega-3 DHA, and 8 g of protein. The product is available in 12-packs for $34.99 plus shipping or 24-packs for $69.99.

Currently only available through ecommerce, Bonham said the company does expect to branch into retail but has no immediate expansion plans. She noted that 39 percent of online purchases are made by consumers over 50 and that the base “spends an incredible amount of time on Facebook and social media outlets.” To promote the launch of Perennial, the company is launching a social media campaign featuring influencers over 50 “that are doing amazing things out in the world,” she said.

Taylor also suggested the brand has global potential, noting that today 8 percent of the world’s population is over 65, but that number is expected to grow 13 percent by 2030. Though there are similar nutritional beverages aimed at older consumers, such as Ensure and Boost, Perennial plays closer in branding and profile to a modern, plant-based functional drink.

“I think today, if were just talking about the U.S., the 50-plus demographic truly is a changed generation,” Taylor said. “They’re aging better than the generations before them and they continue to get better with age. So the challenge is in the grocery stores, in the mass market channel, there are no other food and beverage products that are truly championing them. We’re a brand that has their back on a day-to-day basis.”

Perennial has to date raised $2.5 million from investors including Collaborative Fund, Powerplant Ventures, SOSV, and family offices in the U.S. and Canada.

Collaborative Fund partner and Perennial board member Lauren Loktev told BevNET that the firm was interested in the brand because of the over-50 positioning as well as its innovative approach to the plant-based space. Collaborative Fund had previously invested in Beyond Meat, as well as other plant-based food and beverage brands including Impossible Foods and Ripple.

“We think there is a real opportunity to not only create an imitation of a dairy product, but something that is maybe as good or better than dairy, and the opportunity to create something from a health perspective that is superior by using plants,” Loktev said. “Perennial we really loved because I think the next wave of animal protein alternatives is going to need to have companies that have favorable health and nutrition profiles and can address needs that are harder to fulfill with the existing products that are out there.”",Former Beyond Meat Co-Founder Launches Plant-Based Drink for 50+ Demo
 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chief Scott Gottlieb today announced new steps towards clarifying and constructing a legal framework around cannabis and cannabis-derived products.,2019-04-2,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/02152035/FDA_Full-Width_1.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/fda-new-cannabis-enforcement-research-actions-announced,"Outgoing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chief Scott Gottlieb today announced new steps towards clarifying and constructing a legal framework around cannabis and cannabis-derived products.

In a letter posted on the FDA’s website, Gottlieb outlined a series of actions set to begin as early as next month, including the formation of an exploratory group examining CBD supplements and foods, and a public hearing for “stakeholders to share their experiences and challenges with these products.”

The public hearing, set for May 31, is aimed at helping the FDA gather feedback on existing regulatory strategy and potential changes that could improve predictability and efficiency. Written public comment will also be solicited.

None of the steps outlined in Gottlieb’s letter, however, changes the FDA’s current position prohibiting food with either CBD or THC from being introduced into interstate commerce or to be marketed as dietary supplements. The commissioner noted the actions were “consistent with the approach and commitments described” in a statement released following the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill in December.

“As part of the public hearing and related public comment period, the agency is interested in whether there are particular safety concerns that we should be aware of as we consider the FDA’s regulatory oversight and monitoring of these products,” Gottlieb wrote. “For example, we’re seeking comments, data and information on a variety of topics including: what levels of cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds cause safety concerns; how the mode of delivery (e.g., ingestion, absorption, inhalation) affects the safety of, and exposure to, these compounds; how cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds interact with other substances such as drug ingredients; and other questions outlined in the hearing announcement.”

Gottlieb wrote that the FDA is also seeking “incentives for, and the feasibility of, drug development with CBD and other cannabis-derived compounds would be affected if the commercial availability of products with these compounds, such as foods and dietary supplements, were to become significantly more widespread.” While the market is poised to expand, he also expressed his desire to avoid dissuading companies from pursuing research that could support FDA approval of new drugs and medical treatments.

“It’s important that we continue to assess whether there could be medical ramifications if patients choose to take CBD to treat certain diseases at levels higher or lower than studied in well-controlled clinical studies,” he wrote.

The high-level internal working group will be charged with considering “what options might be appropriate” for the agency based on current law, according to Gottlieb’s letter. The working group will be co-chaired by FDA principal commissioner Amy Abernethy, M.D., Ph.D. and principal associate commissioner for policy Lowell Schiller, and will begin sharing information with the public as early as this summer.

Finally, Gottlieb redoubled the FDA’s commitment to holding companies accountable for making unsubstantiated claims on cannabis and cannabis-derived products. The agency announced today it has issued warning letters to three companies for making claims on over a dozen products and on the Internet. According to Gottlieb, the companies — Advanced Spine and Pain LLC, Nutra Pure LLC and PotNetwork Holdings Inc. — used online platforms to make a number of unfounded claims related to their products’ ability to “limit, treat or cure cancer, neurodegenerative conditions, autoimmune diseases, opioid use disorder, and other serious diseases.”

“I believe these are egregious, over-the-line claims and we won’t tolerate this kind of deceptive marketing to vulnerable patients,” the commissioner wrote. “The FDA continues to be concerned about the proliferation of egregious medical claims being made about products asserting to contain CBD that haven’t been approved by the FDA, such as the products and companies receiving warning letters today.”","FDA: New Cannabis Enforcement, Research Actions Announced"

Both Wawa and Giant already carry 500ml and 1L product lines that have been high performers in the category.

“We are thrilled to welcome the new 1.5L bottle to our Waiakea product line,” said Waiakea CEO and founder, Ryan Emmons. “Our consumers asked for a larger bottle, and we listened. The 1.5L offers the same delicious hydration coupled with the unique sustainability platform Waiakea is known for, but at a better value, for our loyal Waiakea fanbase and new customers to enjoy.”

Like the other Waiakea bottles, the 1.5L bottle is made entirely from other post-recycled or upcycled bottles (RPET) and certified CarbonNeutral for this and other initiatives, including its sustainable sourcing, its shipping with low-emissions vehicles and its regional reforestation projects. For every liter purchased, Waiakea also donates a week’s supply of clean water to those in need.

Waiakea originates in Hawaii through both snowmelt and rain on the pristine peak of the active Mauna Loa volcano. It’s then filtered through thousands of feet of porous volcanic rock, enhancing it with minerals and electrolytes. Waiakea is naturally alkaline with a smooth mouthfeel and award-winning taste thanks to the unique combination of minerals such as silica, calcium and magnesium.

Through the end of March to early April, Waiakea will roll out the new 1.5L bottles to Wawa stores in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, and Giant stores across Pennsylvania.

Waiakea was founded in Hawai’i in 2012 as the first Hawaiian volcanic water and triple bottom line premium water of its kind, adapting an unparalleled platform of healthy, sustainable and ethical attributes and initiatives. Waiakea’s mission is to sustainably provide naturally healthy Hawaiian volcanic water with the blessing of indigenous Kapuna and Konohiki, while contributing to, and promoting, clean water access, conservation and education for those in need in Hawai’i and throughout the world. Waiakea’s landmark program, The Kokua Initiative, invests time and resources into local community projects and non-profits, focusing primarily on education, addiction and environmental stewardship in Hawaii. Additionally, for every liter bought, Waiakea donates a one-week supply of clean water to people in need in Malawi through its clean water projects in partnership with Pump Aid, which have already positively transformed the lives of thousands since 2012.

Along with its 100 percent upcycled bottles (rPET), low-emissions shipping and CarbonNeutral certification, Waiakea Water recently announced the eventual implementation of its simple carbon wax bottle that has only two percent of the material lifespan of regular plastic bottles, providing a solution for plastic waste throughout the world.",Waiakea Releases New 1.5L Bottles of Hawaiian Volcanic Water

Pioneers in the pursuit of perfection and craft, the new Absolut Elyx bottle continues to be a symbol of emboldened luxury, providing an even bolder shelf stand out that gives a stronger platform for brand storytelling.

Expertly brought to life by London-based design agency Stranger & Stranger, the new Absolut Elyx bottle boasts a timeless silhouette with opulent flare. Made from over 40 percent recycled glass, the design celebrates the vintage copper credentials central to the creation of Absolut Elyx, through a sleeker, lustrous and more elegant form that stands out from the crowd.

“With Absolut Elyx we always endeavor to challenge the normal conventions associated with luxury vodka to create a profile that is uniquely playful, luxurious and eclectic. We’re thrilled to have partnered with Stranger & Stranger, who truly understand our brand DNA and have produced a piece of art that captures the spirit of the Absolut Elyx lifestyle,” said Miranda Dickson, global brand director for Absolut Elyx.

“Our vision was to celebrate the special role copper plays in the distillation process in a way that lends well to the brand’s global reputation for elevated panache. The faceted bottle pays homage to the vintage copper column still from 1921 and gives the bottles a luminescent glimmer,” said Rowan Miller, design director at Stranger & Stranger.

While the Absolut Elyx bottle has evolved, the vodka remains unchanged. Available in more than 70 markets worldwide, Absolut Elyx is the luxury handcrafted expression of Absolut vodka. At 42.3 percent ABV, every drop of Absolut Elyx is made using wheat from one single estate in Åhus, Sweden, using the brand’s vintage copper still – every drop of Absolut Elyx is produced from seed to bottle within a 15-mile radius.

The new Absolut Elyx bottle is available worldwide in Spring/Summer 2019. Follow Absout Elyx on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter, and visit the Elyx Boutique.

Absolut Elyx is the handcrafted luxury expression of multi award-winning Absolut Vodka, built on a commitment to quality craftsmanship and a pioneering spirit. Every drop of Absolut Elyx is made with soft winter wheat from a single estate in Åhus, Sweden, manually distilled in a 1921 copper column, removing all impurities and resulting in the vodka’s exceptionally smooth finish. The entire production of Absolut Elyx takes place within a 15 mile radius and is overseen by master distiller Krister Asplund, who supervises the century-old distillation process that has been passed down through generations of Swedish vodka-makers. As the leading expression of luxury vodka made for today, Absolut Elyx is admired globally for its playful spirit and tradition of standing out from the crowd.

Honking and tooting its way through Port Ellen and eventually to Ardbeg, this typically Islay cavalcade of colour represents a long-standing love for festivity on the island.

Ardbeg Day will be held on Saturday, June 1, 2019. Inspired by Islay’s rich history of carnivals, Ardbeg will release Ardbeg Drum – a limited edition bottling imbued with the ultimate influence of carnival spirit, rum. In a first for the Distillery, Ardbeg have taken Ardbeg single malt from ex-Bourbon casks, and rested it awhile in ex-rum casks from the Americas to coax out tropical tastes.

Distillery manager Mickey Heads said: “The Ardbeg Day Carnival is about embracing all things tropical. From music and dance to food and fashion, we’re all set to revel in both culture and character. And we’re delighted to introduce Ardbeg Drum – a celebration of all of the mixed up, mashed up influences that make Ardbeg, Ardbeg. In Ardbeg Drum, a multitude of complex flavours parade across the palate – fragrant pine resin and woodsmoke dance alongside ripe banana and pineapple. Then lavender, liquorice and vanilla strut into a long, smoky finish. Preparations are well underway, but orchestrating a bash this breathtaking is no mean feat. The finer details are yet to be revealed, but rest assured, the Ardbeg Day Carnival 2019 will be a spectacle you won’t soon forget…”

Like all Ardbeg Days, the carnival crowds won’t just be gathering on Islay. Ardbeggians the world over will join in the rumbustious revelry as Ardbeg Drum is introduced in a flourish of confetti and streamers. Smoky malt lovers should remember that The Ardbeg Day Carnival is open to everybody, so feel free to grab some friends and enjoy the spectacle en masse.

Ardbeg prides itself on being The Ultimate Islay Malt Whisky. Established in 1815, Ardbeg is revered by connoisseurs around the world as among the peatiest, smokiest and most complex of all the Islay malts. Despite its smokiness, Ardbeg is renowned for its delicious sweetness, a phenomenon that has affectionately become known as “the peaty paradox.” During the 1980s and 1990s, Ardbeg suffered from an uncertain future and it was not until the brand was purchased by The Glenmorangie Company in 1997 that the Distillery was saved from extinction. Since then, the Distillery has risen like a phoenix and today Ardbeg is well established as a niche, cult malt, with a passionate following.",Ardbeg to Release Limited Edition Ardbeg Drum in June
"—Illy, which transformed coffee in 1935 by inventing the modern espresso machine, has again changed its industry by introducing illy Cold Brew Aria, a tap handle with an embedded adjustable valve that turns cold brew with bubbles, commonly called “nitro cold brew,” into an even richer-tasting and effervescent experience for coffee lovers, and easier for cafes, restaurants, hotels resorts and other on-premise venues to offer. The tap handle-mounted valve draws in ambient air, requires no bulky gas tanks and is offered exclusively for use with illy cold brew made from the brand’s legendary Classico blend, comprised of nine distinct Arabica coffee beans from different countries, produced and sourced to deliver sustainable quality and a premium profit for farmers meeting illy’s industry-leading standards.",2019-04-1,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/01145043/illycaffe___Cold_Brew_Aria-320x320.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/illy-launches-cold-brew-aria-tap-handle,"NEW YORK—Illy, which transformed coffee in 1935 by inventing the modern espresso machine, has again changed its industry by introducing illy Cold Brew Aria, a tap handle with an embedded adjustable valve that turns cold brew with bubbles, commonly called “nitro cold brew,” into an even richer-tasting and effervescent experience for coffee lovers, and easier for cafes, restaurants, hotels resorts and other on-premise venues to offer. The tap handle-mounted valve draws in ambient air, requires no bulky gas tanks and is offered exclusively for use with illy cold brew made from the brand’s legendary Classico blend, comprised of nine distinct Arabica coffee beans from different countries, produced and sourced to deliver sustainable quality and a premium profit for farmers meeting illy’s industry-leading standards.

The patent pending valve that is the heart of illy Cold Brew Aria system captures ambient air — already 78 percent nitrogen-rich, by nature — that is immediately infused at high pressure into illy cold brew coffee as it’s dispensed. The combination creates a beautiful, long cascading effect in the glass and a rich creamy head. illy Cold Brew Aria is the first-ever system that infuses ambient air into coffee to create a “nitro effect” without the use of space-consuming nitrogen tanks or air compressors.

Importantly, the illy Cold Brew Aria valve is adjustable and able to vary the levels of air and effervescence infused into cold brew, all the way down to no bubbles at all. The net result: illy Cold Brew Aria is the only system that can produce either effervescent or regular cold brew with only one tap handle and one coffee source, saving yet more precious real state behind the bar, in the kitchen or wherever else cold brew can be offered on-premise.

The ultimate combination for cafes, restaurants, hotels and every place else that aims to delight discerning coffee lovers is the illy Cold Brew Aria system paired with illy’s other new innovation: Bag-in-a-Box. This five-liter soft package, packaged in a compact box, is filled with perfectly-prepared illy cold brew, eliminating the need for baristas and other staff to manage and monitor up to 12 hours of preparation.

Designed for either tap or non-tap dispensing, when paired with a tap, illy Bag-in-a-Box Cold Brew eliminates the need for delivery and storage of heavy, space-consuming kegs. Bag-in-a-Box cold brew remains stable during nine months of ambient storage time and can be served for up to five days once the packaging is opened. At the core of this innovation is illy’s long history of leveraging technology to enhance and delight coffee lovers with the best quality coffee, which can be seen at many moments in the company’s 86 years history, such as inventing pressurized packing in 1934, and the 1970s, when illy industrialized the single-serve coffee format with ESE paper pods: ideally pre-measured, -ground and -tamped, espresso dose that fit into any espresso machine and produced an optimal beverage without years of barista training, and that remain on the market today.

The Right System at the Right Time

Illy Cold Brew Aria arrives at a time when U.S. cold coffee sales are both booming and increasingly the format of choice for today’s younger, tougher to please, more on-the-go coffee consumers. Sixty-six percent of U.S. millennials regularly drink cold coffee on a year-round basis compared to 34 percent of Generation X coffee drinkers, according to Mintel Menu Insights.

The system was designed with minimal internal lines, making maintenance quick and simple. Just a five-minute daily soaking of the spout, and weekly flushing of lines, are required.

The illy Cold Brew Aria Cold Brew system is available for use by qualified illy accounts with certain volume commitments, and is currently operating in all San Francisco illy Caffè locations. The system can also be retrofitted to existing tap systems to immediately enhance product quality.

Illycaffè is an Italian family business, founded in Trieste in 1933 and committed to offering the greatest coffee to the world. illy is the world’s most global coffee brand, producing the unique illy 100% Arabica blend made of 9 of the world ‘s best selections of Arabica; each day more than 7 million cups are served in over 140 countries in the finest cafés, restaurants, hotels and in offices and homes. illy has become the standard forerunner of espresso, and thanks to three critical innovations, is considered the leader in the science and technology of coffee. With the bestowing of the first “Ernesto Illy Award for quality espresso coffee” in 1991 in Brazil, illy also pioneered direct sourcing, sharing know-how and paying a premium price for the best quality, based on partnerships underwritten by the principles of sustainable development. The company also founded the University of Coffee with the aim of fostering and spreading its culture, providing comprehensive academic and hands-on training for coffee growers, baristas and coffee lovers in order to cover every aspect of the product. Everything ‘made in illy’ is enhanced by beauty and art, which represent founding values of the brand, starting from its logo – designed by an artist, James Rosenquist – and including the renowned illy Art Collection, comprised of over 100 cups designed by international artists. In 2017 the company was employing 1,290 people, and posted consolidated revenues of €467 million. There are 244 stores and mono-brand illy shops in 43 countries.",Illy Launches Cold Brew Aria Tap Handle

Misfit Foods co-founder Ann Yang has resigned from the startup food and beverage brand, citing mental health struggles and calling for other entrepreneurs to take their health and mental wellbeing seriously in a post on Medium.

“The unique stress of being an entrepreneur hit its breaking point,” Yang wrote. “On a consultation call, a therapist asked me if I had considered whether or not I was depressed. As someone who has built a reputation around being unusually charismatic, I had not. I’ve since learned that entrepreneurs are 30% more likely than the average person to experience depression.”

Last year, Yang and her co-founder Phil Wong were named as part of the Forbes 30 Under 30 list and the brand was accepted into the Chobani Food Incubator.

The move also comes as the company enters a transitional phase — discontinuing its juice line in order to focus on food products.

“This has not been easy to write,” Yang wrote. “It’s deeply personal. But it’s always been my style to wear my heart on my sleeve.

RUNA contains 150 mg of natural caffeine from a single source, and comes in a range of sweetened and zero-calorie, zero-sugar variants. It was recently acquired by All Market Inc. (AMI), the parent company of Vita Coco.

RUNA had previously been predominately available in natural and specialty stores. The roll out through KDP markets follows successful results of a limited roll out in New York and California. The distribution and availability opportunities are especially significant in convenience, mass, grocery and drug channels, where the brand can now reach thanks to its partnership with KDP.

“RUNA is a great product with a diehard following, and we’re confident that the brand can be a real challenger to conventional energy drinks. Through a very strong partnership with DPS and now KDP, we’ve built Vita Coco into one of the largest “better for you” beverage brands in the country. We’re thrilled to continue our partnership with KDP as we build RUNA into the #1 natural energy drink,” said Michael Kirban, co-founder of All Market Inc.

The U.S. energy drink category, which is forecasted to reach $20 billion by 2021, is one of the only remaining traditional beverage categories that has yet to be disrupted by a naturally-positioned brand. Where category sales from natural and premium-positioned products are seven percent and four percent in RTD coffee/tea and sports drinks respectively, they represent only one percent in energy drinks. As consumers look to offerings that are plant based, lower in sugar, and have more natural ingredient, RUNA is primed to challenge conventional energy drinks such as Red Bull and Monster.

“We are excited to partner with RUNA to accelerate the growth of this brand, which provides KDP a truly exceptional product in the energy drink category,” said Rodger Collins, KDP’s president, direct store delivery. “Our expansive DSD network and ability to excel at in-store execution combined with AMI’s marketing capabilities and large, dedicated sales organization is a proven winner.”","Keurig Dr Pepper, RUNA Partner to Expand Distribution and Availability"

Although the local economy had been driven by the lumber industry for over a century, Bend has in recent years seen an influx of innovative companies — from tech to food and beverage — launched within its borders. According the office of Oregon’s Secretary of State, Bend registers more new businesses each year than any other city in the state.

Entrepreneurs often point to the Bend lifestyle, which is steeped in outdoor sports, snow activities and craft beer, as part of the city’s appeal and why a variety of business and consumer publications have ranked Bend as one of the best small cities to live and work in the U.S.

After spending a year and a half acquiring and developing three distinct beverage brands — Just Chill, Wild Poppy, and Victoria’s Kitchen — Life on Earth president JC Romagosa said the New York-based beverage company is now gearing up to begin supporting those products with a concerted sales and marketing push. The publicly traded company is coming off its first Natural Products Expo West trade show, and just hired a publicist and social media manager.

“What we’ve been doing is improving these brands from soup to nuts, including supply chain, production, branding, and design,” Romagosa told BevNET last week. “We’ve spent months building the infrastructure of the operating company, and now it’s time to push sales.”

Life On Earth’s approach thus far has been to seek opportunities to acquire struggling beverage brands in need of a turnaround and reposition them for success. The company, formerly known as Hispanica International, acquired Los Angeles-based almond water and lemonade brand Victoria’s Kitchen in October 2017, and followed that by picking up natural relaxation drink Just Chill in August and adding juice and soda maker Wild Poppy to its portfolio this year. Gran Nevada, which markets a variety of Latin beverage products, is also part of the roster.

The company also operates two DSD distributors — Giant Beverage in New York and Energy Source in California — which provide its brands coverage in key markets. It also works with distributors such as Haralambos in Southern California, as well as KeHE and UNFI.

CEO Fernando Oswaldo Leonzo, who ran Latin brand Gran Nevada prior to its acquisition, said the company aims to achieve cost savings and economies of scale by consolidating operations for multiple brands, such as sales and merchandising, under a single roof as they collectively scale up revenue and volume.

“Having one sales manager to cover a certain market but who is now responsible for several brands that can go into the same kind of channels alleviates the need for coverage without adding the costs of having more people on the ground,” Leonzo said, noting that the company is for the moment holding off on hiring dedicated brand managers in order to keep costs low. “Smaller brands need very high turn initially to cover their expenditures in key markets.”

With its acquisition of Just Chill, an organic natural relaxation beverage formulated with L-theanine, an amino acid that can promote relaxation and facilitate sleep, Life On Earth is aiming to play in several categories at once, including in the growing CBD beverage market. Forthcoming innovations from Just Chill include a CBD alkaline water and an organic hemp drink, both of which will be separate from the original lineup. Those innovations, due to hit stores this summer, will coincide with new flavors and zero-calorie SKUs for the core line, which is currently available in four flavors and sold in retailers such as Whole Foods (Southern California), Kroger and H-E-B.

“We believe that something that probably started 8-10 years ago, the relaxation category, got all the buzz at that time but has fallen flat because of the notion of unhealthy drinks with melatonin and high sugar,” Fernando said. “Now we fast forward to today and we think that category could possibly be an opportunity for a new category to emerge in which people are looking not so much for relaxation but for a level of functionality that does not include being juiced up from an energy standpoint. More importantly, it’s something that speaks to health conscious, organic consumers.”

While the immediate focus will be on supporting its existing brands, Romagosa said Life On Earth is still scouting for new brands to join the growing roster. He hopes the performance of its current portfolio will help attract further interest.

“We’ve been acquiring these brands for the last 18 months or so, and we expect by this summer that the plans we have been working on to make them better will come to fruition,” Romagosa said. “It gives us the ability to point and say ‘We bought this brand last year, and look what we’ve done.’ Other brands can look at that and see a proven track record.”

“We are looking at it from a synergy standpoint,” he continued. “These are the kind of things where people look at us and say ‘Is it doing something for me?’ That’s from the aspect of health, environment, social responsibility. From our perspective, we are looking for anything that can have that synergy so to speak. That’s where these products have a place in our portfolio and that’s the bet that we are making as a company.”","Post-Acquisition Streak, Life On Earth Set for 2019 Sales Push"

As part of a wide-ranging interview included in this episode, Bronner spoke about his roots with the natural soap company and how his advocacy for hemp contributed to the evolution of the brand.

Lysyj’s hiring is the second notable appointment for Boston Beer this month. Last week, the company named Uber, Inc. general manager Meghan Joyce to its board of directors.

"Functional beverage brand LifeAID announced today it has raised $7.7 million to support expanded nationwide distribution as the company seeks to grow in mass, grocery and convenience accounts across the country.",2019-04-1,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/01165950/LifeAID_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/lifeaid-raises-7-7-million-to-support-distribution-growth,"Functional beverage brand LifeAID announced today it has raised $7.7 million to support expanded nationwide distribution as the company seeks to grow in mass, grocery and convenience accounts across the country.

The round includes a combined $4.7 million in equity investments from firms Everplus Capital and Cambridge Companies Special Projects Group (SPG), as well as several angel investors. An additional $3 million in debt financing was raised from an asset-backed line of credit with Dwight Funding.

Under the terms of the deal, Everplus Capital and Cambridge SPG will work with LifeAID in an advisory capacity, but will not gain board seats.

“Working with the LifeAID team on this transaction has been highly rewarding,” Filipp Chebotarev, COO & Partner at Cambridge SPG, told BevNET in an email. “Aaron and Orion have built an innovative, fast growth, high margin business that has struck a loud chord with core customers focused on health, wellness and fitness. We look forward to being a partner in their growth journey.”

Speaking to BevNET, LifeAID co-founders Orion Melehan and Aaron Hinde said the company recently secured a chainwide expansion with Walmart, rolling out to the retailer’s 4,300 stores next month. The company is also now in 15 Kroger divisions and recently received authorization with Wegmans. LifeAID is also growing its footprint in the travel channel, adding 90 retail locations across ten East Coast airports.

Melehan said one of the company’s goals for 2019 is to provide additional support to its full functional product portfolio. Having initially built a consumer base with its FitAID line in gym channel accounts, LifeAID is now looking to provide additional marketing support for its FocusAID, ImmunityAID, and PartyAID products.

“We’re going to build a sales story around FocusAID and prove out the platform that we can build a better-for-you company with vitamin drinks that consumers actually enjoy drinking,” Melehan said. “Part of the funds is not only to backup our retail authorizations, but to create additional sales stories for our other SKUs.”

Melehan said the company is targeting grab-and-go coolers in convenience stores as a “big growth driver” for LifeAID in 2019 and 2020.

“Being shelf stable is a blessing and a curse,” Hinde said. “The blessing is we can play pretty much everywhere. The curse is we’re not guaranteed cold box. So having strong DSD partners is going to help us build out the LifeAID story, help us secure and maintain our cold box placements that our sales team has done such a great job at securing, and keep the product on the shelf.”

The company has established a DSD network in the Pacific Northwest which includes distributors The Odom Corporation, Sound Beverage Distribution Inc., Craig Stein Beverage, and NW Beverages. In Northern California, the company has partnered with DBI Beverage.",LifeAID Raises $7.7 Million to Support Distribution Growth

"The rise of CBD and hemp-infused beverages continues to be one of the major industry trends of the year. It’s being fueled by innovative brands, novel concepts and retailers seeking a piece of a market estimated to reach $260 million by 2022, according to Canaccord Genuity.",2019-04-3,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/03164816/LA-Distrib_Full-Width_1.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/distributor-profile-lad-seeks-socal-cbd-brands-with-focus,"The rise of CBD and hemp-infused beverages continues to be one of the major industry trends of the year. It’s being fueled by innovative brands, novel concepts and retailers seeking a piece of a market estimated to reach $260 million by 2022, according to Canaccord Genuity.

The role distributors will play in driving the success of this emerging market, however, shouldn’t be underestimated. Having watched Los Angeles-area retailer interest in CBD and hemp-derived products rise over recent years, LA Distributing Company (LAD) is one the independent DSD wholesalers across the country seeking to establish their bonafides working within the category, even as the legal framework around such products remains in flux.

“It’s interesting because some accounts are more bullish than others and some accounts have received letters from the California Department of Health and have decided to hold off until further notice,” LAD co-founder Richard Medina told BevNET last week, talking about CBD- and hemp-infused drinks. “Accounts that know there is a huge demand and have a positive outlook on how some of the regulation is going to change over the next few months, they take our brands and sell them hand over fist. It’s absolutely amazing for this new category but also a little scary because every single brand is just starting to have a line extension adding CBD.”

Over the past several years, California has been heavily involved in the national debate over the legal sale of CBD and hemp products. Last summer, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) issued a revised FAQ prohibiting the use of CBD derived from industrial hemp in food and beverage products, which in turn brought a response from CBD industry leaders in the state. While state health officials sort out regulations, LAD’s approach has been to offer customers a balance of CBD and hemp-infused products, which currently includes SKUs from VYBES, Sol-ti, Honeydrop and Hemp2O. VYBES, Sol-ti and Honeydrop each feature “CBD” on their packaging, while Hemp2O does not. LAD also carried hemp extract shot Hemplify until recently.

In addition to providing a pathway into different channels — VYBES sells at a limited number of influential independent accounts, while Hemp2O is aimed at chain retail partners like Kroger and Safeway — having both CBD and hemp products balances some of the risk until further clarity arrives. As Medina noted, any changes to state or federal law could change the entire dynamic of LAD’s business.

“I think CBD is going to lead the pack, but it’s going to take time,” he said. “Other [retailers] may want hemp in the meantime until they feel comfortable that CBD is permitted. I don’t want to push them too hard — I want to provide them with options so they can make a decision that they are comfortable with.”

However, Medina voiced some concern that the proliferation of products entering the market across all categories, and specifically those introduced as value-added line extensions, could dilute the CBD/hemp market just as it is beginning to emerge.

“Right now, it’s about looking for a brand that is built around CBD and that wants to be the CBD brand,” he said. “What we’ve been seeing is a lot of brands that have been built in a different category and are launching CBD line extensions. We really want to see a brand that is focusing on CBD — everything about it is CBD and they aren’t venturing away from that.”

Outside of hemp and CBD, Medina said LAD is making building a portfolio of plant-based products a main priority; for beverages, that means non-dairy milk alternatives from Elmhurst, which, he said, he prefers to category leader Oatly because of its cleaner ingredient panel. He also noted that the cyclical nature of the ready-to-drink coffee market means that retailers are beginning to ask for more shelf-stable options as the refrigerated shelf has become more crowded. LAD currently offers cold-chain products from Chameleon, Groundwork, Stumptown, Lucky Jack, Grass Fed Coffee, Taste Nirvana and Humblemaker.

“Retailers will still take refrigerated product — they know the demand is still there for black, unsweetened cold brew — but if you can bring in a shelf-stable product that looks and feels refrigerated and is premium, there is a void in that market,” he said, adding the LAD is in talks with brands like RISE Brewing Co. and Wandering Bear.

While maintaining a progressive edge, Medina noted that LAD is not set up to expand in all areas at once. The company, founded in 2012 when Medina and partner Arthur Flores exited their previous Southern California distribution company, Gourmet Purveyors International, was conceived to compete with regional players like Haralambos by focusing on providing a “one-stop solution” to a fragmented local market. This increases the value (and risk) of making successful bets on brands, according to Medina,

“Our elevator pitch is that we are where UNFI meets Costco,” he said. “We are like UNFI in that everything we have is better-for-you and healthy. We are like Costco because we have a limited SKU selection; we don’t have everything but we have the top performers in every new category.”

That approach puts extra onus on LAD to make the right calls; “If [the product] isn’t moving in two weeks, [retailers] are calling us and asking for something else,” Medina said. To avoid that potential hazard, LAD is launching an incubation program to help brands achieve proof of concept on store shelves. The fund will start somewhere between $10-25 million and will target brands with revenues of $750,000 to $2.5 million per year.

“We’ve been talking over the past year to investors asking ‘What is the next brand? How can we invest?’” Medina said. “The writing was on the wall that we need to start working with investors to broker some of these deals and more importantly start raising money and managing a fund where we can deploy capital based on what we see in our customer base.”

For the moment, CBD and hemp is as good a bet as any for where the beverage industry is going. Yet for LAD, that means finding the companies that “everything about it is CBD and they aren’t venturing away from that,” according to Medina.

“I get calls everyday from people saying they are starting a CBD water — and I say no,” Medina said. “I can just tell these are guys who went to a co-packer, threw some CBD in [water], put on a cheaper label and now it’s a race to the bottom on price — just like any other alkaline water that you may see start now, it’s a race to zero. I think now coming out with a premium [hemp or CBD] product and holding your price to ensure you have integrity on shelf — that’s what we are looking for.”","Distributor Profile: LA Distributing Seeks SoCal CBD Brands With ""Focus"""

Monster Energy has fired back against Vital Pharmaceuticals (VPX Sports) in a First Amended Complaint that accuses the Bang maker of “flagrant consumer deception and anti-competitive business practices.”,2019-04-3,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/03155217/Bang-Monster_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/update-monster-files-amended-complaint-against-vpx,"Monster Energy has fired back against Vital Pharmaceuticals (VPX Sports) in a First Amended Complaint that accuses the Bang maker of “flagrant consumer deception and anti-competitive business practices.”

The FAC, filed today in United States District Court Central District of California, is Monster’s response to a lawsuit filed by VPX last week accusing the energy drink maker of trademark infringement, trade dress infringement, and unfair competition over its use of “REIGN,” which Monster announced as the name of its new performance energy drink, positioned as a direct rival to VPX’s Bang. The complaint lists a litany of charges, including unfair competition, false advertising, trade libel, and several violations related to the protection of trade secrets,

In the complaint, which names VPX founder/CEO/chief scientific officer Jack Owoc as a plaintiff, attorneys for Monster decry VPX and Owoc’s actions as “damaging, dangerous and despicable.” These actions, according to plaintiffs’ attorneys, include lying to consumers, cheating government regulators, stealing from competitors, and misappropriation of confidential trade secret information.

“From fraudulent health claims to touting an invalid patent to outright theft, our complaint provides many documented examples of Bang’s false, misleading, anti-competitive, and improper actions,” the company said in a statement emailed to BevNET. “It is time that Bang is finally held accountable for its deception. We look forward to presenting all of the facts and revealing the truth about Bang.”

The complaint covers familiar ground from the two companies’ long history of legal strife: Monster’s lawyers contend that numerous claims made by Owoc regarding product efficacy, health benefits and scientific validation are exaggerated or outright false. It also attempts to link VPX and Owoc to “a larger pattern of rule breaking” that includes lawsuits, FDA violations, censure by the Better Business Bureau, and previous work with the supplement ephedra, which was later banned by the FDA. Attorneys note in the complaint that VPX has created a “myth” around Owoc’s business and science acumen, despite a lack of academic degrees.

However, the complaint also includes new accusations against VPX of attempting to steal trade secrets and employees from Monster. The documents cite an incident in which a Bang product manager offered a Monster employee a job in exchange for stealing proprietary pricing data from the company, and a second incident in which former Monster employees downloaded confidential information from the company before starting new roles at VPX.

“[Defendants] have… systematically interfered with competitors’ — chiefly, Monster’s — sales and contractual rights, by rewarding employees with distributors for stealing valuable in-store shelf space,” reads the filing.

Calling Monster’s shelf space “Bang’s primary target,” plaintiff’s attorneys wrote that “shelf space is often determined by contract between retailers and product vendors. Those contracts are extremely valuable, impact consumer behavior, and typically take years to earn. By short-circuiting this normal competitive process, VPX is not only stealing a contractual right from Monster, it is also effectively stealing sales and goodwill.”

“The most unfortunate part of Bang’s wide-ranging illegal scheme is that it appears to have worked,” the complaint reads. “VPX’s refusal to play by the rules has artificially boosted its sales at the expense of competitors and consumers alike. This suit will put an end to these practices, and protect Monster, its consumers, and the public.”",Update: Monster Files Amended Complaint Against VPX
"Total convenience channel sales for major categories grew at just 0.4 percent in the four week period ending March 23, underperforming all other channels according to an analysis of Nielsen scanner data by Wells Fargo Securities.",2019-04-3,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/27165452/Nielsen_Wells_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/nielsen-c-store-channel-sales-stagnant-in-march,"Total convenience channel sales for major categories grew at just 0.4 percent in the four week period ending March 23, underperforming all other channels according to an analysis of Nielsen scanner data by Wells Fargo Securities.

In a recap of current Nielsen sales figures, Bonnie Herzog, managing director of equity research at Wells Fargo, said a 5.6 percent increase in total c-store pricing for major categories likely led to a 4.9 percent drop in volume, leading to sales declines in carbonated soft drinks (CSD), beer, and cigarettes. Meanwhile, energy drinks and salty snacks saw muted growth.

Total CSD sales declined 1.3 percent in dollar sales for the four week period, according to the report, compared to a 1 percent decline in the 12 week period. Average unit prices rose 6.7 percent in the four week period, while unit sales dropped 7.5 percent. The category grew 3.6 percent across all channels in the same period.

Within CSDs, only category leader The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) reported an increase in dollar sales at 2 percent (versus 1.9 percent for the 12 week period) with total unit sales down 4.9 percent. Staying in the category, PepsiCo sales fell 3.5 percent, driven by an 8.6 percent decline in unit sales. Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) dropped 1.7 percent for the month and was down 0.1 percent for the 12 week, experiencing an 8.4 percent unit sales dip.

Energy drinks, including coffee and tea-based products, reported overall growth for the four week period at a 6.1 percent increase in dollar sales and a slight 0.1 drop in unit sales. The category saw 9 percent dollar sales growth for the 12 week period and 2.8 percent growth in unit sales. However, the category still underperformed in the convenience channel, reporting 8.1 percent growth in all channels in the same period.

Despite the positive results for energy overall, category leader Monster Energy reported a 5.4 percent dollar sales dropped and a 12 percent unit sales decline (compared to respective 0.8 percent growth and 6.7 percent decline for the 12 week period). Bang, though still relatively small — reporting $345 million in c-store dollar sales for the 52 week period compared to Monster’s $3.8 billion and Red Bull’s $3.1 billion — saw dollar sales growth of 748.3 percent in the four week period, and 807.6 percent in the 12 week.

In a separate analysis released on Tuesday, Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog noted Monster has struggled to maintain sales and volume growth over the past five to six weeks, in part due to a 6.3 percent pricing increase impacting volume sales (down 8.3 percent in the four week period) and increased competition from Red Bull and the fast growing fitness energy brand Bang.

Red Bull reported a 7.3 percent increase in dollar sales in the four week period and a 4.4 percent increase in unit sales, compared to 8.5 percent dollar sales growth and 4.1 percent unit sales growth in the 12 week. Rockstar continued its ongoing decline, down 13.7 percent in dollar sales and 16.8 percent in unit sales for the four week period.

Sports drink dollar sales were up 5.1 percent in the four week period, an improvement over 4.2 percent growth in the 12 week. PepsiCo reported a 4.6 percent drop in dollar sales, while TCCC saw a 1.5 percent increase.

Dollar sales for shelf stable juice declined 5.7 percent in the four week period, with The Coca-Cola Company reporting a 21.4 percent decline. KDP reported 1.1 percent growth and private label sales were up 18.8 percent.

Despite the weak month, the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS) reported today that the convenience channel saw record food and merchandise sales in 2018, with in-store sales up 2.2 percent to $242.2 billion.

Blue Ridge Bucha, a Certified Organic kombucha producer from the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, is located a short distance from the Appalachian Trail. The delicious new flavor is brewed with blackberries and mint, both of which can be found in areas near the Trail.

Blue Ridge Bucha co-founders Kate and Ethan Zuckerman are members of the ATC and view the trail “as a special place for our community, our team, and our customers – a symbolic path of wonderment and adventure that deserves conserving. During the spring and summer seasons, our taproom is regularly visited by Appalachian Trail thru-hikers, so we wanted to create something that toasts their journey and protects the trail that they’re trekking. We also celebrate thru-hikers by offering them a free cup of kombucha.”

Be the first to try this new flavor and help to name it. Participants will be able to submit a name suggestion with a growler purchase! The limited-edition kombucha will debut at REI Co-op’s Flip Flop Festival Kickoff Party at their Washington, D.C. flagship store on April 12. Blue Ridge Bucha will be selling the kombucha to customers in refillable glass growlers, and proceeds will go to the ATC to help protect the vast natural beauty and cultural heritage of the Appalachian Trail. Plus, in celebration of Earth Month, customers will receive $1 off their growler fill if they walk, bike or use public transportation to the party. REI’s event serves as a pre-party to the ATC’s fifth annual Flip Flop Festival, which takes place April 27 to 28 in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.

Join us at the Flip Flop Festival Kickoff Party to learn more about the Appalachian Trial and to celebrate those who hike it! In addition to supporting the ATC and enjoying the first taste of Blue Ridge Bucha’s special brew, partygoers can enjoy free bites from Chaia Tacos, Pluma, Patagonia Provisions, music from a local Bluegrass band, trip and gear experts from ATC and REI, games and more!

Beyond maintaining the Appalachian Trail footpath, the ATC is actively working to ensure the lands surrounding the trail are also preserved and protected. These areas are important not only to the world-class hiking experience the Appalachian Trail provides, but also the wildlife, communities and environments that rely on the Appalachian Mountains’ ecosystems. REI has invested over $400,000 in the ATC since 2010. Funds have supported repairing sections of trail through volunteer workdays, volunteer trainings, the Trail Ambassadors program and promoting trail safety through the ATC’s Ridgerunners program.

Crazy about kombucha? Come visit Blue Ridge Bucha at the following events this month:
• April 16: Blue Ridge Bucha co-founder, Ethan Zuckerman, will be teaching a “How To Brew Your Own Kombucha” at REI in Rockville, Maryland.

The wines will be initially distributed across the US throughout select markets.

Lubanzi, led by co-founders Walker Brown and Charles Brain, was launched in Cape Town in 2016 and named for a wandering dog who led the pair on a six-day, 100 mile backpacking trip through a remote part of South Africa’s southeastern coastline, The Wild Coast. The business operates as a social enterprise, whose mantra and mission is to help create a more sustainable and equitable supply chain. Lubanzi shares its profits with a non-profit partner in South Africa, The Pebbles Project, who provides health and educational resources to the communities who labor on South Africa’s wine farms. The company’s launch of South Africa’s first canned wine is a reflection of its ongoing commitment to environmental sustainability and innovation.

“Everything we’ve tried to do, up until this point, has not only been about trying to make great, forward-thinking, clean, and affordable wines, but also about trying to connect and showcase Cape Town & The Western Cape as a whole, a place whose cultural identity, it’s very spirit and essence, coincidentally, we think, falls so deeply in line with the growing cultural identity that now surrounds wine in cans,” said the company. “Venturing with bright eyes into the canned wine movement felt like a natural extension of who we are as a business and a brand, and a very due and deserved step in South Africa’s journey to claiming its rightful place, in quality and in innovation, at the American table.”

Like some of the American West Coast’s canned wine trailblazers, the project is about portability, sustainability and going where bottled wines simply can’t. “If any country embodies the spirit that has supported the boom of canned wine, it is South Africa.”

Built on self-described pillars of adventure, culture and global citizenship, Lubanzi still continues to focus chiefly on process and quality. The wines are Fair Trade Fair for Life certified, vegan and have received 90+ scores from notable wine critics vintage over vintage.

“The category is fantastic fun, but the quality’s the same. These wines are the same ones that go into our bottles.”

Lubanzi’s cans go live on April 1, and consumers can find them by the glass in restaurants, at their neighborhood retailers and online at www.lubanziwines.com.

Lubanzi is the sole label from Cape Venture Wine Co., a start-up, sustainable South African wine company, created in Cape Town by two young travelers, Charles Brain and Walker Brown, alongside a small collection of well-known South African winemakers, viticulturists, farm laborers and humanitarians. The name Lubanzi comes from a wandering dog that followed the founders on a 6 day, 100-mile hiking trip across South Africa’s remote Wild Coast. Built upon the notion of pioneering a more sustainable & equitable supply chain, 50 percent of its net profits are returned to a non-profit supporting the communities who labor on the country’s wine farms. Lubanzi is distributed in over 30 U.S. states and two additional countries. Lubanzi is also a certified B Corporation.

Although the local economy had been driven by the lumber industry for over a century, Bend has in recent years seen an influx of innovative companies — from tech to food and beverage — launched within its borders. According the office of Oregon’s Secretary of State, Bend registers more new businesses each year than any other city in the state.

Entrepreneurs often point to the Bend lifestyle, which is steeped in outdoor sports, snow activities and craft beer, as part of the city’s appeal and why a variety of business and consumer publications have ranked Bend as one of the best small cities to live and work in the U.S.

In a recent visit to Bend, we met with a few of its food and beverage entrepreneurs and community leaders to learn more about the reasons behind its emergence as a business capital on the West Coast.

How, one might ask, does he plan on doing that? Simple. A lot of soap and a dash of psychedelics.

Since Bronner took the reins of his family’s business in 1998, Dr. Bronner’s has become the top-selling brand of natural soaps in North America. The company, which also markets natural toothpaste, lip balm, shaving cream and coconut oil, generated $122 million in sales in 2018, over 30 times its revenue when Bronner took over.

Dr. Bronner’s, which was founded as a non-profit, religious organization dedicated to world peace, has used that growth to fuel its advocacy for social and environmental causes. The company has donated tens of millions of dollars into efforts supporting GMO transparency, the integration of cannabis and psychedelic drugs into American medicine, and regenerative organic agriculture.

As part of a wide-ranging interview included in this episode, Bronner spoke about his roots with the natural soap company and how his advocacy for hemp contributed to the evolution of the brand. He also explained why he supports the use of psychedelics within the context of the company’s philanthropic strategy, discussed what makes Dr. Bronner’s concept of corporate responsibility different, and how it is preserving its legacy.",Ep. 156: Why Psychedelics and Soap Might Just Save the World

Production of Top Note’s mixers is expected to begin in July once a cold pasteurizer and customized bottling line parts are installed at the brewery.

“As a company, we’re focused on producing the highest quality flavor profiles and most innovative product line in the mixer category,” said Mary Pellettieri, co-founder of Top Note. “We formulate our sparkling mixers in our flavor kitchen in Milwaukee with all natural botanical extracts, real juices, cane sugar and non-GMO acids. It’s our hand-crafted approach to sparkling mixers that is driving us to work with the talented team of brewers at Octopi. We know they can match our desire for high quality and attention to detail.”

Octopi will produce Top Note’s award-winning Indian Tonic Water, Classic Tonic Water, Grapefruit Soda, Ginger Beer Soda and Bitter Lemon Soda in 8.5 oz. bottles in 4-packs. The beverages were previously produced by a co-packer in Pennsylvania.

There are a number of financial and innovation advantages related to the move. Top Note expects to double its sales in the Madison area and utilize Octopi’s sister distributor in Minneapolis to engage its growing tonic-loving customers there. The company will save tens of thousands of dollars in freight each year. Plus, Top Note now has the opportunity to explore Octopi’s canning capabilities, which would drive growth since it would offer another format to retailers.

According to Octopi’s owner, Isaac Showaki, “Mary has always been a great help to us with sharing her knowledge of beer quality so we knew someday we would want to help her make her products here at Octopi in Wisconsin. We couldn’t be more thrilled to be the first craft brewer in the country making craft sodas and sparkling mixers with an industry leader.”

For Pellettieri, a craft brewing veteran, there’s the excitement of working with a group of seasoned brewers to ideate and develop new formulas and even innovate in the club soda space.

“We’re always looking to put American ingenuity into our products and this is another way to do that,” Pellettieri explained. “Our intent is to add diversity to the category of sparkling beverage mixers and soda water in a fresh and innovative way. We’re making a statement by moving our production to a brewery. We want distributors, retailers and consumers to know that we’re shaking things up with our unconventional approach to this category of non-alcoholic beverages.”

Pellettieri says Top Note is planning to add an array of unique club sodas to its beverage lineup in 2020 or even sooner.

Top Note crafts the most complex and layered beverage mixers on the market. Co-founder Mary Pellettieri spent 20 years as one of the brightest minds in the craft beer game. Having mastered the art of making award-winning beer, Pellettieri set her sights on revolutionizing sparkling mixers. Featuring unique botanicals and unexpected ingredients, Top Note mixers meet the demands of the craft cocktail movement and fill the flavor gap between sweet and dry sparkling water. Top Note allows consumers to experiment with confidence and create complex, not complicated, cocktails and mocktails. The Top Note product lineup currently includes Ginger Beer Soda, Grapefruit Soda, Bitter Lemon Soda, Classic Tonic Water and the company’s award-winning Indian Tonic Water.

"Just days after announcing the departure of Monster Energy from its portfolio, New York distributor Big Geyser is using the exit as a springboard to jump start a new phase in its category strategy.",2019-04-5,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/05165334/uptime-c4_fullwidth.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/distribution-roundup-big-geyser-revamps-energy-roster-post-monster,"Just days after announcing the departure of Monster Energy from its portfolio, New York distributor Big Geyser is using the exit as a springboard to jump start a new phase in its category strategy.

The shift comes after Big Geyser CEO Jerry Reda confirmed earlier this week the dissolution of the distributor’s contract with Monster after a seven-plus year run. Following Monster’s recent shift to Coca-Cola franchised distributors in other territories, Big Geyser was the last independent DSD house still carrying the brand’s products. But now the energy maker will pass over to Philadelphia-based Liberty Coca-Cola, which has also taken on other Coke brands, such as Honest Tea and vitaminwater, which have also left Big Geyser as part of the soda giant’s years-long refranchising of its national bottling network. Members of the Monster sales team were present at Big Geyser’s Manhattan retailer show last week, showing off new Swiss Chocolate and Ultra Paradise SKUs, but today is the last day Monster products will be on trucks.

While a confidentiality agreement prevented him from discussing the details of Monster’s exit, Reda said he had “nothing but positive comments” for the brand.

“[President] Rodney [Sacks], [vice chairman] Hilton [Schlosberg] and [president of the Americas] Emelie [Tirre] handled it in a professional and courteous manner and we wish them good luck,” he said.

With Monster gone, however, Reda said Big Geyser plans to take advantage of being free from an exclusivity deal with the brand for terms “energy” and “energy drinks” by expanding its offerings in the space. At a retailer exhibition show held today in Long Island, the distributor announced two new brands — Uptime and fitness oriented “performance energy” drink C4 — set to join a product roster that also includes Kitu Life Super Coffee, natural energy sparkling water Yerbae, and lightly caffeinated sparkling waters from Sparkling Ice and Phocus.

“We think that they are all very different brands, and we’ve proven that we can bring other brands to the same category simultaneously,” Reda said, referencing the distributors’ experience working with waters like Essentia, Core and Hint. “They are all well-funded entrepreneurial companies with a unique point of view.”

In addition to the new drinks, Reda also announced a new product under the Hal’s New York trademark: Hal’s New York Kettle Chips. He told BevNET the chip line was developed to fill a gap in its snack portfolio after Deep River Snacks exited the distributor after its acquisition by Wise Snacks. He said the line will seek to build off consumer awareness of the Hal’s brand of flavored seltzers.

Organic sparkling yerba mate maker Clean Cause is aiming to take its mission nationwide, having raised $3.75 million while building out a DSD network on the West and East Coasts.

According to founder and CEO Wes Hurt, the Austin, Texas-based company is projecting to add 1,600 chain stores over the next few months and hit an eight-digit revenue by the end of 2019. Clean, launched its current line in January 2018, donates 50 percent of its profits to drug and alcohol addiction recovery programs.

Hurt told BevNET Clean Cause will add new accounts including Whole Foods Northeast region, multiple Safeway divisions, Fred Meyer, Raley’s and Natural Grocers. The brand is also sold in regional West Coast chains including Nugget Markets and New Seasons Market. Hurt said the projects it will be in more than 7,500 accounts by the end of the third quarter.

Since the fourth quarter of last year, Clean Cause has added new distribution partners across the country including John Lenore & Company in San Diego, Morris Distributing in San Francisco, Rainforest Distribution in New York, Los Angeles Distributing, Columbia Distributing in the Pacific Northwest, and New Age Beverage in Colorado.

Hurt noted that the company has benefited from Guayaki’s shift to a self-distribution model, as Clean Cause offers distributors an adjacent yerba mate-based product to “fill the void” left by the category leader’s absence. While consumers of the West Coast are largely familiar with yerba mate, Hurt acknowledged a need to expand consumer education on the East Coast.

“We decided not to reinvent the wheel, but to slightly redesign it,” Hurt said. “Following Guayaki’s lead, and knowing they spent the last 15 years on the West Coast building brand and category awareness, it’s difficult to sell yerba mate on the East Coast. People don’t know what it is. But up and down the West Coast we can really be that more natural and clean energy source.”

The company is also closing a $3.75 million funding round, with additional funding to be confirmed in the coming weeks. Investors were not disclosed, but Hurt noted the equity round is a mix of institutional and angel investors.

“We’re gaining distribution, retailers are liking it, we’re seeing growth and interest in the category, we’ve raised money, and we’re coming into season so it’s time to rock and roll,” he said.

Low calorie lemonade startup LEMI is on pace to grow its retail footprint to 25 states by its one-year launch anniversary on June 1, founder and president Bill Stineman told BevNET this week.

The Wisc.-based brand markets a line of 15-calorie lemonade sweetened with real fruit juice and sucralose. The line includes Original, Blue Raspberry, Peach, and Strawberry varieties available in 16 oz cans.

Stineman, a veteran of the lemonade category, said the brand began in order to offer a good tasting, low sugar alternative to the typically indulgent lemonade category. Funded with friends and family investments, the brand has quickly found distribution in the convenience and grocery channels, adding more than 5,000 locations over the past two months, including 1,800 Casey’s General Stores, 350 Kum and Go stores, 125 Terrible Herbst locations, and 145 Kroger accounts in Wisconsin and Illinois.

Over the past four months, Stineman said, LEMI has built out its distribution network through the Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors networks, adding AB aligned Wisconsin Distributors, Lake Shore Beverage in Illinois, and the company’s entire Alabama network, as well as Miller aligned Maine Pine State Distributing and Bonanza Beverage in Nevada. The company is also serviced by Romer Beverage in Arizona, and is in the process of launching Southern California with ACE Beverage, Straub Distributing, and Pacific Beverage.

According to Stineman, LEMI currently employs nine sales representatives and recently brought in former Constellation Brands regional sales manager Rick Sprink to serve as VP of sales.

Ten months after its acquisition by All Market Inc., clean energy brand Runa has signed a nationwide distribution partnership with Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP). KDP, which also distributes All Market’s flagship brand Vita Coco, will work to expand Runa’s presence outside of the natural and specialty channels by targeting convenience, mass, grocery, and drug accounts.

“We are excited to partner with Runa to accelerate the growth of this brand, which provides KDP a truly exceptional product in the energy drink category,” said Rodger Collins, KDP’s president of direct store delivery, in a press release. “Our expansive DSD network and ability to excel at in-store execution combined with AMI’s marketing capabilities and large, dedicated sales organization is a proven winner.”",Distribution Roundup: Big Geyser Revamps Energy Roster Post-Monster

This month Dirty Lemon launches +retinol, its latest foray in nutricosmetics and the first-ever drinkable retinol to deliver youthful looking skin, reduce the appearance of fine lines and stimulate natural collagen production.

+retinol features a proprietary powerhouse blend developed by Dirty Lemon’s Research & Development team. The innovative ingredients are designed to reduce fine lines and increase skin elasticity while reducing inflammation and redness.

Retinol, also known as vitamin A, stimulates the production of fibroblasts (responsible for the constant renewal of healthy skin cells). As we age, skin cell turnover and collagen production decreases, meaning the skin gets weaker and wrinkles begin to appear. An extra boost of retinoic acid, triggered by retinol supplementation, may help to counteract this process.

+retinol features “pro-retinols,” a milder form of vitamin A derived from retinyl esters that metabolize in the body as retinoic acid, paired with an antioxidant rich blend of superfoods (Black Cherry, Ginger and Pomegranate).

Does +retinol Contain Any Other Active Ingredients?
• Ginger: packed with key vitamins and minerals with antibacterial properties
• Hibiscus Flower: antioxidant-rich botanical known to reduce oxidative stress and cell damage

Clinical studies in this area are based on consistent daily use over a 6-12 week test period. Our potent pro-retinol formula contains 100 percent of the daily recommended dose of vitamin A. Do not consume if you are breastfeeding, pregnant or may become pregnant.

Dirty Lemon was created to meet the evolving taste and preference of the modern consumer. The brand offers a range of innovative, ready-to-drink beverages to improve customers’ everyday routine. Each beverage incorporates high quality, functional ingredients that have been used in the naturopathic space for decades, blended with a base of organic lemon juice, ocean minerals and pink Himalayan pink sea salt (a natural source of electrolytes). Each beverage has less than 30 calories and less than one gram of sugar. The company’s SMS-based distribution technology enables seamless communication with customers and frictionless access to its portfolio of beverages by selling exclusively via text message. Since its unprecedented launch in 2015, Dirty Lemon has sold over two million bottles to more than 100,000 customers worldwide.

Founded in 2018, Iris Nova, Latin for “new lens,” is the parent company to Dirty Lemon and the first company in the world to sell its product through a direct-to-consumer conversational commerce (cCommerce) model, which interacts with customers exclusively via text message. Iris Nova’s disruptive distribution strategy enables the company to meet the rapidly evolving tastes and preference of the modern consumer.

Inspired by its home state of California and an abundance of fresh, local ingredients, Bentwing Brandy offers a unique take on the growing California brandy category, by marrying new American know-how with Old World eau de vie blending techniques.

Following the success of Hangar 1’s established portfolio of grape-based vodkas and the rise of brandy in California’s cocktail culture, the expansion into the brandy category was a natural progression for the brand.

“Bentwing Brandy takes our grape-based blending expertise a step further, celebrating both fresh California ingredients and old European heritage,” said Shoemaker. “Brandy is historically at the heart of many cocktails that we commonly associate with whiskey. I’ve loved experimenting with our brandy and discovering that it easily fits into so many of the classic cocktails that I already know and love.”

Paying homage to the brand’s aviation history and its home at the former Alameda Naval Air Station, Bentwing Brandy is also a nod to where Hangar 1 started, taking its name from the inventive gull wing aircrafts used during WWII: the ‘Bentwing Bird.’

Perfect for spirits and culinary enthusiasts alike, Bentwing Brandy is finished in charred whiskey barrels, which lends a unique, well-rounded flavor profile to classic cocktails like the Metropolitan and Sidecar.
• Aroma: Fruit-forward with notes of honey, dried berries and toasted almonds
• Palate: Mouthfeel is well-rounded, with notes of deep caramelized sugar, tobacco leaves and a hint of seasoned oak

Bentwing Brandy is bottled at 40 percent ABV (80 proof), has a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $29.99 (750ml) and is available at fine retailers nationwide as well as upscale restaurants and bars. Purchases and tastings can also be made by visiting the distillery in Alameda, California. Visit hangarone.com for more information and where to buy.

Founded in Alameda, California, Hangar 1 Vodka began production in 2001 in an old WWII aircraft hangar, the inspiration for the brand’s name. Using traditional European eau de vie techniques, the finest Midwestern grain and ripe wine grapes are combined to create an incomparably smooth vodka with a softening hint of fruit essence. Hangar 1 introduced its “Straight” vodka in 2002 and has since gone on to redefine the flavored vodka category by incorporating just-harvested fruits purchased from local farms. Its core line of flavored extensions includes Mandarin Blossom, Makrut Lime and Buddha’s Hand Citron. In 2014, Hangar 1 moved to a nearby hangar space to set-up its own distillery and visitor center with the leadership of a new Head Distiller, Caley Shoemaker. In 2019, Hangar 1 Vodka became The Hangar 1 Distillery with the release of its first-ever non-vodka offering: Bentwing Brandy. The Hangar 1 Distillery is proud to create American-made spirits using traditional distillation methods and the finest ingredients that nature has to offer.

"If you are going to break into a crowded category like energy shots, you need a plan.",2019-04-4,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/04125805/Drink-Tru_Full-Width_2.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/truenergy-using-functionality-new-funding-to-fuel-next-growth-phase,"If you are going to break into a crowded category like energy shots, you need a plan.

For Jack McNamara, the founder and CEO of DrinkTru, the coming weeks and months will test if his plan to disrupt the space bears fruit. Having built the Boston-based company around a single SKU, McNamara is aiming to guide DrinkTru through a critical growth stage by expanding its product lineup into on-trend functional categories and securing new financing and advisors.

“Investors have told me ‘you are at the point where you need to blow the doors off this thing and step to the plate and take a swing, or it’s going to fail,’” he told BevNET last week. “We have to prove this concept in a big way and then we have to raise $2 to $3 million and get to that next milestone. It’s not just about learning anymore — it’s about making decisions and scaling quickly.”

DrinkTru’s new product lineup reflects a handful of the popular functional properties driving the beverage market today. Aimed at the fitness demographic, TruPower contains similar caffeine content (200 mg) and nutritional profile (branch chain amino acids, beta alanine) as “performance energy” products such as Bang and C4. Meanwhile, TruRescue provides all natural “recovery,” and TruDream is the latest entrant to the growing sleep aid category. Finally, the brand is launching TruBreeze +Hemp, which contains 10 mg of full spectrum hemp per 1.69 oz. bottle.

Since launching DrinkTru in 2015, McNamara, a former professional hockey player, has embraced the lifestyle of a committed entrepreneur, including sacrificing the comforts of home to live in a gym. He has chronicled the successes and setbacks of trying to launch a beverage brand by breaking the fourth wall of the DrinkTru website in blog post entries with titles like “Take the Crazy Plunge and Unlock Your Inner Entrepreneur” and “You’re Not Crazy for Wanting to Be An Entrepreneur.”

Despite the hyperbolic postings, the journey thus far has been slow but steady. Until now, the company was exclusively focused on TruEnergy, which features natural caffeine (100 mg), vitamins, electrolytes, antioxidants, and coconut water in a 1.69 oz. bottle. The product is available in approximately 700 stores, including Hyvee and Massachusetts-based grocery chain Roche Bros.

The company leveraged acceptance into a pilot program called Startup 52 into a spot in the FoodX accelerator program in 2017, which resulted in McNamara securing a $25,000 investment from New Jersey-based SOS Ventures. During that time, McNamara said he purposefully cast a wide net In searching for investors and advisors. After pitching the brand over a period of several years to everyone from college friends to real estate developers and VC firms, he managed to assemble a diverse patchwork of investors that landed the company $567,000 in an early funding round.

SOS Ventures is now the second largest stakeholder, with around 10 percent of the company. Other backers include former NHL player David McIntyre and current player Chris Wagner, as well as Rob Soni, an early investor in brands like Bai and Sir Kensington’s.

“It wasn’t a traditional round with someone putting up half the money and then more smaller investors,” McNamara said, noting checks ranging from $5,000 to $100,000. “There is definitely a domino effect once you start getting some really awesome people on board on the investment side.”

Despite the boost from new funding, Tru still faces a hegemonic challenge in 5-Hour Energy, which represents over 90 percent of the shot category. Along with that brand, consumers are seeing expanded options when it comes to functional shots of all types. Coffee shot maker FORTO has emerged as a disruptive brand in the space, thanks in part to support from Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP). Meanwhile, traditionally moribund segments of the shot category — such as hangover recovery and sleep products — have, for different reasons, enjoyed an uptick in activity in recent months.

Even with the core TruEnergy line only beginning to develop a presence in retail, McNamara said the need to create a strong differentiator from its competition helped fuel his decision to revamp the line with multiple new SKUs.

“I knew that just launching another energy shot wouldn’t be enough to make us successful, despite being natural,” McNamara said. “I thought one unique way to go about it was to launch a new function with each new flavor.”

In stepping into the exploding hemp and CBD market with TruBreeze +Hemp, available in Pineapple Express flavor, McNamara said establishing strong and consistent record of product efficacy was key for his brand. Acknowledging the difficulty in breaking through the noise, he said the company purchased “literally the most expensive [hemp] we could find” — a nano-encapsulated full spectrum hemp paste that cost over $14,000 for 0.5 kg. The company then worked with a secondary processor to produce the actual product.

TruBreeze +Hemp will carry a premium price point of $3.99 at retail, compared to $2.49 for the brand’s other products. McNamara said he wants to keep Tru’s offerings at an accessible price, but that positioning the hemp SKU also brought other considerations.

“This was 100 percent a legal maneuver to use hemp and not CBD,” he said. “I’m confident if we have TruCBD, it would do much better than TruBreeze +Hemp. But I’m trying to hedge our bets. Down the road, when things become clear from an FDA standpoint, that’s when we’ll go the other way.”

For the short-term, however, Tru is working to take its expanded lineup deeper into the areas in which it has connected with consumers. According to purchasing data, this means primarily women aged 25-35 in urban centers; McNamara said the brand’s marketing strategy will be recalibrated to target that demographic. As part of the investment, a pair of experienced hands — John Wetzonis, senior VP of sales at Polar, and Scott Moffitt, president of coffee creamers and beverages at Danone — have joined the company’s board. McNamara also hired his first employee, who is handling operations, financing and manufacturing.

Looking further ahead, McNamara also said Tru has plans to release full-sized ready-to-drink versions of its shots line. He said the company produced a prototype of the canned product, but has since put the project on the back burner to focus on supporting the launch of the new shots.

“I’m not really a believer in going with one product really hard,” he said. “I’m more in the business of creating a really cool brand that offers something for everyone.”","DrinkTru Using Functionality, New Funding to Fuel Next Growth Phase"

The first citrus-flavored vodka to be introduced by Stoli in more than a decade, Lime will roll out nationwide this month and enters the market with a 96-point platinum rating from the Beverage Testing Institute (BTI). The flavor appears to have a thirsty target with lime being the most popular fruit to pair with vodka and serving as the second-most used ingredient in cocktail recipes overall, with simple syrup coming in first, according to Difford’s Guide.

Stoli Lime aims to conquer the challenges that bartenders and consumers face when making cocktails – the sour and over-powering flavor from bottled lime juices and the short shelf life of fresh juices and limes. A bold and juicy flavor with distinct notes of freshly pressed lime and a smooth fruity finish, Stoli Lime will carry the tagline “Ripe for the Drinking.” The sweet, fresh flavor blends perfectly with drinks including the Gimlet, Vojito (vodka mojito) and the Moscow Mule – still the no. 1 vodka cocktail in the U.S. It also complements other flavors well with Stoli promoting a Cherry Limeade serve and a Strawberry Limeade, which uses equal parts Lime and Stoli Crushed Strawberry.

Mike Oringer, senior VP of innovation and trade marketing for Stoli Group, said, “With the citrus-flavored vodka category growing at 11 percent and outpacing total vodka by more than 4 percent, our goal was to create a refreshing, versatile product to complement some of the most popular cocktails for bars and at-home occasions. Early testing showed that Stoli Lime has a natural taste and consumers prefer it to competitive brands currently on the market. Last year, we introduced Stoli Cucumber, which received a 97-point rating from the BTI, so we are primed for a very green summer.”

Stoli Lime is 75 proof, or 37.5 percent alcohol by volume (ABV) and has a suggested retail price of $19.99 for a 750mL bottle and $22.99 for a 1L bottle. For more information, visit stoli.com or follow Stoli on Instagram @Stoli, on Facebook @Stoli and on Twitter @Stoli.

“The support of the local community saved us,” said founder and CEO Jim Martin. “Without it, we wouldn’t be here today. These limited edition crates made by local artists are our way of not only giving back to the community that saved us, but will help us raise the money needed to finish rebuilding our headquarters with a tasting room where our patrons can relax and become a part of the Key West family.” A portion of the proceeds from the sale of each box goes to a local charity supporting hurricane keys relief.

There are a variety of crates for purchase that include:
• An Evening Together in Style: Crate + 750 ml Bottle + 2 Etched Bourbon Glasses + 2 Tee Shirts ($156.59)

“Q has established itself early on as a differentiated and exciting brand led by a passionate and entrepreneurial team,” said Eurazeo Brands CEO Jill Granoff in a press release. “Given the tremendous growth opportunity within this category, we are excited to be partnering with Q.”

Launched in 2008, Q Mixers has emerged as a success story within the fast-growing premium cocktail mixer segment. The brand markets a variety of non-GMO tonics and sodas in retailers nationwide, including Target, Kroger and Whole Foods.

The company previously raised an $11 million funding round led by First Beverage Group in 2016.

Speaking with BevNET today, Q Mixers founder and CEO Jordan Silbert said that the company started actively exploring options for another fundraising round about a year ago. During that time, he said an evolution in the marketplace confirmed to him that the company should “go big on our next round,” noting increased awareness of the brand and the premium mixer category overall. Having initially built its presence in high-end bars and restaurants, Silbert said Q Mixers’ more recent growth has come from mainstream grocery retailers, citing 30-40 percent organic growth at Kroger last year.

Through its own consumer research, the company also found that it enjoyed strong loyalty among customers who had tried its products, but that its overall awareness amongst premium spirits and mixers aficionados was relatively low.

“We’ve watched the market evolve and reach an inflection point,” he said. “We think there’s a lot of growth [in the space] and we want to put ourselves in a position to invest aggressively against that growth.”

As part of the deal, Jim Goldman, a senior advisor at Eurazeo and a former president of Campbell Soup’s North American Food and Beverage Division, will join the board of directors at Q Mixers. He will be joined by George Birman, consumer growth investor at Eurazeo.

In partnering with New York-based Eurazeo Brands, Q Mixers joins an investment group with $800 million to deploy towards supporting premium CPG brands across a range of categories. The company’s current portfolio includes Nest Fragrances and Pat McGrath Labs. As part of the deal, Jim Goldman, a former CEO of Godiva Chocolate and a former president of Campbell Soup’s North American Food and Beverage Division, will join the board of directors at Q Mixers. He will be joined by George Birman, consumer growth investor at Eurazeo.

Silbert noted the appeal of bringing in senior level operators — including Granoff, who previously served as CEO of Kenneth Cole — with experience in high-end branded products to guide Q Mixers forward. He said the new funding will go towards growing both the company’s trade and consumer marketing efforts, the details of which were yet to be determined.

“We are really excited about playing this game to win,” said Silbert. “We’ve been really disciplined for 12-13 years now. We feel this inflection point and we want to race ahead and act as a category leader.”",Q Mixers Lands $40M Investment From Eurazeo Brands
Over a year since ,2019-04-4,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/04173726/DayTrip_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/cbd-startup-daytrip-taps-former-rockstar-evp-cannata,"Over a year since leaving the beverage business, former Rockstar Energy EVP of sales Joey Cannata is returning as the president of Daytrip, a new cannabis-based food and beverage startup launching next month.

In taking on the role at Daytrip, which markets a CBD-infused sparkling water, Cannata is the latest recruit to the Calif.-based brand co-founded by CEO Shawn Biega, a former VP of sales at Fogdog Cold Brew, and chief creative officer Bill Kerr. He joins a team that features a handful of other industry veterans, including Board of Directors chairman Hap Klopp, founder and former CEO of The North Face; former North Face CFO Jeff Kohr; and current Purity Organic CEO Douglas Abrams.

In a phone call today, Cannata told BevNET that he first became interested in the cannabis space after investing in vape pen company Dosist. Seeking deeper involvement in the growing market for CBD and THC infused products, he reached out to industry contacts to find a brand in the beverage space he could invest in.

“It immediately jumped out to me,” Cannata said. “It’s the best trademark I’ve seen, it’s the best name I’ve seen, the team looked very solid…. I said ‘okay, I’m interested in this brand’ because I didn’t want to invest in more than one, I wanted to pick my jockey and my horse and go with it.”

Daytrip is currently establishing a distribution network and plans to rollout next month through ecommerce and in independent retail accounts. The CBD-infused sparkling water line includes Cherry, Coconut Pineapple, Lemon Lime, and Tangerine flavors which contain 5 calories and 10 mg of CBD per 12 oz can. It will retail for $4.99 per unit. A THC-infused line, which will only be available in California dispensaries, features the same flavor lineup and 5 mg of THC per 12 oz bottle.

Cannata called the cannabis beverage category the most “exciting” he’s seen since he first joined Rockstar in 2001. He compared the space today as being similar to the energy category 20 years ago, in that it is generating massive consumer interest with functional products, but still requires significant consumer education and faces regulatory hurdles.

“I compare it to Canada and energy drinks,” he said. “Taurine wasn’t allowed at one point, but you still saw it out there. And by the time Canada flipped the switch and allowed taurine in — Boom! Red Bull was everywhere in a matter of weeks and Rockstar was soon to follow right after we did a deal with Coca-Cola Enterprises. Once the switch is turned in the U.S., you’re going to see CBD products everywhere.”

Though Daytrip is launching with sparkling water products — a more than $2.3 billion category which is also seeing strong growth and rising consumer interest — the company is focused on cannabis-based products. According to Cannata, once the brand is established in the market, the innovation pipeline may include plays into other food and beverage categories including gummies, sparkling coconut water, chocolates, and kombucha.

Speaking to BevNET, CMO Lynn Furge said the company seeks to beat out competition on flavor and brand identity. With tough competition in the space from other CBD sparkling waters like Recess, Weller, and Sprig, she said the brand will position itself against some of the prevailing category trends with a stronger flavor profile that reduces the “earthy aftertaste” of CBD and an uplifting marketing campaign that counters the cure-all messaging of other companies while leaning on its California-origins.

“What’s coming out of a lot of CBD companies, regardless of what type of product they make whether it be a vitamin or a beverage or a bar, is we’re seeing a lot of this anxiety ridden ‘you’re broken, you’re stressed, you’re in a digital always on world that’s horrible and we have the cure for you,’” Furge said. “Our approach, what we truly believe in, is that happier is healthier.”

As for the THC business, Cannata compared the approach to Juul maker PAX Labs, which split its vape pen business into separate cannabis and tobacco entities. Though for Daytrip both sides of the company will bear the same branding, they will operate separately with different teams. Whereas the CBD side is aiming to go nationwide quickly, the THC side will by necessity take a slower, state-by-state approach.",CBD Startup Daytrip Taps Former Rockstar EVP Cannata

How, one might ask, does he plan on doing that? Simple. A lot of soap and a dash of psychedelics.

Since Bronner took the reins of his family’s business in 1998, Dr. Bronner’s has become the top-selling brand of natural soaps in North America. The company, which also markets natural toothpaste, lip balm, shaving cream and coconut oil, generated $122 million in sales in 2018, over 30 times its revenue when Bronner took over.

Dr. Bronner’s, which was founded as a non-profit, religious organization dedicated to world peace, has used that growth to fuel its advocacy for social and environmental causes. The company has donated tens of millions of dollars into efforts supporting GMO transparency, the integration of cannabis and psychedelic drugs into American medicine, and regenerative organic agriculture.

As part of a wide-ranging interview included in this episode, Bronner spoke about his roots with the natural soap company and how his advocacy for hemp contributed to the evolution of the brand. He also explained why he supports the use of psychedelics within the context of the company’s philanthropic strategy, discussed what makes Dr. Bronner’s concept of corporate responsibility different, and how it is preserving its legacy.",Ep. 156: Why Psychedelics and Soap Might Just Save the World

Smith is the founder and CEO of Simple Mills, a brand of natural baking mixes, crackers and cookies, that she launched in 2013. Over the past six years, Simple Mills has become one of the leading natural brands in the spaces in which it plays.

The staves bring out notes of cocoa and caramel, without the bitterness that can sometimes come with additional aging.

“David and I have always been passionate about creative, pioneering spirits,” said co-founder Steve Revare. “The finishing process of our Double Oaked Bourbon creates a smooth, distinctive flavor and an exceptional spirit. This is further proof that our distillers’ demanding attention to detail creates a one-of-a-kind product.”

The distillery, named for the infamous Prohibition political boss Tom Pendergast, lives by his famous quote, “The people are thirsty.” Their award-winning spirits include Pendergast’s Royal Gold Bourbon, Tom’s Town Botanical Gin, Tom’s Town Barreled Gin, Tom’s Town Double Grain Vodka, and Tom’s Town Double Oaked Bourbon. In Fall 2018, Tom’s Town announced national distribution plans, branching out from the Kansas City area into twelve states, including California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia.

Founded in 2015, Tom’s Town Distilling Co. is the first legal distillery in downtown Kansas City since Prohibition. From its historic Crossroads district location, the distillery produces premium craft spirits and harkens back to the thriving era when infamous political boss Tom Pendergast controlled Kansas City. Its award-winning spirits include Pendergast’s Royal Gold Bourbon, Tom’s Town Botanical Gin, Tom’s Town Barreled Gin and Tom’s Town Double Grain Vodka. In addition to multiple spirit awards, Tom’s Town was voted Best Craft Vodka Distillery by USA Today in 2017. Tom’s Town promotes responsible drinking habits.

The campaign is Essentia’s call to Overachievers to get up, get out and go do that thing they really want to do.

The “It Might As Well Be You” campaign includes Essentia’s first-ever national television spots that will be aired during key broadcast moments like the Billboard Music Awards and day one of the NFL Draft. In addition to Mahomes, the spot features Ezinma, a hip-hop violinist known as Classical Bae; Danielle Guizio, a fashion designer and stylist; and Julian Rodarte, an award-winning chef. These Overachievers embody the essence of Essentia’s campaign and what it means to be resilient and make their “thing” happen.

“Essentia believes in helping people follow their passion through better hydration,” said Karyn Abrahamson, CMO at Essentia. “Our campaign ‘It Might As Well Be You’ truly underscores that belief and the overachiever’s journey to pursue their dream and not give up. The message is personal, empowering and demonstrates what Essentia and our core consumer both value – the power of resilience.”

The campaign created in partnership with Essentia’s lead creative agency Droga5, and directed by young filmmaker Matt Lambert, includes 60, 30, 15 and 06 second spots, as well as over 10 films for digital/social content, experiential and 131 out-of-home placements.

Over the last several years, the New York City-based brand has established a place for itself in the competitive market for plant-based protein bars and powders. In moving into beverage this spring with the launch of a three-SKU line of RTD protein drinks, Aloha CEO Brad Charron told BevNET the launch is a long-planned piece of the company’s strategy to “make sure the latent potential of [Aloha] is realized.”

“We knew that beverages are an important aspect of any food company,” he said. “We wanted to make sure the rest of the business was on strong footing so we would be able to invest in getting trial of the drinks.”

Charron, a former brand manager at PepsiCo and a senior VP of marketing at Chobani during that brand’s initial foray into beverages, has experience launching drink products. In the case of Aloha, the brand’s established principles helped dictate the direction of the protein line’s development. Like its protein bars, Aloha’s protein drinks are organic, vegan, non-GMO, and free from gluten, dairy and artificial ingredients. The company is seeking to highlight the use of a coconut milk base and the addition of prebiotics, and electrolytes and MCT oil from coconuts.

The line — available in chocolate sea salt, coconut and vanilla varieties — contains 18 g of a proprietary pea and brown rice-based protein blend and is sweetened with monk fruit. The products will be sold in 4-packs (MSRP $14.99) and single bottles, and are available in 12-packs on Amazon.

“It was a combination of mandatories, then going into R&D and figuring out how can we execute this to the best of our abilities and to the point where we really feel we have something truly unique in a market that’s very crowded,” Charron said.

Aloha’s move into beverage isn’t its first experience with drinks, however; the company previously marketed dry tea sachets. Yet it does set the brand up to compete in an increasingly competitive field of plant-based protein drinks. In recent years, plant-based beverage brands such as Ripple, REBBL, Koia, OWYN and Cytosport (via Evolve brand) have emerged as notable names in the segment.",Aloha Launches Plant-Based Protein Drink

In keeping with their roots, Hanson sources their Meyer lemons locally from DMS Ranch, an organic, family-owned Meyer lemon farm located just 25 miles from Hanson’s Sonoma distillery. Hanson of Sonoma infuses the zest from fresh Meyer lemon peels (which are sweeter and less acidic than traditional lemons) into the vodka, where the oils from the zest give the vodka a bright, citrus zing. The resulting Meyer lemon vodka has notes of spicy bergamot, herbs and just a kick of spice – perfect for a fresh take on the classic Lemon Drop, or a summery cocktail. Each bottle of Hanson of Sonoma vodka retails for $30.

Hanson of Sonoma has also opened a new tasting room in Sausalito, just a short ferry ride or drive across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. The tasting room serves handcrafted cocktails made with Hanson of Sonoma vodka and offers tastings of Hanson of Sonoma’s mainstay flavors – Original, Cucumber, Ginger, Mandarin, Habanero and Meyer Lemon – and special edition flavors like Boysenberry and Espresso. Hanson of Sonoma’s new tasting room is located at 669 Bridgeway within the Hanson Gallery Fine Art. The tasting room is open on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays from 12 – 6 p.m. Starting in May, the Sausalito tasting room will be open seven days a week from 12 – 7 p.m.

Additionally, Hanson’s vodkas were featured in the April 2019 “Love the Planet” issue of O, The Oprah Magazine. The full lineup of flavors was included in “The O List” roundup of sustainable and eco-friendly products.

Hanson of Sonoma is a family-owned small-batch organic vodka distillery. Owned and operated by four siblings – Chris, Brandon, Alanna and Darren – and their parents Scott and Judy, Hanson of Sonoma makes 100 percent organic vodka from grapes and uses only real ingredients to infuse each flavor which currently includes Original, Cucumber, Ginger, Mandarin, Habañero and Meyer Lemon. In July 2018, four years after their launch, Hanson opened up a tasting room in the Los Carneros Appellation of Sonoma. A first of its kind in Wine Country, the tasting room offers a unique experience to visitors that, in addition to vodka flights and expertly-crafted cocktails, also offers educational courses like Martini and caviar pairings or vodka infusion courses. Hanson of Sonoma’s distillery is located at 22986 Burndale Road in Sonoma, CA. The tasting room is open every day from 11am – 5 p.m. In spring 2019, Hanson of Sonoma opened their second tasting room in Sausalito, CA. This tasting room, located within the Hanson Gallery Fine Art at 669 Bridgeway, is open on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from 12 – 6 p.m. More information can be found at HansonofSonoma.com","Hanson of Sonoma Launches New Meyer Lemon Flavor, Opens Sausalito Tasting Room"
"Facing a sustained double digit decline in beverage sales, The Fresh Market’s director of grocery Dwight Richmond knew the retailer needed something more than the standard category reset to fix its issues.",2019-04-8,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/08180627/Fresh-Market_Full-Width.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/fresh-start-fresh-market-plots-beverage-overhaul,"Facing a sustained double digit decline in beverage sales, The Fresh Market’s director of grocery Dwight Richmond knew the retailer needed something more than the standard category reset to fix its issues.

Last month Richmond, a former Whole Foods purchasing coordinator who joined The Fresh Market in December, put into motion his plan to turn around the massive drop in beverage sales for its 161 stores. In an industry wide email to brands, Richmond declared that “no one is safe in this review” and laid out a new strategy to modernize the North Carolina-based retailer’s offerings. He told BevNET this week his plans including eliminating crossover between brands in the cold case and the ambient shelf, redefining categories, emphasizing functional beverages, and scaling back on sugary carbonated soft drinks (CSD).

“As I told my team, the foundation of the road of beverage at The Fresh Market is lined with patches from potholes of failures past,” Richmond said. “So what I have to do is jackhammer the whole category apart and lay a new foundation, and not just put a patch over a patch.”

According to Richmond, the main source of The Fresh Market’s declining beverage sales was its own failure to keep up-to-date with consumer trends. He noted the retailer had gone as many as 18 months without an active reset; The company is now aiming to reset its functional beverage cooler on May 22, while the rest of its beverage sets are scheduled to reset on June 19.

The refrigerated functional beverage set — which includes “live” products such as kombucha, water kefirs, and switchels — was finalized two weeks ago. Additional categories will begin being reviewed this week. Commenting on his decision to take a Richmond “no one is safe” approach to the reset, Richmond said the company cut back on products from kombucha category leader GT’s Living Foods, and said that larger brands, like Fiji Water, will have to submit samples and compete alongside startups.

With limited shelf space compared to its larger competitors, The Fresh Market is also drawing a harder line between cold case brands and those on the ambient dry shelf. Richmond cited a need for a greater diversity of products and is now requiring brands to pick between the two sections.

Calling it the “Manhattan real estate” of the store where “every inch” matters, Richmond said the cold cooler will be reserved for high performance brands willing to “pay to play” and provide tactical promotional support. But the retailer also plans to treat the dry shelf as an incubator, where brands that show strong velocities can eventually graduate to cold case.

“If we look at the cold case as Manhattan real estate, do we look at the ambient shelf as The Bronx? Well, everybody’s looking at The Bronx as the new Manhattan,” he said. “So it isn’t that we look at it differently, it’s just that program wise, support wise, mix wise I almost want to look at the ambient shelf as an incubator stage for what could be cold case. I want to be more risk taking in my ambient shelving than I am today.”

Part of the new segmentation includes redefining the carbonated drink category. Single-serve canned sparkling waters, for example, will be moved out of the water segment and into the CSD set. Excluding Coca-Cola Company products, The Fresh Market will also cut back the amount of traditional CSDs in order to make space for healthier options, with an emphasis on zero calorie and fruit-sweetened products.

“Our consumers are screaming at us that sparkling water is the new soda, so why don’t we treat it like the new soda and why don’t we merchandise accordingly,” Richmond said. “So we’re going to be questioning a lot the rules and redefining them based on our consumers very clear purchasing habits and very clear demands.”

For the water section, Richmond plans to focus on high quality products with sustainable packaging, citing JUST Water as one potential brand. Though canned sparkling waters will move to the CSD section, premium glass-packaged sparkling waters will remain in the water space.

In the functional set, Richmond said the company is preparing to add 40 new products, including national and regional brands. In addition to “live beverages” like kombucha and adaptogenic teas, Fresh Market is also carving out space for coffee, energy drinks, and plant-based waters. For functional products in particular, Richmond was sure to have a variety of flavor profiles while also making the effort to select products that appear to have staying power beyond flash-in-the-pan trends. He also researched and recruited specific brands to round out the set, one example being plant-based superfood smoothie KiiTO.

“We’re looking at syndicated data, looking at cutting data, look at each brand’s own internal data and ranking, we’re going to arrive at a conclusion to create a new and improved beverage section at The Fresh Market,” he said. “But the response has been great. And what I’m seeing is that people are excited that we’re out to make a difference here.”",Fresh Start: Fresh Market Plots Beverage Overhaul

The unique taste of Bacardi rum inspired cocktail pioneers to invent some of the world’s most famous recipes including the Bacardi Mojito, the Bacardi Daiquirí, the Bacardi Cuba Libre, the Bacardi Piña Colada and the Bacardi El Presidente. Bacardi rum is the world’s most awarded spirit, with more than 800 awards for quality, taste and innovation. Today, Bacardi rum is made mainly in Puerto Rico where it is crafted to ensure the taste remains the same today as it did when it was first blended in 1862. Visit bacardi.com.

"Following the global acclaim of their beaver castoreum-infused whiskey, Eau de Musc, Steven Grasse (the creator of the Hendrick’s Gin and Sailor Jerry Rum brands) and his talented team at Tamworth Distilling and Mercantile are excited to announce their next incredible experiment in the “House of Tamworth” line: Lait de Romalea (“Milk of Grasshopper”).",2019-04-9,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/09111415/538658743.lait_.romalea.2-208x320.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/spirits/2019/tamworth-distilling-unveils-new-grasshopper-milk-bourbon/,"TAMWORTH, N.H.– Following the global acclaim of their beaver castoreum-infused whiskey, Eau de Musc, Steven Grasse (the creator of the Hendrick’s Gin and Sailor Jerry Rum brands) and his talented team at Tamworth Distilling and Mercantile are excited to announce their next incredible experiment in the “House of Tamworth” line: Lait de Romalea (“Milk of Grasshopper”).

Lait de Romalea is a new, 90-proof bourbon whiskey infused with the foam (or milk) excreted as a defense mechanism from the Easter Lubber grasshopper. The result is a surprisingly delightful bourbon with a unique floral, rosy, and fruity nose and plum, berry, and subtle tobacco notes on the palate. The new release will be available for national purchase for a limited time through Warehouse Wines & Spirits.

Lait de Romalea is the result of Tamworth Distilling’s continued experimentation with unusual flavor sources. In this case, it’s the brown, Skoal-like exudate of the Eastern Lubber grasshopper. The romalea exudate is extracted through a process similar to how snakes are milked for anti-venom, where tactile stimulation of the abdomen with the thumb and forefinger will elicit the secretion discharge.

“Working at the chemical level, we found that this malodorous stuff is composed of a type of molecule that is a precursor to the ones that give roses (and bourbon) their deep, enriching scent. To unlock this pleasant quality, the grasshopper foam is first milked, then fermented with wilted tea leaves, whose enzymes prep the smelly substance for an acidic distillation that completes the chemical rearrangement…The final product is the desirable aroma molecule, beta-damascenone. The result is infused in our bourbon to create supercharged aromatic note,” explained Tamworth Distilling lead distiller and resident chemist, Matt Power.

After the exudate is extracted and fermented with black tea leaves, the liquid is refluxed in acidic ethanol to instill the final chemical rearrangements prior to infusion. At this point, the dehydrated extraction is infused into Tamworth Distilling’s signature bourbon and is ready for consumption.

Tamworth Distilling’s Lait de Romalea will be available for a limited time through online retailer Warehouse Wines & Spirits for $75/bottle starting April 1, 2019. For more information, please visit tamworthdistilling.com or follow us on Instagram at @tamworth_distilling.

"— New Age Beverages Corporation, the Colorado and Utah-based organic and natural beverage company intending to become the world’s leading healthy beverages and lifestyles company, has announced the distribution expansion of their Marley brand with Walmart, the world’s largest retailer.",2019-04-9,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/09131738/nSSN4kL5_400x400.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/new-age-beverages-corporation-expands-with-walmart,"DENVER— New Age Beverages Corporation, the Colorado and Utah-based organic and natural beverage company intending to become the world’s leading healthy beverages and lifestyles company, has announced the distribution expansion of their Marley brand with Walmart, the world’s largest retailer.

Following a complete redevelopment of the Marley portfolio following the acquisition by New Age in mid-2017, which included the development and launch of Organic Marley Mate and Marley Cold Brew, the Marley brand was one of the New Age’s leading brands in growth in 2018 with increased demand of more than 70 percent. Marley Mate led its segment and drove category growth, and the resurgence of the Marley Mellow Mood Relaxation Drinks following its remake has paved the way for the launch of Marley Mellow Mood + CBD, which is launching globally in 2019.

Marley Mate, an organic yerba mate beverage, is grown in the subtropical rainforests of South America. It is a natural energy drink that has the taste of tea with the uplift of coffee without the crash. Marley (yerba) Mate, pronounced yer·​ba ma·​té, is consumed more than six to one over coffee in many South American countries, and according to Healthline, ”…is rich in antioxidants, xanthines, and polyphenols.”

Marley Mate comes in three flavors, Be Jammin’ Berry, Ya Mon Mint and Jamaican Me Mango. New Age’s Marley Mate has the lowest-sugar, lowest-calorie, and lowest-carbohydrate yerba mate of all major competitors. The brand outsold all competitors per point of distribution in 2018, which contributed to the decision by Walmart to authorize the brand. Each of the flavors which will be available at Walmart stores in the beginning of April.

Craig Thibodeau, VP of key accounts for New Age stated, “This is such a great accomplishment for New Age to gain its first national distribution, and to do so with the world’s largest retailer in Walmart. This is just the first initiative that we expect to do with them on the Marley brand and other New Age products on which we are in active discussions. We know Walmart is equally as committed as New Age to providing healthier products for their customers, and we expect to make the full portfolio of New Age’s better-for-you products available as we expand the relationship.”

New Age will be dedicating significant marketing efforts behind its Marley brand in 2019 to build on what it sees as a significant opportunity with consumers, utilizing a full suite of social and digital assets beginning in late April. Following initial shipment to distribution centers this month, stores are given two weeks to set the shelves. Across Walmart stores New Age will be running hyper-targeted GeoFraming campaigns to drive foot traffic at the store level, encouraging pull-through with digital couponing, awareness and trial campaigns.

New Age Beverages Corporation is a Colorado and Utah-based healthy beverage company dedicated to inspiring and educating consumers to live healthy. The Company is the only one-stop-shop of healthy beverages and includes the brands Tahitian Noni, TeMana, Búcha Live Kombucha, XingTea, Coco-Libre, Marley, and others.

"The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association are introducing new policy recommendations to limit kids’ and teens’ access to sugary drinks, according to ",2019-04-9,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/09160147/SugaryBev_fullwidth.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/press-clips-physicians-call-for-regulation-on-kids-access-to-sugary-drinks,"The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association are introducing new policy recommendations to limit kids’ and teens’ access to sugary drinks, according to CNN.

On March 25, the physicians’ groups released a public policy recommendation published in the journal Pediatrics, stating that “Excess consumption of added sugars, especially from sugary drinks, contributes to the high prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity.” They also noted how excess sugar consumption increases the risk of health issues such as dental decay, cardiovascular disease and hypertension.

The recommendations included: an excise tax to increase the shelf price of sugary drinks; support from federal and state governments in decreasing sugary drink marketing to adolescents; ensuring that federal nutrition assistance programs such as WIC provide access to healthy foods; added sugar content listing on menus and advertisements; policies which make healthy drinks the default in vending machines and restaurants; and hospitals limiting or disincentivizing buying sugary drinks.

“We have tried, and failed, to curb sugary drink intake through education and individual choices alone,” Dr. Natalie Muth, a pediatrician and registered dietitian who was lead author of the statement, told CNN. “Just like policy changes were necessary and effective in reducing consumption of tobacco and alcohol, we need policy changes that will help reduce sugary drink consumption in children and adolescents.”

William Dermody, spokesperson for the American Beverage Association (ABA), responded to the policy recommendations, telling CNN, “America’s beverage companies believe there’s a better way to help reduce the amount of sugar consumers get from beverages and it includes putting parents in the driver’s seat to decide what’s best for their children.”

Dermody also stated the ABA supports making healthy beverages like water or milk the default beverage for kids’ menus, and noted that 50 percent of all beverages currently sold have no sugar.

Soft drink companies and lobbyists working on their behalf have spent $11.8 million over the past two years to block proposals of sugary beverage taxes and health warnings on their packaging, according to California Healthline. The paper reported that those expenditures included gift and perks for state lawmakers, including tickets to sports games and a free screening of “Black Panther.”

In February, the LA Times reported that California lawmakers proposed a bill to tax sugary sodas and ban the sale of oversized sodas, such as 7-Eleven’s signature “Big Gulp,” to address what they called a “public health crisis.” Several other states are considering imposing similar taxes.

California Healthline found that “9 in 10 state senators and members of the Assembly, or a member of their staff, accepted a campaign contribution, gift or charitable donation in 2017 and 2018 from the American Beverage Association (or its political action committee), the Coca-Cola Co. or PepsiCo — the three largest givers in the industry.”

Last year, as more soda taxes were proposed in California, soda companies spent $8.9 million supporting a ballot measure to make it more difficult to impose any new taxes in the state, which extended beyond beverages. Lawmakers then banned local soda taxes until Jan. 1, 2031 if the companies dropped the ballot proposal.

In an email response to California Healthline, ABA VP William Dermody Jr. wrote: “It’s important to inform lawmakers about the contributions that our products make to the local economy, not only the millions in tax revenues we generate for the state but the wages we bolster for hundreds of thousands of California workers.”

A judge has allowed a lawsuit to move forward which contends that Nestle Waters’s Poland Spring “100% Natural Spring Water” doesn’t come from a spring, according to the New York Times.

The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court in Connecticut, claims that the water which Poland Spring sources is actually mislabeled common groundwater. A similar class-action lawsuit was filed against Poland Spring in 2003.

The lawsuit “seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages as well as a permanent injunction preventing Nestlé Waters from continuing the alleged fraud,” according to NYT.

The lawsuit also claims that the titular spring in Maine actually dried up 50 years ago, and that the company created man-made springs to comply with the law.

Nestle Waters North America claims that last year, an independent investigation “confirmed that Poland Spring Brand spring water sources meet all F.D.A. regulations defining spring water.”

“Consumers can be confident in the accuracy of the labels on every bottle of Poland Spring, and that Poland Spring Brand natural spring water is just what it says it is — 100 percent natural spring water,” Nestle Waters said in a statement on March 29.

Resident Advisor reported last week that employees of Red Bull Music Academy (RBMA) and Red Bull Radio were informed late last month that the entities will shut down effective October 31.

Red Bull is ending its partnership with consulting firm Yadastar, which oversaw RMBA and Red Bull Radio. Red Bull Music and Red Bull Music Festival, not associated with Yadastar, will continue.

“Red Bull will be moving away from a strongly centralized approach, will gradually phase out the existing structure and will implement a new setup which empowers existing Red Bull country teams and utilizes local expertise,” Red Bull told Resident Advisor in a statement. “Red Bull will continue to explore new ways to support promising and cutting-edge artists wherever they may be.”

The company did not comment on how many jobs will be lost as a result of this decision.

RBMA hosted lectures, workshops and concerts across the world, ran a daily digital publication and provided musicians access to high quality music equipment.

Yadastar posted a statement on its Twitter account on April 3 confirming that it had “mutually agreed to part ways” with Red Bull and thanking its employees.

RBMA celebrated its 20th anniversary last year in Berlin. Several artists, journalists and labels took to Twitter following the announcement to react to the news.

Arizona Beverages was the target of a ransomware attack on March 21, Tech Crunch reported, and the company is still recovering.

During the attack, the screens on over 200 of the company’s servers and networked computers lit up with the message “Your network was hacked and encrypted.” Employees were also instructed to hand in their possibly compromised laptops.

A source told Tech Crunch that Arizona brought in incident responders five days after the attack, after discovering its backup system wasn’t working properly and that the company was running outdated Windows operating systems. According to the source, the responders claimed the company’s system “had been compromised for at least a couple of months.”

Several weeks prior, the FBI warned the company of a possible Dridex malware infection, which is sent through an email attachment and allows attackers access to network traffic and passwords. Responders believed this infection to be the cause of the ransomware attack.

In response, Arizona spent “hundreds of thousands” on new hardware, according to the source. The attack left the company unable to process orders for a week, costing millions in lost sales. The company is still recovering from the attack and is about “60 percent up and running,” the source said.",Press Clips: Physicians Call for Regulation on Kids’ Access to Sugary Drinks

Smith is the founder and CEO of Simple Mills, a brand of natural baking mixes, crackers and cookies, that she launched in 2013. Over the past six years, Simple Mills has become one of the leading natural brands in the spaces in which it plays. Its products are distributed in over 13,000 conventional and natural grocery stores including Whole Foods, Sprouts, Target, Kroger and Safeway. Smith was named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 Class of 2017 and based on what you’ll hear in our interview, it’s easy to understand why. Smith spoke about the origins of Simple Mills, how she assessed the opportunity for a better-for-you baking mix brand, what her first year was like and her definition of entrepreneurial commitment.

Carrington Farms, a leading brand of organic seeds and cooking ingredients, actually started out as a tea company.

How, one might ask, does he plan on doing that? Simple. A lot of soap and a dash of psychedelics.

Since Bronner took the reins of his family’s business in 1998, Dr. Bronner’s has become the top-selling brand of natural soaps in North America. The company, which also markets natural toothpaste, lip balm, shaving cream and coconut oil, generated $122 million in sales in 2018, over 30 times its revenue when Bronner took over.

Dr. Bronner’s, which was founded as a non-profit, religious organization dedicated to world peace, has used that growth to fuel its advocacy for social and environmental causes. The company has donated tens of millions of dollars into efforts supporting GMO transparency, the integration of cannabis and psychedelic drugs into American medicine, and regenerative organic agriculture.

As part of a wide-ranging interview included in this episode, Bronner spoke about his roots with the natural soap company and how his advocacy for hemp contributed to the evolution of the brand. He also explained why he supports the use of psychedelics within the context of the company’s philanthropic strategy, discussed what makes Dr. Bronner’s concept of corporate responsibility different, and how it is preserving its legacy.",Ep. 156: Why Psychedelics and Soap Might Just Save the World

Although Primal Kitchen was on the market for just over three years when it was acquired, the brand, which was born out of Sisson’s popular blog, was decades in the making.

In an interview included in this episode, Sisson spoke about his background as an entrepreneur and how his experience in direct-to-consumer sales paved the way for his blog and help lay the foundation for Primal Kitchen. Sisson also discussed effective techniques for communicating with modern consumers and why he views Kraft Heinz as the perfect partner.

In an interview recorded at Natural Products Expo West 2019, Sisson spoke with NOSH editor Carol Ortenberg about the variety of business he founded early in his career and why he launched his blog, Mark’s Daily Apple, in 2006. He also explained why the blog became so influential within the health and wellness community and how it provided Primal Kitchen with a smooth path to Whole Foods. Sisson also discussed the competitive landscape for Paleo foods and how Primal Kitchen is attempting to separate itself from the pack.

The brand, which was launched in 2014 by Select Milk Producers in collaboration with Coke, anticipates the $200 million facility will be online by the second half of 2020.

Fairlife currently has manufacturing facilities in Michigan and Texas. Estimating that across its entire product portfolio the brand is “available in at least 75 percent of the available outlets in the country,” COO Tim Doelman told BevNET the new facility will help the company go deeper in the West Coast and Southwest regions, expand its product mix with existing customers, and further grow its retail market penetration nationwide.

“Arizona is a very pro-business state with a great labor force,” Doelman said. “We’re super happy about the location in Goodyear and to work with the local communities there to move forward. The state has been incredibly receptive to our business, so it was a really simple decision for us. It’s an optimal location to service the West Coast and still expand the footprint in a super economical way from the supply chain side of things.”

The facility is expected to create more than 140 local jobs and is located in proximity to dairy farms in order to streamline the supply chain. The company will partner with the United Dairymen of Arizona co-op to work directly with farmers.

Doelman added that the plant’s location is well positioned geographically for an eventual international expansion into Mexico and Pacific Rim nations.

“We’ll have a great source of milk that is competitive,” he said. “It’s healthy for the business and healthy for the farmers, who we know are going to be here for the next 20, 30, 40 years.”

In addition to its core “Ultra-Filtered” milk products, Fairlife also markets a number of functional lines including protein shake Core Power, better-for-you Smart Snacks, and the newly launched Nutrition Plan, which contains added vitamins and nutrients. Doelman said the added production capacity gives the brand more space to develop new innovations which will “come out over the next couple of years.”

While the facility will primarily manufacture Fairlife products, Doelman said it may also be used to manufacture other Coke aligned products “that are along the same type” of beverages as Fairlife, but will not be equipped to make carbonated soft drinks. Fairlife is a part of TCCC’s Venturing and Emerging Brands (VEB) unit.

“We really work across a platform of groups within Coke to leverage their insights that they have on the selling side, the marketing side, and we combine that with our expertise in the supply chain and farming side that The Select Group brought to the table,” Doelman said. “It makes for a powerful combination of assets that we’re able to leverage in the marketplace.”",Fairlife to Open $200 Million Production Facility in Arizona
"Aloha, a pioneer in the plant-based protein industry, has announced the launch of its newest innovation, a protein drink.

Available in three delicious flavors, Chocolate Sea Salt, Coconut and Vanilla, the convenient and nutritious protein drinks provide 18 g of protein with only 5 g of coconut sugar. The protein drinks are another way that Aloha is providing plant-based goodness one day at a time.

Unlike other products on the market, the new protein drinks contain a unique blend of electrolytes to replenish nutrients, prebiotics for improved gut health and MCT oil derived from coconuts for natural energy and endurance. The drinks are low-net carb, making it keto-friendly and contain low-sugar and no sugar alcohols. Aloha’s protein drink uses a proprietary blend of pea and brown rice proteins and has a creamy coconut milk base which is smooth and satiating. The drinks are complete with whole food ingredients for optimal nutrition and digestion, leaving consumers with a clean and satisfying experience.

“When discussing a concept for a plant-based protein drink with our small team of employee-owners at Aloha, we knew there were a few things consumers had often complained about with other protein beverages on the market – they’re chalky, too thick, have a ton of ingredients that people don’t recognize and don’t like (like stevia)…and they just feel like a gut bomb,” said Aloha CEO, Brad Charron. “At Aloha, our mission and only focus is to craft real plant-based food that tastes delicious and has nourishing ingredients – people shouldn’t have to sacrifice taste or the quality of ingredients they’re putting into their bodies. The introduction of coconut milk to a shelf-stable protein drink is a first in the category and creates a creamy, smooth texture and complements the flavors of the drinks. We’re thrilled to share this with our customers.”

Like Aloha’s product portfolio of plant-based protein bars and powders, the protein drinks are certified USDA organic, vegan, non-GMO and contain nothing artificial. They are also free from gluten, soy, dairy and stevia.

The new protein drinks are available today at Target and Aloha.com, and will be available soon on Amazon, with additional distribution to follow soon at Harris Teeter, Publix, Hy-Vee, and in Albertsons and Safeway divisions.

Aloha’s mission is to make healthy living simple and accessible to everyone through clean, organic, plant-based food. With a focus on our protein powder, protein bars and protein drinks, Ahola creates organic products meant to be savored and enjoyed without sacrificing taste or nutrition. Every item is formulated to the highest standard, nutrient-rich, and thoughtfully packaged with deep respect for both people and the environment. Ahola is currently available at Amazon, Target, Kroger, HEB, Central Market, Harris Teeter, Wegmans, Hy-Vee, Stop & Shop, Thrive Market and many others.

"– The Granny Squibb Company has announced that in the wake of growth, Jamie Schapiro will join the team as CEO and Emma Haskell as project manager.",2019-04-10,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/10130028/613ad7bcbf260be1b820.png,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/granny-squibb-company-expands-team-hires-ceo-and-project-manager,"PROVIDENCE, R.I.– The Granny Squibb Company has announced that in the wake of growth, Jamie Schapiro will join the team as CEO and Emma Haskell as project manager.

“This is a very exciting time for The Granny Squibb Company and as we look to grow and expand our presence in RhodeIsland this year. Jamie and Emma bring another level of experience and man power that will help us meet our business goals and to make Granny Squibb’s Organic Iced Tea a household name,” said Kelley McShane, partner of The Granny Squibb Company.

In early 2019, the team retained Aperture, a business consulting firm founded and lead by Jamie Schapiro to evaluate the company and build a business plan that would lay the foundation for further growth. Following development of the business plan, the team found great value in Schapiro’s experience and retained him as CEO.

He has more than two decades of experience successfully driving the development, launch and growth of differentiated consumer goods and services at industry-leading start-ups such as Jamba Juice, Clif Bar and Premama; and mature companies like Stirrings, Galaxy Nutritional Foods and TriNet made him a perfect fit.

Emma Haskell will assume the full-time role of project manager, following a part-time position since summer 2018. As project manager she will oversee social media, research, event coordination and planning, product demos, website development and assist with ongoing projects.

A combination of her education at UMass Amherst and more than eight years working in the hospitality and beverage industry has provided her with the real-world tools to elevate The Granny Squibb Company in the community.

Over the next year, the team will focus mainly on growth in Rhode Island and New England. Their first priorities include further engaging with current retailers including Dave’s Marketplace, Whole Foods, Roch’s, Wegmans and other local stores while looking to grow their presence in restaurants, coffee shops and farmer’s markets.

In 2009, Robin Squibb realized a business opportunity in bringing her grandmother’s “astonishingly delicious” iced tea to market. Founded in Providence, Rhode Island the company now offers three distinct flavors – all available sweetened or unsweetened. Granny Squibb’s organic iced teas are sold in grocery retailers throughout New England including Dave’s Marketplace, Wegmans, Roch’s and Whole Foods.

In addition to Wegmans and selected New York stores Hälsa is now also available at ShopRite, Fresh Direct and at all three New York City airports through grab-and-go retailers and kiosks.

“Consumers and retailers have really responded to Hälsa’s super clean-label qualities, and we’re opening new doors at a fast phase,” says company co-founder and CEO Mika Manninen.

Hälsa — Swedish for health — is the world’s first dairy-free yogurt made without a single artificial ingredient. The probiotic yogurt is manufactured with a new proprietary technology that company co-founders Helena Lumme and Mika Manninen spent four years developing.

“Whole grain oats are one of the healthiest grains, yet most oat milks out there are not much more than fortified water. We cracked the code by developing a new manufacturing process that keeps all the nutritional benefits intact,” said company president Helena Lumme.

Hälsa raises the bar for the plant-based milk category by eliminating all food additives and chemicals from the manufacturing process and recipe: No enzymes are used to alter the grain during process, and the product is free of gums, emulsifiers, phosphates and processed sugar that compromise gut health.

Hälsa’s 100 percent clean label promise includes sustainably grown, glyphosate-free ingredients. Its source of oats is Scandinavia’s Oat Valley where the grains are carefully grown, harvested and dried in a way that avoids the use of the mold-preventing sprays omnipresent in Canada and the U.S. “Having our own clean source of organic oats becomes a more important factor as more US-made oat products test positive for glyphosate,” Lumme added.

In 2011 Lumme and Manninen were the first to introduce oat milks to the U.S. Despite winning a spate of innovation and taste awards at the time, they went back to the drawing board knowing that consumers deserved a far superior and healthier product that they believe will set an important new standard for all others.

Dairy and soy-free, Hälsa Organic Oatgurt is available in four great fruit flavors — Organic Strawberry, Organic Blueberry, Organic Mango Pear and Organic Concord Grape. The product line is rare among plant-based beverages in that it boasts both pre- and probiotics, no added sugar, and only 120-130 calories per bottle, with a suggested retail price of $2.99 per 8 oz. bottle. Hälsa can be found at Wegman’s, leading independent health food retailers and via Fresh Direct in New York City and at New York City airports.","Hälsa Oat Yogurt Expands to Fresh Direct, ShopRite and NYC Airports"

Driven by the trends behind Industry 4.0, and with code generation, digital printing and data management at its core, the connected packaging platform will bring new benefits to food producers, retailers and shoppers.

For producers, the new packaging platform will offer end-to-end traceability to improve the production of the product, quality control and supply chain transparency. It will have the ability to track and trace the history or location of any product, making it possible to monitor for market performance and any potential issues.

For retailers, it will offer greater supply chain visibility and real-time insights, enabling distributors to track stock movements, be alerted when issues occur, and monitor for delivery performance.

For shoppers, it will mean the ability to access vast amounts of information such as where the product was made, the farm that the ingredients came from and where the package can be recycled.

Ivan Nesterenko, VP, cross portfolio at Tetra Pak said: “We are unlocking new opportunities for our customers to get more value from packaging than even before. No longer is it only about product protection and functionality, it is about connectivity. The future of packaging is undoubtedly digital: this launch is a step towards a truly intelligent package, and we are excited to collaborate with our customers on this journey.”

Tetra Pak has successfully completed pilots with its customers to test the new connected package and its performance in retail in Spain, Russia, China, the Dominican Republic and India, working with beverage, juice and milk producers.

Smith is the founder and CEO of Simple Mills, a brand of natural baking mixes, crackers and cookies, that she launched in 2013. Over the past six years, Simple Mills has become one of the leading natural brands in the spaces in which it plays. Its products are distributed in over 13,000 conventional and natural grocery stores including Whole Foods, Sprouts, Target, Kroger and Safeway. Smith was named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 Class of 2017 and based on what you’ll hear in our interview, it’s easy to understand why. Smith spoke about the origins of Simple Mills, how she assessed the opportunity for a better-for-you baking mix brand, what her first year was like and her definition of entrepreneurial commitment.

Carrington Farms, a leading brand of organic seeds and cooking ingredients, actually started out as a tea company. Founder and CEO David Eben discussed the brand’s evolution and how its portfolio has grown over the years.

How, one might ask, does he plan on doing that? Simple. A lot of soap and a dash of psychedelics.

Since Bronner took the reins of his family’s business in 1998, Dr. Bronner’s has become the top-selling brand of natural soaps in North America. The company, which also markets natural toothpaste, lip balm, shaving cream and coconut oil, generated $122 million in sales in 2018, over 30 times its revenue when Bronner took over.

Dr. Bronner’s, which was founded as a non-profit, religious organization dedicated to world peace, has used that growth to fuel its advocacy for social and environmental causes. The company has donated tens of millions of dollars into efforts supporting GMO transparency, the integration of cannabis and psychedelic drugs into American medicine, and regenerative organic agriculture.

As part of a wide-ranging interview included in this episode, Bronner spoke about his roots with the natural soap company and how his advocacy for hemp contributed to the evolution of the brand. He also explained why he supports the use of psychedelics within the context of the company’s philanthropic strategy, discussed what makes Dr. Bronner’s concept of corporate responsibility different, and how it is preserving its legacy.",Ep. 156: Why Psychedelics and Soap Might Just Save the World

Although Primal Kitchen was on the market for just over three years when it was acquired, the brand, which was born out of Sisson’s popular blog, was decades in the making.

In an interview included in this episode, Sisson spoke about his background as an entrepreneur and how his experience in direct-to-consumer sales paved the way for his blog and help lay the foundation for Primal Kitchen. Sisson also discussed effective techniques for communicating with modern consumers and why he views Kraft Heinz as the perfect partner.

In an interview recorded at Natural Products Expo West 2019, Sisson spoke with NOSH editor Carol Ortenberg about the variety of business he founded early in his career and why he launched his blog, Mark’s Daily Apple, in 2006. He also explained why the blog became so influential within the health and wellness community and how it provided Primal Kitchen with a smooth path to Whole Foods. Sisson also discussed the competitive landscape for Paleo foods and how Primal Kitchen is attempting to separate itself from the pack.

"When it comes to kombucha, GT Dave is certainly the biggest dog in the pack. So when he appeared to take a few conspicuous swipes at some of his company’s rising competitors in a recent magazine article, the industry took notice.",2019-05-23,https://dz37geo4xxuha.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GTDave_970.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/forbes-fallout-health-ade-kevita-react-to-gts-feature-story,"When it comes to kombucha, GT Dave is certainly the biggest dog in the pack. So when he appeared to take a few conspicuous swipes at some of his company’s rising competitors in a recent magazine article, the industry took notice.

In the article, published on May 9, Dave, the founder and CEO of GT’s Living Foods, sat down with Forbes reporter Chloe Sorvino at his Beverly Hills mansion for a deep dive into the making of his kombucha empire. The story and the accompanying video featured Dave musing on a wide swath of topics, ranging from growing up in L.A. to the fallout of the 2010 Whole Foods fermentation recall debacle to his insistence on not skimming out yeast and bacteria from his products (“This is what the customer wants,” he noted).

However, it’s Dave’s pointed comments about two of his chief rivals for category dominance, namely KeVita and Health-Ade, that have generated the most reaction within the industry in the days since the article was published. Having been “instrumental in allowing (the category) to be what it is,” Dave told Forbes kombucha was in now in danger of “slowly being killed by all the noise and all the success.”

According to the article, Dave cited Health-Ade as an example of a brand that has “bastardized” kombucha by pushing its flavor profile too far towards the mainstream. “You know what they are?… Cherry-berry. Tropical punch… [they] make it basic, make it mainstream.”

“If your claim to fame is that you’re in amber bottles, or you’re three cool hipsters behind this product, and that’s it?” Dave said. “Your days are numbered, in my opinion.”

That comment — which could easily be interpreted as a reference to Health-Ade — sparked that company’s co-founder, Daina Trout, to respond via social media earlier this week. In a LinkedIn post, Trout wrote it was a “disappointment to read wildly inaccurate and below-the-belt comments” by Dave in the Forbes story. Naturally, users commenting on the post fueled a further taking of sides on issues related to kombucha formulation, investment, pricing and more. Dave himself weighed in on the post, briefly; the responses have since been removed.

Speaking with BevNET last week, Health-Ade co-founder Diana Trout said she was “disappointed” and “surprised” by such a direct callout of her brand.

“I think it’s safe to say if anybody was in my position they would probably be disappointed,” she said. “Competition is the best sign of a category that has legs. To me, it’s really a good thing.”

Trout said Dave’s comments in the article were “out of the blue,” noting that both of their brands have been “pretty active” in Kombucha Brewers International (KBI), a California-based industry trade group. “The last two years have been healthfully competitive and very professional,” she said.

Trout also defended Health-Ade against accusations, made in the since deleted posts, that the company had hired away talent from GT’s Living Foods. She denied that the company has ever employed someone who previously worked at GT’s outside of manufacturing positions. Ramon Canek, a former vice president and COO at GT’s Living Foods (formerly Millennium Products), served as chief product officer at Health-Ade from 2014 to 2019.

“Our breweries are four miles away from each other and we both run manufacturing plants,” she said. “So it is a small community even though L.A. is huge. There will be people who come into interviews that have worked for manufacturing companies in L.A. because we are looking for people with experience. Maybe we’ll see one or two (people) from GT’s — that’s not going to be enough for me to say they can’t come in the door.”

Trout also countered Dave’s claims that Health-Ade was “killing the category” with excessive promotional pricing. He told Forbes: “Right now, you can go and buy a Health-Ade for 99 cents because they offer a coupon here and a coupon there, and you can stack the coupons.”

“Our promotions are exactly what companies are supposed to be in beverage,” Trout said in response. “There is an expectation from the store level on having promotions — you can’t even get into certain accounts without having a 16 week rotation. We do that. It would not be a sustainable business if we spent more.”

She continued: “It’s a little ironic. Everybody is doing the same thing in beverage and in kombucha — including him.”

The conversation also turned towards the topic of corporate independence. In the Forbes story, Dave — the sole stakeholder in his $900 million company — claimed to have turned down multiple investment opportunities in order to maintain control of his brand and specifically his formula. “I’m not for sale,” he said.

In the midst of LinkedIn exchanges on Trout’s post, Dave was critical of Health-Ade for an alleged lack of transparency in its affiliation with The Coca-Cola Company. In 2013, the kombucha maker received investment by First Beverage Group, which includes Coca-Cola’s Venturing and Emerging Brands (VEB) unit as a limited partner.

“The biggest misinterpretation is that somehow that investment or any of our investments by default somehow means you’ve bastardized the values or qualities that you hold,” Trout said. “I feel like doing it in glass jars, making it with cold pressed juice — these are all things that make it kind of a pain in the ass to make Health-Ade. That’s precisely the thing we haven’t caved on even four years into the relationship.”

In the story, Dave also criticized PepsiCo-owned KeVita for labeling its Master Brew line as kombucha despite the use of artificial carbonation, tea flavoring and lab-grown probiotic strains. “If you want [a drink that’s] clear and consistently sparkling with no vinegar flavor, that’s called carbonated flavored water. You can get it for 99 cents at the thrift store,” he told Forbes.

In response to a request for comment on the article, KeVita marketing VP Aidan Kingerlee told BevNET in an emailed statement that the company is “proud of our KeVita Master Brew Kombucha.” Kingerlee did not address any of the specific allegations mentioned by Dave in the article, but reiterated the company’s commitment to taste, accessibility and product safety.

For his part, GT told BevNET that his own reaction to the Forbes profile was mixed. He called the piece a “typical Forbes article” in its emphasis on financial performance and valuation and in labeling him a “billionaire,” while also noting his distaste for the headline “Tempest in a Tea Bottle.” He was more positive about the article’s accompanying video, in which he said he was “allowed to speak in complete sentences and thoughts and statements.”

“Financial journalists typically like to talk about the good — the entrepreneur, their passion, their journey, the impetus behind their creation — but at the same time, they like to throw some controversy in the mix, whether it’s in [the form of] lawsuits or category decline or competition,” he said. “So this is not the first time I’ve seen that, but you never really get used to it.”

Dave said he didn’t believe that the reporters questions were out-of-bounds or inappropriate. However, he said he was misquoted and took issue with the way in which his quotes were edited; “It’s almost like they took a portion of one statement and stitched it together with a portion of another statement to create a new statement,” he said.

With reference to the comments on Kevita and Health-Ade, Dave seemed to dispute those attributions as well. “I am so conscientious and cognizant of making sure that I never ever speak disparagingly about another brand, whether it’s kombucha or another category,” he said. However, he later added: “In the article there were inadvertent quotes that reference other brands, that was not something that was intended. If that could be done all over again, I would ask for that to have been excluded [from the story].”

He also insisted that the “three hipsters” reference was not targeted at any particular brand, and also seemed to dispute the veracity of the quote altogether.

“Those were two separate statements said in two separate conversations,” he said. “Which actually goes back to the point that I was making earlier — [Forbes] took a portion of one statement and then took a portion of another statement and stitched it together with their own words. All of a sudden it’s like words were being put in my mouth.”

The article, despite Dave’s issues with certain aspects, has still generated an overall positive response, he told BevNET. He said he has received compliments from colleagues in the industry for highlighting his “entrepreneurial, independent spirit” in a publication that primarily covers large corporations. “The majority of people who have come to me from the industry and outside of it have said they don’t think my passion was a negative thing and that it was more inspirational,” he said.

Moving forward, Dave said the experience wouldn’t dissuade him from engaging further with the public, but that he may seek other avenues outside of traditional media to do so. He said he’s learning that his personal story resonates with others, and that he will continue to take advantage of opportunities to control his narrative.

“I don’t think trolling on LinkedIn or social media is a solution,” he said. “I do think that if there’s an environment or a platform, whether it’s mine or someone else’s that I’m utilizing to share my story in an unfiltered, unedited, uncontrived fashion so you can see me for who I am — the good and the bad, the weak and the strong — then that would be an environment [in which] I feel I would really excel.”

Despite disagreeing with certain aspects of the Forbes story, Trout was adamant that the matter was closed as far as she is concerned. She also had praise for Dave and his pioneering of kombucha as a category.

“Eleven years prior to our first bottle [being sold], he had already been working on building this and had done enough work to get him national distribution, so I have a lot of respect for the guy,” she said.

As Trout sees it, the article wasn’t all bad news.

“I was somewhat happy to be called a hipster,” she said.","Forbes Fallout: Health-Ade, KeVita React to GT's Feature Story"

In April, the store made its entrance into the space with the launch of Stellar Seltzer in 12 oz. cans. The four-SKU line of naturally flavored, zero calorie sparkling waters is the next step in Boxed’s plan to feed the beverage segment of its private label business with engaging brands that can compete in high velocity foundational grocery categories such as water.

Speaking with BevNET last week, Jeff Gamsey, VP of private label at Boxed, said the company has taken brand-centric approach to developing items that can compete in crowded spaces at retail. Stellar Seltzer is the second private label beverage to be released under its own sub-brand following electrolyte infused LYT Water. The store currently sells over 100 items under the Prince & Spring mark, including coconut water.

“Despite our limited assortment strategy, we carry 31 different sparkling waters and seltzers,” he said. “It’s a big trip driver, the products are highly consumable.”

In addition to competing on price — a 24-pack of 12 oz. cans currently goes for $8.99 on the site — Gamsey said Stellar Seltzer has been formulated to be more carbonated than LaCroix. The line is available in grapefruit, lemon, tangerine and lime varieties, with further flavors set to follow later this year.

Gamsey said going forward Prince & Spring will look to introduce incremental innovations to its lines and inject a distinct personality for brands via dedicated social media accounts. He cited Fruitmojis, a fruit snack shaped like emojis, as an example of the company moving toward trends such as clean label and better-for-you; the line does not use high fructose corn syrup and is vegan friendly.

“Design and our approach to brand is cohesive (across categories),” he said. “Even though the true brand type products like Stellar and LYT Water are designed to have their own identity and personality, all of our products are infused with creativity and wit.”

So far this year, the push appears to be yielding results: the first quarter of 2019 saw Prince & Spring achieve its highest sales ever, according to the company, while Stellar Seltzer is now a Top 50 item for the store. However, the brand’s future may reside offline as well, as the company is exploring potentially stocking private label items at retail stores.",Boxed Expands Private Label Offerings With Seltzer Launch

"Even in a world increasingly dominated by cold brews, there’s room for more than one kind of cold coffee.",2019-05-22,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/21181345/Elemental_970-B1.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/coffee-giants-startups-target-growth-in-flash-brew,"Even in a world increasingly dominated by cold brews, there’s room for more than one kind of cold coffee.

Flash chilled — the general term for coffee which is brewed hot and then quickly cooled without being diluted with ice or water — is not exactly a new innovation. The method has long been prized by coffee aficionados for its ability to capture the nuanced flavor notes and complex aromatics that emerge during a hot extraction process. Popularized as the preferred style of cold coffee in Japan, flash brewed products have also helped turn that country into the world’s largest RTD coffee market, and that influence has begun to extend to the U.S. Last year, Santa Cruz, Calif.-based Verve Coffee Roasters introduced a flash chilled RTD line, part of the company’s comprehensive pivot away from cold brew.

Already a major force in the Japanese market, CPG conglomerate Suntory is aiming to leverage its experience in flash brewed RTD coffee to grow the company’s nascent U.S. presence via its flagship category brand, Boss Coffee. According to Keishi Fukata, director of marketing for Raleigh, N.C.-based Suntory Beverage & Food North America, Boss was the top-selling RTD coffee brand in Japan last year and third-highest selling beverage overall, with over 100 million cases shipped across 20 SKUs. Launched in 1992, the company has featured actor Tommy Lee Jones as its long-running spokesperson in TV ads.

The marketing and brand voice for Boss in the U.S. will hew closely to the same messages of authenticity, craft and quality that have served Suntory’s prominent spirits labels, including Jim Beam and Knob Creek.

“We think coffee is growing because of a trend towards authenticity,” Fukata told BevNET. “People are switching from indulgence coffee to authentic coffee, and you are seeing that now with cold brew.”

Boss launched in two SKUs — unsweetened black and dairy-added cafe au lait — late last year in Colorado at retailers including Safeway and Albertsons. This spring, the brand will be rolling out to independent retailers in California, Colorado and New York, where it has partnered with Gotham Brands, as well as on Amazon. The suggested retail price for both 8 oz. cans is $2.69-$2.99. Fukata said Boss, a product of Japan, will continue to be imported until the company can produce flash brewed coffee in the U.S. at scale.

That move to scale is an issue that another company is trying to solve for manufacturers interested in developing the RTD flash brew segment. Watertown, Mass.-based startup Elemental Beverage Company is aiming to disrupt the cold coffee business both on-premise and on retail shelves through its proprietary flash-chilling technology, which it has trademarked as “Snapchill.”

First showcased at the Specialty Coffee Association’s Specialty Coffee Expo in Boston in April, Elemental’s new commercial-grade Snapchiller allows cafes, restaurants and on-premise coffee accounts to quickly cool down coffee (or any other hot liquid)– without dilution or the use of any additives — by passing it through an evaporator coil. The unit can process 4-16 ounces of liquid per cycle and can chill 12 ounces of liquid per minute. The Snapchiller is expected to begin shipping to customers who have pre-ordered their units in the fourth quarter of 2019.

From an efficiency perspective, the makers say, the advantages over cold brew are obvious; rather than forcing coffee shops to brew large batches of a single coffee variety overnight, they can manage supply and minimize waste by making any kind of cold coffee on demand. Specialty coffee house George Howell currently uses the machine at its two locations in Boston.

While it seeks out partners for its on premise units, Elemental is also moving forward with its own line of “Snapchill” branded ready-to-drink coffees. Available in 12 oz. cans in three single-origin varieties, each serves as an example of how the technique can preserve the unique flavors and aromas of each type of coffee in a cold format. The product is available in 6-packs for a suggested retail price of $29.95 through the company’s website. Elemental also offers kegged coffee and a limited super premium Founder’s Selection variety in a 750 ml bottle for $235.

However, the company hopes that the largest opportunity to expand flash brew for RTD lies in Elemental’s industrial-level Snapchiller (only one is currently in operation, at the company’s headquarters). Dussault said the company had not decided whether or not it will sell that unit to individual customers or use it to form co-packing partnerships with local roasters, such as Little Wolf of Ipswich, Mass. “We want to be in control of the coffee quality and of the equipment,” he said.

As cold brew becomes more and more ubiquitous in U.S. coffee retail, the aim for flash brew producers like Boss and Elemental is to show that the evolution of the cold coffee experience is far from over.

“One of the thoughts I had in starting the company was that there is some kind of connection I have with fresh hot coffee,” he said. “There’s something special there, and that’s what I wanted to get from cold coffee.”

Correction: A previous version of this article stated the price of 6-packs of Elemental Beverage Co.’s Snapchill ready-to-drink coffee as $39.95. The article has since been updated.","Coffee Giants, Startups Target Growth in 'Flash Brew'"

"North Carolina-based kombucha maker Tribucha has closed a $1.5 million Series A funding round, the company told BevNET this week. The raise comes as the five-year-old brand, which markets its product in 12 oz cans, plans to expand distribution by more than 600 accounts this year.",2019-05-21,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/21165324/Tribucha_970.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/tribucha-closes-1-5m-series-a,"North Carolina-based kombucha maker Tribucha has closed a $1.5 million Series A funding round, the company told BevNET this week. The raise comes as the five-year-old brand, which markets its product in 12 oz cans, plans to expand distribution by more than 600 accounts this year.

Investors in the round include Kathleen and Steve Malik of Blue Ram and Mike Hockenberry of Disruptive Enterprises.

The company, founded in 2014 by Adrian Larrea and Jonathan York, raised a $375,000 seed round in 2016, which included investments from Jim Geikie, former VP and general manager of Burt’s Bees, and venture capitalist David Gardner, both of whom re-invested during the Series A.

According to CEO Paul Pritchard, who joined the company in November, the funds will go towards supporting its expansion strategy. Tribucha plans to make about 15 new hires largely in regional sales and marketing roles, including head of marketing. The company will also purchase new equipment to increase production capacity with a focus on automation technology, continuing an ongoing infrastructure expansion that began last year. Pritchard noted Tribucha is currently doubling its production output about every two months in order to meet demand.

“Two years ago, [the founders] were brewing in 55 gallon kettles,” Pritchard said. “Today we’re in 60 barrel tanks and we have multiple tanks and looking to add more. When you’re spitting out that amount of product three or four days a week and putting that into cans there’s a lot of learning. We are looking at improving the output and maximizing our resources. If you have a plant and you’re only running at 60% capacity, there’s no reason not to run that to 90% or 95% capacity because your costs don’t increase that dramatically.”

Over the past year Tribucha has grown its retail footprint from roughly 100 local accounts to more than 900 stores in 22 states on the East Coast and the Midwest. The brand is available in the Southeast region of Whole Foods and is currently stocked in 12 UNFI warehouses. The brand has also added various independent accounts and chain retailers including Stop & Shop, Lowes, Earth Fare, and Ingles. Tribucha has also signed with KeHE to begin servicing the Texas region.

“Our theory is that if a retailer has the category, [and] if kombucha is in their stores, then we’d love to talk to them,” Pritchard said.

Tribucha is also working to broaden its marketing efforts, including a recent partnership with the North Carolina Football Club, a United Soccer League team, placing banner ads in its Cary, N.C.-based stadium as well as sponsoring various running clubs.

Pritchard said Tribucha also plans to introduce one to two new flavors this year which are projected to launch at Natural Products Expo East in September.

“We’re looking to just continue to have fun, make the best product we possibly can, stay true to our ethos, and partner with anyone who’s willing to partner with us,” Pritchard said.",Tribucha Closes $1.5M Series A
"Q, the Brooklyn born-and-bred brand of spectacular carbonated mixers, has announced the addition of Elderflower Tonic to its collection of flavors.",2019-05-23,,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/q-mixers-launches-elderflower-tonic,"BROOKLYN, N.Y.— Q, the Brooklyn born-and-bred brand of spectacular carbonated mixers, has announced the addition of Elderflower Tonic to its collection of flavors.

Q Elderflower is available to on-premise accounts in 6.7 oz., 500 ml and 750 ml glass bottles and 7.5 oz. cans and will be available through Amazon.com.

Elderflowers are the blossoms of the elderberry plant and can be harvested for only a few weeks in spring, and then must be infused into syrup carefully yet extremely rapidly.

Said Q Mixers founder and CEO Jordan Silbert: “Many of our partners and fans have been asking us to develop an Elderflower Tonic. So we spent a good amount of time looking at what was already on the market, and then made something better. Like our other mixers, Q Elderflower Tonic is full of flavor with higher carbonation. But it is also less sweet, so the subtleties of great spirits are free to shine.”

Q Elderflower Tonic Water is fragrant, crisp and clean with some of the highest carbonation levels on the market. It adds an unmistakable yet subtle floral edge to your favorite cocktail. Like all Q mixers, Q Elderflower Tonic is crafted to complement great spirits rather than overpowering them. Q Elderflower Tonic is best enjoyed over ice, mixed with a good vodka, gin or liqueur.

Q makes the world’s best carbonated mixers – spectacular beverages crafted with authentic ingredients, more carbonation, and much less sugar to perfectly complement the world’s finest spirits.

"In 1985, the launch of New Coke was an unmitigated disaster for one of the world’s iconic brands, a failed experiment that inspired a customer revolt and became a punchline synonymous with bad corporate thinking.",2019-05-22,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/22165815/Coke_970-4.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/new-coke-finds-new-life-on-netflixs-stranger-things,"In 1985, the launch of New Coke was an unmitigated disaster for one of the world’s iconic brands, a failed experiment that inspired a customer revolt and became a punchline synonymous with bad corporate thinking.

In the afterglow of nostalgia, however, New Coke is an essential piece of 80s pop culture, one that The Coca-Cola Company will bring to life as part of a unique cross-promotional activation with Netflix’s hit series Stranger Things.

Starting tomorrow, May 23 at 5 p.m. EST, Coke will release a limited amount of New Coke, made using the original recipe, as part of a bundle package that also includes a Stranger Things-branded Coca-Cola and Coke Zero Sugar glass bottle. Each bundle includes two 12 oz. cans of New Coke and will be available exclusively through CokeStore.com/1985

New Coke will also be available in select cities in Stranger Things-branded vending machines inspired by the show’s “upside-down” dimension, which will dispense product for free. The first machine will launch tomorrow in New York. Visitors to World of Coca-Cola in Atlanta will also have a chance to receive New Coke cans as a gift, as will customers who make a purchase of $19.85 or more at the Coca-Cola Store in Las Vegas.

The tie-in will also be promoted via a video ad that will run online and in select cinemas starting this Friday. The clip, directed by Stranger Things creators the Duffer Brothers, will feature characters from the show drinking New Coke at a move theatre.

The collaboration with Coke hinges on the Netflix show’s setting and themes; set in the mid-1980s, Stranger Things follows the adventures of a group of young friends caught up in a supernatural conspiracy in their small Indiana town. The show, which will release its third season in July, features large and small nods to 80s pop culture throughout, and has generated a large fan base that has helped the franchise expand to licensed comics, books, video games and even its own Lego set.

According to Coca-Cola, Netflix contacted the soda giant to discuss how it could “authentically integrate” New Coke into the third season of the show, which takes place during summer 1985. Following a visit by Netflix to Coke’s archives in Atlanta to “study New Coke packaging, memorabilia, [and] advertising,” the soda company decided to go further by resurrecting the ill-fated brand. That process involved everything from replicating the exact shade of “Coke Red” on the can label to sourcing ingredients and getting approval to produce concentrate.

“Ultimately, we looked around the room and said, ‘Why wouldn’t we do this?’” said Oana Vlad, director of Coca-Cola Trademark for Coca-Cola North America, according to the company. “No one would have ever thought we’d produce New Coke again after what happened in 1985, but we all agreed that if we wanted to partner with Netflix and Stranger Things in a truly culturally relevant way that would resonate with our fans – and theirs – then we had to make the New Coke story come to life.”

For the last 34 years, New Coke was a chapter of company’s history that it would just as soon rather forget. Introduced by CEO Roberto Goizueta during a press conference in April 1985 as “the most significant soft-drink marketing development in the company’s nearly 100-year history,” New Coke was backed by a marketing blitz and by taste test data that showed consumers preferred it over the old recipe. Yet despite Goizueta’s claim that it was the “surest move ever made,” the product suffered an intense backlash; according to Mark Pendergrast’s definitive history of The Coca-Cola Company, For God, Country and Coca-Cola, by the beginning of June 1985, the company was receiving 8,000 calls per day complaining about the new line. In response, Coke reintroduced the soda’s original formula as Coca-Cola Classic just 79 days after the launch of New Coke.

The collaboration with Stranger Things gives Coke a high profile stage on which to spin one of its biggest ever corporate blunders into a meta pop culture moment that shows consumers a more playful side.

Michael Burdett, Coke’s principal scientists for global category development, said reviving New Coke via Stranger Things was a way to show “we don’t take ourselves too seriously.”

“One of our growth behaviors is celebrating and learning from failure, and New Coke – for better or worse – is known as a failure,” he said.

At the very least, according to Vlad, the brand knows its consumers still have strong feelings about its “classic” formula.

“New Coke taught us that our fans are extremely passionate about our brand and great taste,” Vlad said. “That passion has helped propel Coke to the iconic brand it is today and encourages us to continue to do big things to connect with our fans. It’s not about a ‘mistake’… it’s what we learned and the incredible cultural resonance of Coca-Cola.”",New Coke Finds New Life on Netflix's Stranger Things
"Last Wednesday, Vita Coco maker All Market Inc. began the day by launching its new Impossible to Hate campaign — a summer marketing drive to promote its pressed coconut water line.",2019-05-23,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/23143443/VitaCoco_970.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/inside-vita-cocos-bathroom-breakout,"Last Wednesday, Vita Coco maker All Market Inc. began the day by launching its new Impossible to Hate campaign — a summer marketing drive to promote its pressed coconut water line.

By 3 p.m. their social media coordinator was standing in the bathroom holding a jug of urine and asking for an address where she could mail it.

While associating its products with pee is something most beverage brands tend to avoid, Vita Coco’s risky tweet has been a major success, the company said — one that it’s proud to stand behind. A week later, the viral moment has received more than 4,500 retweets, 32,000 likes, and free media exposure with write-ups in Vox, New York Magazine, Fox News, and Business Insider.

So, as Mashable’s Morgan Sung asked, “How the hell did we get here?”

Speaking with BevNET this week, Vita Coco brand director Allison Finazzo and community coordinator Lane Rawlings (the woman in the photo) said the moment was improvised and authentic, but also tied to the company’s broader Impossible to Hate campaign.

Conceived in coordination with creative partner Interesting Development, Impossible to Hate is focused on promoting the company’s Coconut Water with Pressed Coconut SKU by reaching out to “haters” online and urging them to try the product in order to prove that the drink can win over even the most hardened skeptics. The company used an algorithm to scrape user reviews from Amazon, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and other websites to find users with the highest amount of negative reviews — identifying nearly one million people with more than 40 million combined posts — whom they could try and convert to fans of the pressed line.

“We felt that if we could get a mediocre review from people who are giving one star to the Grand Canyon or a teddy bear, or writing that Chicago ‘is not worth it’, then it would show pressed is truly impossible to hate,” Finazzo said.

On Wednesday, Rawlings was tasked with using the official Vita Coco Twitter account to reach out to users who had in the past tweeted about hating coconut water and engage them directly about the pressed line. That’s when she encountered amateur mixed martial arts fighter Tony Posnanski.

On March 8, Posnanski had tweeted a list of “unpopular opinions,” including that “Candy Corn is absolute trash,” “The Beatles are very overrated,” and that “Coconut water is disgusting.” Rawlings responded to the tweet, telling the fighter there was “such a thing as too many eggs.” After a brief exchange, Posnanski — who had coincidentally written about his hatred of coconut water in The Huffington Post in 2013 (something Finazzo and Rawlings said they were unaware of at the time) — ultimately said the magic words.

The idea came from Rawlings, a recent college graduate who joined the company as an intern in September before starting full time in January. She and Finazzo then took the idea to All Market Inc. co-founder and CEO Mike Kirban, who gave it the green light. Within two hours of Posnanski’s response, Rawlings’ tweet went out and almost immediately took off as Twitter users reacted to the brand’s decision to put a picture of a jar of urine with its logo on it online.

The company even used an alternate photo of Rawlings with the jar as its Twitter profile image for several days.

“We’re not owned by Coke or Pepsi, we weren’t sitting in a boardroom debating and calling legal counsel,” Finazzo said, “It’s just what we do. We try to sell coconut water and have fun doing it.”

Over the past few years brands have taken an increasingly cavalier approach to marketing on Twitter. Unlike the glamour shots and lifestyle ideations that thrive on Instagram, Twitter’s conversational setup favors snarky comedy, irony, and a sense of authenticity — and its skeptical user base can often spot “brand speak” from a mile away. This has led to numerous companies allowing their social media accounts to take a freer tone of voice in communicating with consumers and competitors — whether its Wendy’s suggesting McDonald’s be thrown in the trash, or SunnyD tweeting cryptic, worrying thoughts.

For many online users, Vita Coco seemed to take this marketing style to the next level. The daring nature of the photo — combined with the visceral satisfaction of a brand “clapping back” at a “hater” in real time — appeared to connect with consumers who may have rolled their eyes at less clever social media marketing. Even Posnanski tweeted that he was impressed, although according to Finazzo he has yet to try the product.

According to Rawlings, she had little hesitation about being the face of the moment.

“There was a slight moment where it was like ‘oh my god, what is my dad going to say?’” she said. “But moving forward I’ve gotten so many really wonderful reactions and people praising me, which feels kind of bizarre.”

Finazzo said in many ways the stunt fits Vita Coco’s brand identity and demonstrates how the brand is able “to move quickly, be agile, and take risks at the highest level of the organization.” She said the tweet was meant — and received — in good humor, and not intended to be combative or snarky. Instead, the tweet showed “that the brand has a human element to it.”

As for the Impossible to Hate campaign, the company plans to continue rolling out promotions throughout the summer. In addition to video content, Vita Coco will be announcing a money back guarantee within the next week where consumers who try the pressed flavor can receive a coupon refund if they dislike it. The company’s field marketing team will also run sampling demos nationwide. Finazzo added that Twitter will continue to play a role in the company’s marketing.

“I think it’s been an amazing way for us to truly have people appraise and reappraise the brand who weren’t really thinking about Vita Coco before,” Finazzo said. “The tone and how we handled this interaction speaks a lot about our brand, our values, our culture, and our personality. The fact that people are seeing that on such a grand scale is really exciting to us because it gives us a platform to continue to communicate in this way.”

As part of the partnership, Puget Sound Honor Flight and Sparkling Ice transport heroes from their hometown of Seattle, Washington to Washington, D.C. to visit and reflect at the memorials dedicated to honor their service and sacrifices.

In support of this year’s Honor Flight, Sparkling Ice will be releasing new limited-edition case wraps specially designed to promote Honor Flight which are now available in stores nationwide and will be incorporated into in-store displays over Memorial Day and Fourth of July. The wraps will be red, white and blue and feature illustrations of the American flag, military camouflage and silhouettes of soldiers saluting. This marks Sparkling Ice’s first year debuting the new wraps in support for Honor Flight.

“Our support for The Honor Flight Network began several years ago when I came across an Honor Flight departure at the airport,” said Talking Rain’s CEO and U.S. Navy Veteran, Chris Hall. “Puget Sound Honor Flight is committed to giving these heroes their ‘One Last Mission’ and as such, this year marks the first year that I will be taking part in the flight from Seattle to Washington D.C. along with our American veterans. Through our continued support and launch of the new wraps, we hope to continue raising awareness for both the organization and all veterans who have served across the country.”

Beyond the new case wraps, Sparkling Ice supports The Honor Flight Network through a patriotic in-store retail program and a series of fundraising efforts. Over the course of their partnership, the brand has raised more than $216,000 for the Honor Flight Network since 2016 and is looking to raise an additional $130,000 through its ongoing initiatives and donations from vendors, partners and individuals.

“As a third-generation U.S military veteran, this partnership is close to my heart. It’s an honor to stand side-by-side with these personal heroes of mine while we visit the memorials,” said Hall. “I only hope I can keep up with them.”

An iconic brand in the Seattle-area for more than 30 years, Talking Rain is a Washington-based beverage company situated in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. This innovative company is outselling global brands in flavor-categories across the U.S., while beginning to find success internationally with the brand’s bold-flavored, lightly carbonated sparkling water.

A part of the Talking Rain product portfolio for over 25 years, Sparkling Ice beverages were often overlooked, until a major organizational shift in 2010 where the new leadership team refocused the company’s efforts on this diamond in the rough. At that time, Talking Rain started to build a strong marketing, sales and manufacturing team to focus efforts on this flavored, zero-calorie carbonated beverage, which was quietly building a strong following in the Northwest since entering the marketplace.

"— BKON, leading beverage technology innovator and the inventor of the RAIN (Reverse Atmospheric Infusion) brewing process, today announced a partnership with specialty coffee roaster One Village Coffee to launch the company’s first line of canned cold brew products.",2019-05-23,,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/one-village-coffee-partners-with-bkon-to-launch-canned-cold-brew,"MOORESTOWN, N.J.— BKON, leading beverage technology innovator and the inventor of the RAIN (Reverse Atmospheric Infusion) brewing process, today announced a partnership with specialty coffee roaster One Village Coffee to launch the company’s first line of canned cold brew products.

Working with BKON, One Village Coffee will soon deliver 6-packs of 12 fl. oz. cans to select Wegmans stores in the Philadelphia, New Jersey and Maryland markets. Single cans will be available at several regional independent markets and grocers. Both products will also be available for pick up at One Village Coffee’s roastery in Souderton, Pennsylvania.

According to One Village Coffee President Andrea Hackman, BKON’s RAIN technology is single handedly helping them develop fresh, long-lasting packaged cold brew that meets the growing demands of both consumers and grocers alike.

“Our customers started asking for cold brew about a year ago,” Hackman said. “But, we didn’t feel confident launching a product, as existing brewing methods resulted in a flavor profile that was short-lived and flat.”

After developing a recipe with BKON, One Village Coffee’s calculus changed.

“Once we tested the RAIN brewing process, we immediately realized it was our solution,” Hackman added. “They were able to execute on our vision for excellent flavor and shelf life that we couldn’t accomplish on our own. Now, we can focus on what we do best – roasting – while BKON handles the grinding and brewing.”

One Village Coffee is now delivering canned cold brew coffee to their retail partners with greater speed and volume, backed by the assurance that consumers can finally experience a fresh taste months after production.

According to BKON, this growth and product expansion is precisely what RAIN was intended to offer beverage producers. “RAIN is helping beverage makers enter new markets, grow their businesses, and redefine what high-quality really means,” said Dean Vastardis, co-founder at BKON. “One Village Coffee has been an excellent partner, and we’re excited for retailers and consumers to have access to cafe-quality cold brew any time and in larger quantities.”

One Village Coffee has always done things a little differently, such as their partnership with Shared-X. The coffee used to create the cold brew is from Finca Matapalo, an Impact Farming coffee produced by Shared-X. Impact Farming empowers farmers to take pride in who they are and what they do by creating a value chain of transparency, access to markets, deep care for people and the environment, and dedication to innovation.

“Our goal is to sell as much coffee as possible from Finca Matapalo, and this new BKON-brewed product line enables us to do that,” Hackman said.

While other cold brew methods rely on suspending coffee particles in water, BKON’s RAIN technology uses a much more advanced process to extract every succulent note from any ingredient a beverage producer wants to extract into liquid. First, a vacuum removes the gases from the ingredient’s structure. Water is then infused into the empty spaces, where it absorbs the flavors and aromas contained in the ingredients. By controlling the strength, duration and frequency of vacuum cycles, RAIN extracts far more flavor than traditional brewing methods.

“BKON has been an amazing team to work with – the value they deliver through their technology and beverage crafting experience has helped us determine the best path forward,” Hackman concluded. “Having a responsive, knowledgeable partner makes all the difference when launching a new product.”

BKON is dedicated to enabling beverage brands with technology platforms and know-how, to produce precise and scalable natural beverage outcomes of the highest quality. We are relentlessly focused on innovating systems for the world of craft refreshment with our RAIN (Reverse Atmospheric Infusion) technology.

Don Ciccio & Figli,2019-05-14,,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/don-ciccio-figli-launches-ambrosia-aperitivo,"WASHINGTON, D.C.— Don Ciccio & Figli, a fourth-generation Italian herbal liqueur producer, has announced the launch of Ambrosia, an aperitivo distilled using a centuries-old family recipe. Ambrosia, which translates to mean “the nectar of the Gods,” is a bittersweet aperitivo handcrafted in small batches using all-natural ingredients. Ambrosia is now available nationwide in 750ML (SRP $30.99).

The liqueur will launch with a campaign entitled, “Old World, New Charm” which is a nod to its legacy as an old family recipe and its rebirth on the other side of the Atlantic. With over 135 years of family history, the Don Ciccio & Figli product range spans from the beautifully bitter to the seductively sweet with hundreds of taste notes to explore.

Ambrosia opens with flavors of cantaloupe and turmeric and is complimented by notes of blood orange, carrots and nine botanicals. Ambrosia is low in alcohol content and is favorably mixed as a spritzer. While the botanicals are sourced from Italy, many of the ingredients are sourced from directly within the United States, including the blood oranges from Florida and the cantaloupes from Virginia.

“The launch of Ambrosia is truly a celebration of rebirth and of the intersection of Old World and New,” said Francesco Amodeo, president and master distiller. “Ambrosia, like our other products, is a classic family recipe brought back to life for drinkers to enjoy in today’s modern world. Its launch is perfect timing for a fresh spring cocktail mixed with Ambrosia.”

Coinciding with the product launch is the opening of the new Don Ciccio & Figli distillery which includes a tasting room and Bar Sirenis, named after the mythical Sirens heard on the Amalfi Coast. Guests can enjoy specialty cocktails, including the notable Ambrosia Spritz, all made with the Don Ciccio & Figli product range. Don Ciccio & Figli is located on Washington D.C.’s prominent‘Distillery Row’ in Ivy City at 1907 Fairview Avenue NE, Washington, DC 20002.

Don Ciccio & Figli represents the rebirth of the Amodeo family, just as it was in 1883 when great grandfather Vincenzo Amodeo perfected the Italian recipes which became the finest liqueurs on the Amalfi Coast. In 2012, Francesco Amodeo, a fourth-generation Amodeo, brought the signature flavors of his hometown back to life asDon Ciccio & Figli. Based in its new home of Washington D.C., Don Ciccio & Figli was born in the Amalfi Coast and reborn in the United States.

"– Newly created company Kinderfarms is on a mission to make natural children’s wellness products accessible to every family. In a world that is increasingly focused on real, healthy ingredients, there are still many categories on shelf where outdated artificial products are the only option.",2019-05-24,,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/kinderfarms-announces-first-product-kinderlyte,"LOS ANGELES– Newly created company Kinderfarms is on a mission to make natural children’s wellness products accessible to every family. In a world that is increasingly focused on real, healthy ingredients, there are still many categories on shelf where outdated artificial products are the only option.

Kinderfarms’ first product launch is Kinderlyte, a line of Oral Electrolyte Solutions (OES) that contain no artificial sweeteners, flavors, or colors and are Non-GMO Project Verified. They will be sold in 1 liter (33.8 fl oz) BPA-free resealable bottles in the children’s wellness and baby food sections of various drug, grocery and natural food stores nationwide, as well as online. Available in three kid-friendly flavors – fruit punch, orange and grape – Kinderlyte is vegan, gluten free and contains no fructose or artificial ingredients of any kind.

“In 2016, I made a 2 a.m. trip to the store for my daughter who was sick with the flu, only to find that the oral electrolyte solution I had purchased was full of artificial sweeteners, flavors and colors – ingredients like Sucralose, Acesulfame Potassium, Yellow #6, Blue #1, Red #40 – that I wouldn’t drink myself, much less give to her,” said Jeremy Adams, CEO, founder, Kinderfarms.

This late-night trip inspired him to seek out effective natural options, and when he wasn’t able to find any, he decided to create his own. With an MBA from Harvard Business School and a history of almost 20 years in the consumer goods space, Adams was well-prepared to begin this new adventure. Adams has built a career on delivering better-for-you solutions to consumers, including previous executive roles at various CPG brands, including VP of marketing at GT’s Kombucha and head of marketing at POM Wonderful. He is also committed to service, so Kinderfarms has committed 1% of sales (not profits) to provide life-saving access to clean water for families in need.

Kinderfarms has partnered with Venice Brands for its initial launch, which incubates and invests in consumer brands with a focus on health and wellness.

“I have known Jeremy since our days at business school, and we worked closely at POM Wonderful where we launched several new product lines together. I am incredibly excited to partner with him. Kinderlyte is truly a better product than what is out there in terms of both taste and ingredients, and we are excited to make it available to families in the months ahead. We have other ideas to extend the platform and to provide families with products that they feel comfortable actually giving their children,” noted Greg Willsey, founder and owner of Venice Brands.

They have started building out a world class team in recent months as Kinderlyte prepares for launch in early June. The team’s first hire was Sean McLean, who was the VP of sales at Zarbees and led the company’s tremendous growth over the past five years through an exit to Johnson & Johnson. They have since added Melanie Juracek as director of operations and Izzy Chafkin (a shared Venice Brands resource) as director of finance. They plan to expand the marketing team to support this new distribution and focus on new product development.

With confirmed upcoming distribution at major retailers, Kinderlyte will be on shelf in the very near future. The product will be available nationally at Kinderlyte.com and Amazon.com so families will finally have a choice when it comes to family hydration.

– Florida Food Products will officially unveil its new line of fermented vegetable juices at the 2019 IFT trade show June 2-5 in New Orleans.,2019-05-24,,https://www.bevnet.com/news/supplier-news/2019/florida-food-products-launches-line-of-fermented-juices/,"EUSTIS, Fla.– Florida Food Products will officially unveil its new line of fermented vegetable juices at the 2019 IFT trade show June 2-5 in New Orleans.

Florida Food Products’ new line of liquid and powdered lactic acid fermented vegetable products currently includes beet, carrot, onion and mushroom. These ingredients are excellent options to create great-tasting and on-trend flavors for a variety of functional food and beverage applications.

“Fermented ingredients offer brand owners an opportunity to create or reimagine their products to align with their customers’ desire for clean label, authentic products. We’ve been a leading supplier of fruit- and vegetable-based ingredients for over six decades, and the entrance into the fermented ingredient market was a natural step for us,” said Christopher Naese, Florida Food Products’ VP of business development.

The centerpiece of Florida Food Products’ fermented ingredient line is its beet juice, which possesses a pleasing fruitiness and deep color with a reduced earthiness associated with beetroots.

It is an ideal solution for food and beverage brands looking to add an attractive and memorable color and dynamic flavor to their formulation while keeping sugars low and labels clean. Florida Food Products recently published a white paper on the health benefits of fermented beet juice.

Fermented foods are part of a larger movement in the food and beverage industry toward authentic natural ingredients that provide colors and flavors from foodstuffs.

MidOcean Partners acquired Florida Food Products in September 2018 and is investing in the company’s continued growth and expansion to better serve its customers worldwide.

Oatly, a Swedish-based brand of oat milk and oat milk-based products, has been available in Europe for over 25 years and entered the American market in 2016. The U.S. launch was timed to meet surging interest in plant-based dairy alternatives, but while Oatly anticipated a strong start, the overwhelming demand for product was more than the company could handle. Just months after its debut, Oatly was faced with severe out-of-stock issues and enraged customers as it sought short and long-term solutions to its supply chain challenges.

Although Oatly has gotten back on track and is the leading brand in a thriving oat milk category, Mike Messersmith, the general manager of Oatly’s U.S. operations, was candid about the company’s early mistakes — and the likelihood that more will follow.

“We’ve already failed in the biggest ways possible; we’ll do it again,” he said in an interview included in this episode. “It’s all about progress,” Messersmith said. “Next week will be better than this week, a month from now will be better than that week. It will be messy. It’s always been messy. The thing I have to do more than correcting failure is reminding people — and remind myself — that it’s going to get better. And it still won’t be perfect, but the only way is forward.”

As part of our interview, Messersmith explained how Oatly leans on its origin story to differentiate itself from the growing number of oat milk brands coming to market and why focusing on the unnecessary has been a valuable part of its business strategy. Messersmith, a former Navy officer and longtime food and beverage executive, also discussed his approach to leadership and how he defines success.

Natalie’s Lemon and Natalie’s Lime juices will remain in the HDPE packaging (as these are food service times that do not appear at retail for the consumer to see) with Natalie’s juice offerings in the 64 oz. bottle being transitioned to PET containers in late August.

PET allows for more product transparency, letting customers see the rich color of the fresh juice. It is a highly-valued packaging material, is strong yet lightweight, non-reactive and shatterproof. It is recyclable. Best of all, it’s certified BPA free and classified as recycle 1. PET’s safety when it comes to storing beverages is recognized by health authorities around the world.

According to a recent survey from L.E.K. consulting, consumer demand for healthier and environmentally friendly packaging has driven 85% of Consumer Product Good companies to change their brand packaging.

The PET transition comes at the perfect time, allowing Natalie’s to elevate the quality of their products concurrent with the company’s expanding geographic reach and exponential sales growth.

“At Natalie’s, we continually seek innovative and sustainable ways to produce and package our clean, authentic juices,” said Marygrace Sexton, the founder and CEO of Natalie’s Orchid Island Juice Company. “This is our first bottle manufacturing change in over thirty years, and we’re happy we can maintain Natalie’s distinct bottle shape, while at the same time having our updated packaging reflect our core value of producing high quality juices.”

While the new bottles will be distinguished by their magenta cap color, across all juices, other packaging elements like UPC code, GTIN number, pack/sizes and TI/HI will remain the same.

“At Natalie’s, we only implement changes that benefit our customers,” said Natalie Sexton, VP of marketing. “Our switch to PET bottles continues our tradition of bringing excellence to our customers, be that in the form of fresh ingredients, great taste or versatile packaging.”

This is the company’s largest financing to-date.This financing has enabled the development and launch of Spärkel, the innovative sparkling beverage system that infuses real ingredients and bubbles into drinks at the touch-of-a-button without a CO2 tank.

Making infused sparkling beverages at home has just become easier, healthier and more flavorful, with the unveiling of Spärkel. It is a sophisticated alternative to traditional CO2 tank systems, allowing people to put the fizz into any drink in as little as 90 seconds. Spärkel is available for presale now on Indiegogo with early bird discounts of up to 50%.

“People everywhere are seeking healthier hydration without giving up taste. The challenge is that flavored carbonated water uses synthesized chemicals to flavor the drink. People that are looking for healthier alternatives are the same people that value natural, real ingredients,” said Mark Lerohl, president of Radar Capital. “Spärkel is a perfect fit for consumers that are seeking healthier hydration because it brings real ingredients to beverages. You can sparkle everything from pure water, to sparkling fruit infusions to mimosas and bubbly cocktails. Plus you don’t need to carry heavy cans and bottles home anymore–or return old, clunky CO2 tanks to the store.

Spärkel has just been released for pre-purchase to early adopters on the Indiegogo platform. Heavy interest has resulted in Spärkel surpassing its funding objective on Indiegogo within 48 hours of launch.The company will use a portion of the Series B funding to accelerate its marketing efforts with full launch later this summer and for growth by continuing to expand the distribution of Spärkel.

The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo and Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) all saw declines in beverage dollar sales during the four week period. Total beverage sales for Coke were down 1.5%, though the soda giant did record a slight 0.1% uptick in carbonated soft drinks (CSDs). PepsiCo reported a 1.4% decline in total beverage and snack sales, with a 3.4% drop in CSDs weighing down its results. Meanwhile, KDP outperformed its two rivals in terms of CSD dollar sales, which were up 2.4% over the four weeks, though total beverage sales were down 0.3%.

Total category growth in CSDs was a muted 0.1% during the period, with average price up 2.6% and volume down 3.6%.

In energy, overall dollar sales continued to be strong, although not as high as in the same period last year; The category rose 8.9% during the four-week period, and is up 10.7% for the 12-week period. Sales and volumes of Red Bull were up 2.6% and 2.4% respectively, though both have decelerated over the 12 weeks.

Boosted by robust sales numbers from Java Monster (up 9.2%), Monster’s core energy lineup (excluding Mutant) grew 2.2%. However, volume fell 3.6% while average price increased 6% during the four weeks. With Reign, Monster’s new ‘performance energy’ subline, the company is in the midst of enjoying one of its strongest new product debuts; according to an analysis by Wells Fargo Securities, Reign’s weekly sales are now over $7 million at retail, more than triple that of Ultra, Mutant and Hydro at the same point after their respective introductions. Analyst Bonnie Herzog pointed to the combination of Coke’s strong distribution system and improved execution in launching new products by Monster as key attributes in Reign’s success thus far. She also noted that the line’s 35% all-channel ACV suggests it has plenty of room for further growth.

Dollar sales in the still flavored water category fell 1.7% overall, with both Coke and Pepsi contributing to the drag. The former saw dollar sales continue to fall, down 5.1% over the four-week period after posting 1.6 percent growth over the 12-week period. Meanwhile, Pepsi also saw sales decelerating, growing just 4.3% over the four weeks, compared to 14% growth over the 12 weeks. Private label has been the main beneficiary of those declines; dollar sales (15.8%) and volumes (5.2%) were both up during the four-week period.

In the sparkling flavored water segment, Nestlé Holdings and Polar Corp. appear to gaining ground left behind by National Beverage Corp. (NBC). The Florida-based company, makers of LaCroix, saw dollar sales decline 16.1% and volumes fall 17.5% during the four week period, while Nestlé (6.1% sales growth) and Polar (9.8%) continued to rise, though at a slower pace than over the last eight and 12 weeks. Meanwhile, Talking Rain posted 18.2% dollar sales growth, along with a 21.8% increase in volumes.

Bottled water saw a 1.3% decline in dollar sales, according to Nielsen. Nestlé Holdings, the category’s biggest shareholder, saw sales decline accelerate during the four week period, down 8.7% compared to down 4.3% in the eight weeks.

Private label water sales increased 6.6%, with volume up 8% and average price down 1.2%.

Ready-to-drink coffee sales increased 5.3% during the four week period, thanks mainly to growth from PepsiCo and Starbucks’ North American Coffee Partnership (up 4.1%) and from brands categorized by Nielsen as “all others” (46.8%). Coke saw the steepest decline in sales, falling 21.9% over the four weeks, with volume also dropping 23.7%.

"JBT Corporation has announced the launch of a new solution for filling flexible pouches commonly used in the infant nutrition and sports drinks categories, which could spark further market growth for the sector. The JBT AsepFlex Linear Pouch Filler has been developed to overcome problems associated with current pouch packaging, including a high rejection rate and low capacity.",2019-05-28,,https://www.bevnet.com/news/supplier-news/2019/jbt-launches-new-solution-for-pouch-packaging/,"LAKELAND, Fla.— JBT Corporation has announced the launch of a new solution for filling flexible pouches commonly used in the infant nutrition and sports drinks categories, which could spark further market growth for the sector. The JBT AsepFlex Linear Pouch Filler has been developed to overcome problems associated with current pouch packaging, including a high rejection rate and low capacity.

The market of flexible packaging is growing, with pouches becoming the preferred option for processors and consumers thanks to their non-breakable, lightweight, easy to open, and easy to empty (squeezable) characteristics. In the infant nutrition category flexible pouches are expected to grow their market share by 10% each year.

However, growth in the category has been restricted by limits to current pouch filling technology. The two existing shelf stable pouch solutions both suffer from significant drawbacks. Solutions using an aseptic form fill seal typically have a low capacity and a high Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) due to a high rejection rate. Hot fill with retort sterilization solutions, meanwhile, often have low (120 ppm) capacity and low product quality.

The JBT AsepFlex Linear Pouch Filler has been developed to solve the problems with these existing solutions by substantially improving capacity and operational performance. With a capacity as high as 500 ppm – or 30,000 pouches per hour – the fully aseptic solution is designed in accordance with the FDA guidelines for low acid aseptically filled food products and can achieve an impressive operational performance, with a 95% efficiency rate and a typical reject rate of only 0.5%.

JBT product manager Bert Krakers, said: “Apart from capacity and aseptic integrity, the AsepFlex Filler offers flexibility. Pouch formats and sizes can be changed on the fly without the necessity to change parts.”

The filling system, he explained, can fill a wide range of products from water-like liquids through to high viscous products, such as smoothies with particulates. It can also be equipped with a nitrogen dosing system to reduce the oxygen in the headspace of the pouch, which limits the chemical deterioration (oxidation) of the product, helping maximize product shelf life in the process.

The JBT AsepFlex Filler has been designed for use with infant nutrition products, such as fruit and vegetable purees, and ready-to-drink baby food, as well as sports and breakfast drinks ‘on-the-go’, and nutraceutical products. A first AsepFlex filling unit in Europe has recently been supplied to a leading specialist in infant nutrition.

“BOS Brands is committed to bringing health, joy and great taste to thirsty people everywhere,” said Montse De Rojas, global marketing director for BOS Brands. “Our marketing activities have always been inspired by the South African expression ‘Go BOS,’ which means to go crazy in a good way, seeking health and fun. Building a campaign around a weekly digital cleanse seemed a natural next step.”

Enjoying the magic of life is in the nature of BOS. Born in Cape Town in 2010, BOS Brands harnesses the superfood power of rooibos – or “red bush” to offer two lines of premium organic iced teas in the U.S. Each can of BOS Iced Tea contains the equivalent of at least four cups of brewed rooibos, making it the ultimate health conscious elixir to reward the body, mind and spirit.

All the rooibos used in BOS beverages is hand-harvested in the magical Cederberg Mountains of South Africa, a unique 60-mile radius of pristine wilderness, just outside Cape Town, and the only place on the planet where rooibos grows.

BOS Iced Teas are available at Whole Foods, Erewon and other retailers on the West Coast, as well as on the company’s website and Amazon. For more information on BOS Iced Tea and the BOS Brands GO FOR FUN campaign, please visit bosbrands.com/en.

The BOS philosophy is simple – being healthy should be fun. Our mission? To bring health, joy and great taste to thirsty people everywhere. Founded in 2009 in Cape Town, BOS harnesses the benefits of rooibos – a unique South African superfood – to create a delicious ready-to-drink range of organic iced teas. Blended with all-natural fruit flavors and delivered in bright, bold colorful packaging, BOS Iced Teas give fun a new flavor. The brand’s marketing activities are inspired by the South African expression “Go BOS,” which means to go crazy in a fun way; and this approach is at the heart of the BOS experience. BOS’ rooibos tea is farmed ethically on Klipopmekaar – a private nature reserve high up in the Cederberg Mountains in South Africa – a pristine wilderness and the only place on the planet where rooibos grows. Giving back to its roots, BOS plants and maintains one tree for every 2,000 cans sold. To date it’s planted over 20,000 trees in underprivileged areas of South Africa and is well on the way to achieving the brand’s goal of planting 50,000 trees by 2020.

The two new products are based on FITAID & FITAID RX, the LIFEAID brand’s signature recovery blends, longtime staples of passionate amateurs and professional athletes nationwide.

FITAID ZERO and FITAID RX ZERO offer the nutrients and recovery function of FITAID, with zero sugar and no artificial sweeteners

Both ‘ZERO SUGAR’ products are available for sale online starting today, May 14, at LIFEAIDBevCo.com. The brand’s loyal following is clearly eager for the release, with over $100,000 in confirmed pre-orders. Online, the new sugar-free recovery blends will sell for $59.76 for a 24-can case and at select retailers and gyms for $2.99 per 12 oz. can.

The original popularity of FITAID is due to its great taste and proprietary formula of Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs), Turmeric to help decrease post-workout inflammation, 45mg of natural caffeine from green tea, and ingredients like Glucosamine, Glutamine, Arginine, B-complex, Vitamins C & D, Omega-3s & CoQ10 – all expertly formulated to support recovery from physical activity or exercise. With the addition of FITAID ZERO and FITAID RX ZERO, the FITAID lineup still contains the same recovery ingredients, now with zero sugar. Both ZERO products are sweetened with Monk Fruit and Stevia, and like all LIFEAID products, contain no sodium and no artificial flavors or sweeteners. And for anyone who wants additional recovery for their muscles, FITAID RX ZERO contains 1,000 mg of creatine to help build strength.

“There’s a lot of attention being placed on not-so-good-for-you workout drinks that are chock full of junk and unhealthy amounts of caffeine, taurine, sodium and sugar,” said LIFEAID co-founder and president Aaron Hinde. “That’s why we’re proud to offer the fitness community clean, sugar-free, post-workout recovery options with FITAID ZERO and RX ZERO. “Crafting better-for-you recovery options without the use of artificial sweeteners, sucralose or aspartame — while being sugar-free and still offering great taste — is something our team is very proud of accomplishing.”

The introduction of FITAID ZERO and FITAID RX ZERO brings the total number of LIFEAID products to nine. Since selling their first beverage back in 2011, LIFEAID still continues to proudly creates “vitamins you’ll enjoy drinking,” with proprietary blends that emphasize a sophisticated combination of ingredients to meet the physical and mental demands of healthy, active, competitive men and women throughout their daily lives.

Expect FITAID ZERO and FITAID RX ZERO to find a loyal following, quickly. The LIFEAID brand boasts over 500k followers on social media, with FITAID already being sold at over 30,000 retailers across the country including new LIFEAID retailer partners Walmart, Kroger and CVS.

LIFEAID offers a range of “vitamins you’ll actually enjoy drinking” including: LIFEAID, FITAID, FOCUSAID, IMMUNITIYAID PARTYAID, GOLFERAID and the newly launched FITAID ZERO and FITAID RX ZERO.

"Happy Moose Juice (HMJ), a San Francisco based cold-pressed fruit and vegetable juice company, launches their first Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program geared towards teaching local youth entrepreneurial skills, product development, marketing and sales know-how and business management.",2019-05-15,,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/happy-moose-juice-partners-with-boys-girls-clubs-of-san-francisco-to-launch-new-bottled-smoothie,"SAN FRANCISCO— Happy Moose Juice (HMJ), a San Francisco based cold-pressed fruit and vegetable juice company, launches their first Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program geared towards teaching local youth entrepreneurial skills, product development, marketing and sales know-how and business management.

Together, the group of youth and Happy Moose Juice team members have developed a new smoothie targeting consumers looking for a healthy and delicious beverage that is more fibrous and substantial than the traditional cold-pressed juices the company offers. The new recipe “Hella Berry” consists of strawberries, blueberries, pineapple, apple, banana, beets, lemon, coconut milk and water and will be launched as a co-branded effort by Happy Moose Juice and Boys & Girls Clubs of San Francisco (BGCSF). The “Hella Berry” smoothie will be available for purchase at local retailers including Bi-Rite Market, Boudin Bakery Cafes, Rainbow Grocery, The Mill and select La Boulangerie de San Francisco locations, with 20% of all profits returning directly to the Club and the youth participating on the project.

Founded in 2013 out of a single location pop-up on Valencia St. in the Mission, Happy Moose Juice’s CSR program focuses on teaching entrepreneurship, community building, and healthy living to local youth. This program marks another new development for the young business which supplies signature recipe, cold-pressed juices via wholesale to natural grocers, as well as various food service retail businesses throughout California, and directly to Bay Area corporate offices. The company also offers fresh juices direct to consumers and large scale caterer partners.

Happy Moose Juice is led by 33-year-old founder and CEO Ryan Armistead whose company is comprised of a 10-person team of talented go-getters. He and his team are thrilled to have the opportunity to partner with BGCSF, a nationally recognized organization whose values stand in support of youth betterment. Boys & Girls Clubs of San Francisco, founded in 1891 on Harrison St. in SOMA, provides youth with high-quality programs and support services that allow Club members to be “ready for life” at age 18. BGCSF’s mission is to inspire and enable all young people, especially those from disadvantaged circumstances, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. Armistead, who built his company from the ground up at age 27, believes that the values of both Happy Moose Juice and BGCSF are well aligned.

“Happy Moose Juice was born out of a dream and sheer determination,” Armistead said. “We started with very little funding and bootstrapped our way to where we are today. We can draw on that experience to relate to these young people and teach them how to start their own businesses, launch a product from the ground up, and help them discover and explore their passions. We are committed to serving our community by offering what we do best: health & happiness!”

Germaine Bond, Willie Mays Clubhouse director echoed Armistead’s passion. “Seeds are being planted in the lives of our teens who will soon be young adults. Many life lessons are being learned,” she said.

Happy Moose Juice is dedicated to crafting the world’s best juice and to cultivate happiness in anyone we have the opportunity to share our juice with. We accomplish this by merging socially conscious values with a business mission which provides strong investor returns, while also being responsible stewards of our planet and each other. This is evidenced today through many means: By maintaining a steadfast commitment to creating delicious, fresh and healthful beverages; By utilizing imperfect produce for cold-pressing juices to help fight food waste; By helping to bridge the opportunity gap for disenfranchised youth through mentoring.

Boys & Girls Clubs of San Francisco inspires and enables all young people, especially those from disadvantaged circumstances, to realize their full potential as productive, responsible and caring citizens. We believe that young people will achieve extraordinary things when they are provided with skilled and caring staff, fun and effective programs, and first-class facilities in an environment that promotes respect, responsibility and fun. Through our programs, services, and strong personal relationships with youth, BGCSF instills in young people:
• A sense of competence – the feeling there is something youth can do well.
• A sense of usefulness – the opportunity to do something of value for other people.
• A sense of belonging – a place where youth know they are accepted and welcomed.
• A sense of power or influence – a chance to be heard and to influence decisions.",Happy Moose Juice Partners with Boys & Girls Clubs of San Francisco to Launch New Bottled Smoothie

Following the completion of its three-year ,2019-05-15,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10114953/REEDS_970.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/reeds-strong-virgils-sales-drive-q1-growth,"Following the completion of its three-year recovery plan, Reed’s Inc. announced yesterday growing sales across its product portfolio in its first quarter 2019 earnings report.

The company generated $8.4 million in net sales during the first quarter, up 2% from 2018. Sales of the core Reed’s Ginger Beer line declined 8% while craft soda Virgil’s grew 46%. Total sales for both lines were up 14%. Gross profit increased 9% to $2.5 million and gross margin increased 185 basis points to 30%.

The company reported operating losses of $2.9 million, compared to $1.1 million in 2018. About $1 million of the losses was due to increased investment in sales and marketing to support Reed’s recent new product launches. Net loss was $3.3 million, up from $1.6 million last year.

Speaking to investors and analysts during a conference call yesterday, Reed’s CEO Val Stalowir said the sales growth came prior to the rollout of several new Reed’s Ginger Beer products which launched at Natural Products Expo West 2019 in March and began hitting store shelves in April. Alongside new packaging for the core line, the company also introduced zero sugar and CBD-infused SKUs, along with ready-to-drink alcoholic “Ginger Mule” products.

Reed’s is also preparing to launch a line of ginger wellness shots later this year. Stalowir said the products, which include other functional ingredients, are in the “final stages” of formulation.

“Our organizational focus is now completely zeroed in on building our brands, executing on our innovation plans, opening incremental retail outlets, and accelerating sales growth,” Stalowir said. “We have demonstrated with the acceleration of Virgil’s that our innovation and sales efforts can drive incremental growth, and we’re now executing our Reed’s innovation and marketing plans. We have the capital, the team, and support partnerships in place to successfully execute these plans.”

According to Stalowir, Reed’s added several new retail chain accounts in the first quarter, including Walmart, Gelson’s, Bashas, Lawson’s, Harmon’s, and Ingles. This month the company also added two Costco regions for both the Reed’s and Virgil’s lines.

The company is currently working to build out its distributor network and is seeking to partner with beer and nonalcoholic DSD distributors in the Southeast, Midwest, and South Central regions, as well as Canada. Reed’s is also increasing its on-premise channel strategy, which added more than 500 restaurant, bar, and nightclub accounts over the past year.

“There’s a lot of opportunity and work that needs to be done,” Stalowir said in the Q&A portion of the call. “Reed’s, the innovation is on the core, it just started this month and so the new can lines are going into new channels, the zero sugars [are] going hopefully everywhere in both bottles and cans, that’s going to require a lot of focus and effort and support over the next 12 months to 18 months to really take full advantage of the opportunity there.”

The report comes on the heels of the company moving its stock listing from NYSE American to NASDAQ on Friday. As part of a new multi-channel marketing campaign tied to the move, the company purchased digital billboards in Times Square with the ginger beer line’s new tagline “Ready for Real Ginger?” According to Stalowir, Reed’s plans to focus the campaign in key markets including New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Diego with digital, outdoor, print, and radio advertising, along with social media, instore displays, coupons, and sampling events.

This Colorado Honey Whisky isn’t a saccharine-sweet flavored whisky, but a true straight whisky finished in aged honey barrels.

Spirit Hound and Bee Squared Apiaries have developed a unique process during which raw honey is aged in spent whisky barrels for 100 days. Each honey-filled barrel is rotated daily, by hand, to maximize absorption of whisky and oak essence, producing a very limited release Whisky Barrel Aged Honey. The emptied honey barrel then returns to Spirit Hound, where it is filled with a finished (two-year-old) whisky and aged for three additional months. Each unique barrel is individually bottled with a delightfully balanced, rich, not-too-sweet whisky that showcases the true depth of this Colorado collaboration.

“Finishing our straight malt whisky in used honey barrels is a natural way for us to accentuate the honey notes that we get in our whisky normally,” said Craig Engelhorn, head distiller and mad scientist at Spirit Hound. “We get amplified flavors and enjoyable honey characters without being overly sweet.”

The Straight Malt Whisky (Spirit Hound prefers the “e”-free spelling on its whisky, noting a respectful nod to Scotch whisky and the 100-percent malted barley recipe) in the collaboration has been aged for over two years in new, fully charred American oak barrels before being bottled in an unblended “single-barrel” fashion.

“The barrel-aged honey process that we’ve developed allows the honey to remain raw—unheated—for maximum flavor,” said Beth Conrey, owner of Bee Squared Apiaries. “Our partnership with Spirit Hound is a wonderful ‘full-circle’ collaboration that our clients truly appreciate and makes for a great honey and a great whisky!”

9 oz. Jars of the Bee Squared Whisk(e)y Barrel Aged Honey will be available at the tasting room event and for order via the Bee Squared Apiaries website.

Spirit Hound’s Colorado Honey Whisky is available in limited quantities throughout Colorado at craft-centric bars and restaurants (on-premise), and liquor stores (off-premise). 750 ML Bottles sell for a suggested retail price of $65.00.

To celebrate the release of the Honey Whisky, Spirit Hound Distillers will be hosting a slew of events throughout Colorado during the month of May. Guests are invited to meet the Spirit Hound team, sample Neat or On-Ice pours along with specialty cocktails featuring the Colorado Honey Straight Malt Whisky, and learn more about the origin of the distillery and its award-winning distinct flavors.
• When: May 16th, 2019 – 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.

Legacy Edition, which launched in 2018, presents limited-edition variations of labels used throughout the more than 150-year history of the brand.

Each unique label provides a tribute to the brand’s colorful history. Legacy Edition 2 marks the introduction of the first predominantly black color palette and includes a rope and anchor to symbolize Jack’s unmoving confidence. Three stars have been added to honor the distillery’s home state of Tennessee.

“Everyone recognizes Jack’s trademark black label, but very few realize that the Jack Daniel’s label has undergone many variations over the years, most of which looked very different from the one we know today,” said master distiller Jeff Arnett. “This second release in our Legacy Edition series is not only an ode to one of Jack’s first black labels, but also a symbolic celebration of our enduring spirit and commitment to a single great whiskey recipe for more than 150 years.”

The original version of the label that inspired Legacy Edition 2 featured a “medicinal use only” disclaimer, suggesting that this label was in use when alcohol was occasionally advertised to have medicinal properties, likely in the early 1900s. While this language won’t be featured on the Legacy Edition 2 label, much of its design remains true to the original inspiration.

Legacy Edition 2 is available nationwide and select markets internationally.

Officially registered by the U.S. Government in 1866 and based in Lynchburg, Tenn., the Jack Daniel Distillery, Lem Motlow, proprietor, is the first registered distillery in the United States and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Jack Daniel’s is the maker of the world-famous Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7 Tennessee Whiskey, Gentleman Jack Rare Tennessee Whiskey, Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Tennessee Whiskey, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Fire, Jack Daniel’s Sinatra Select and Jack Daniel’s Country Cocktails. Today, Jack Daniel’s is a true global icon found in more than 170 countries around the world and is the most valuable spirits brand in the world as recognized by Interbrand.

The Charlottesville, Va.-based brand first entered the retailer at a single store in April 2018, before adding about 20 more locations in September.

Speaking with BevNET this week, Snowing in Space co-founder Paul Dierkes said that early sales data showed the brand is performing “consistently” on the shelf, which he attributed to its colorful branding and a price point of $2.99 per 12 oz can. Dierkes said the brand negotiated with Whole Foods to reduce its price from its standard MSRP of $3.49.

“Our model is based on trying to move volume and velocity in the cold brew space,” Dierkes said. “What we want to do is get the price point to a spot where consumers are making this an everyday part of their consumption behavior and we think with the $3 price point people are going to be more willing to buy four, five, or six [cans] as opposed to one $5 can when they’re desperate for some caffeine.”

The company has also added independent retailers throughout the Mid-Atlantic — including grocery, convenience, and fitness channel accounts — which are self-serviced cold chain by the company.

In addition to its RTD products, Snowing in Space also self-distributes its cold brew in kegs to office and on-premise accounts on the East Coast, as well as providing service for regional coffee roasters including Counter Culture, Mudhouse, and Black Hand. Dierkes said the company is preparing to “amp up” his company’s keg business this year in Virginia, Maryland, and D.C. markets.

“We control the distribution, we manage and provide all the equipment, so we’re controlling the process from beginning to end just to make sure that the quality is there,” Dierkes said. “I think that’s why a lot of roasters have outsourced that process to us. Because on a smaller scale it’s really hard to do a consistent nitro cold brew coffee and we’re building out a way for people to get access to that.”

New Jersey-based nitro cold brew coffee maker Nitro Beverage Co. has partnered with Rainforest Distribution to service the Northeast region.

Speaking to BevNET, Nitro CEO Ali Mohamed said the partnership will allow the Asbury Park, N.J.-based brand to expand with retail chains including 7-Eleven and Whole Foods. Mohamed said the company will focus on expanding to all New Jersey Whole Foods locations before expanding into the broader Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, in addition to entering new retailers serviced by Rainforest.

“Our goal this year is to increase our brand awareness and our presence in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic region,” Mohamed told BevNET. “Since we rolled our RTD SKUs out last year it’s been just self-distribution, so our reach hasn’t gotten too far out of New Jersey. Now that we’re working with Rainforest it’s our goal to expand our presence and by the end of the year be all over the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic.”

In addition to Rainforest, Nitro recently added keg distributor Liquid Life to service on-premise and corporate office accounts in California , Mohamed said.

Botanical-infused sparkling water brand Petal is initiating a nationwide distribution expansion plan, targeting independent and chain accounts across the country, including California universities, Albertsons, Jewel, Jimbo’s, Cost Plus World Market and Gelson’s.

Speaking with BevNET, CEO Candice Crane said Petal — which launched in May 2018 — will also target California universities and other chain retailers in the natural, conventional and specialty channels as part of the plan. She said she anticipates the brand will be in roughly 1,000 points of distribution by fall and has signed on with UNFI and KeHE.

“Brand awareness is key as consumers are slowly but surely beginning to recognize the botanical category as something here to stay, not just a trend,” Crane said. “We’re really proud that conventional stores like Albertson’s are placing us in their organic aisle and we’re proud to be leading the organic botanical category.”

This expression is part of the annual Master’s Collection series, which celebrates Master Distiller Chris Morris’ vision and Woodford Reserve’s commitment to innovation and craftsmanship within the bourbon and whiskey category.",2019-05-16,,https://www.bevnet.com/news/spirits/2019/woodford-reserve-launches-batch-proof/,"VERSAILLES, Ky.— Woodford Reserve is proud to release its annual limited-edition, high-proof expression — Woodford Reserve Batch Proof. This expression is part of the annual Master’s Collection series, which celebrates Master Distiller Chris Morris’ vision and Woodford Reserve’s commitment to innovation and craftsmanship within the bourbon and whiskey category.

First introduced in 2018, Batch Proof celebrates Woodford Reserve proprietary batching process — blending barrels and then presenting the liquid at its actual proof, which this year is 123.2.

Batch Proof is crafted using the same grain bill and process as Woodford Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon. However, Batch Proof takes Woodford Reserve’s trademark flavor range of sweet vanilla and toasted oak to a whole new level — providing consumers the privilege of tasting Woodford Reserve in its purest form (and not the standard 90.4 for which Woodford is known).

“Most people do not get to experience the intensity of the aromas and the smoothness of the whiskey at a higher proof point. With this innovative release, whiskey lovers will have the chance to taste Woodford Reserve the way the masters taste it,” Chris Morris said.

This limited-edition collection, available is selected U.S. and global markets, has suggested retail price of $129.99 for a 750mL bottle.
• Aroma: Rich oak, overripe banana and marzipan, with hints of orange oil dusted graham cracker and dried cherry.
• Taste: Dried apricot drizzled with rich dark chocolate layered over toasted hazelnuts and coffee with faint flavors of cinnamon and clove.

Tucked in the heart of thoroughbred country in Versailles, Kentucky, Woodford Reserve Distillery is a National Historic Landmark, which represents craftsmanship with a balance of historic heritage and modern practices. Woodford Reserve is the Presenting Sponsor of The Kentucky Derby and is a product of the Brown-Forman Corporation, a premier producer and marketer of fine quality beverage alcohol brands including Jack Daniel’s, Finlandia, Korbel, Tequila Herradura, Sonoma-Cutrer and Chambord.

The addition of these distillers expands Sunshine State’s growing portfolio of craft spirits.

“Partnering with each of these spirit brands achieves our most important goal: to satisfy palates throughout Central Florida,” said Chris Larue, president and founder of Sunshine State Distributing. “Siempre, Alpine and Perfect Vodka are all high-quality spirits we think our customers are going to love.”

Siempre Tequila offers both an anejo and blanco tequila, each a beautiful expression of the spirit. The Siempre Anejo is aged for 24 months in American oak barrels, giving the tequila a smooth, sweet flavor, while the unaged and award-winning Siempre Plata shows notes of citrus and pepper.

From Alpine Distilling comes Persistent Vodka, Summit Gin, Spur Whiskey, Preserve Liqueur and Park City Special Bourbon Whiskey finished in IPA barrels. This award-winning line-up is influenced by the founder and master distiller’s roots that stretch from Kentucky and Louisiana all the way to Great Britain and Germany, before settling in Park City, Utah, where the distillery is based.

Perfect Vodka lives up to its name with clean flavor and all-natural ingredients. This spirit is five-times distilled using responsibly sourced wheat from the Brie Champagne region of France. Perfect Vodka is gluten-free, non-GMO and ideal for classic cocktails.

Distribution of Siempre Tequila, Alpine Distilling and Perfect Vodka will begin this month to bars, restaurants, and retail stores throughout Orange, Osceola, Polk, Brevard, Lake, Seminole, Volusia, and Flagler counties.

Since co-founding Vita Coco in 2004, Kirban has guided the brand to domination in the coconut water space. Distributed over four continents, Vita Coco holds a 26 percent share of the global market for coconut water, which is estimated to be worth $2.5 billion, according to market research firm Euromonitor. Success has attracted many suitors over the years — PepsiCo was reportedly in talks to acquire the brand in 2017 — yet Vita Coco has remained independent, a key component of Kirban’s plan to build upon the company’s foundation and develop a beverage platform focused on better-for-you brands.

“My goal over the next couple of years is to have four or five totally unique brands in-house under (Vita Coco parent company) All Market Inc. that play in different sub-segments of this healthier, functional drinks market,” Kirban said. “Coke and Pepsi are really good at certain things, and they’ve done quite a lot of M&A in this functional beverage space, but their share of better-for-you beverages continues decline. It’s not what they’re good at. It’s not what they’re focused on. I believe that opens up this lane for us to just drive right through as we should be the ones who really create the better-for-you beverage company for the next generation.”

Within our wide-ranging interview, Kirban also discussed his leadership style, why he hires based on attitude over skill set and how Vita Coco considers innovation and potential acquisitions. He also explained what motivates him to personally invest in brands, and why living close to his office is key to work-life balance.

"Thanks to new technology, Mid-Atlantic coffee brewer and cold brew keg provider Commonwealth Joe thinks it may have found the answer to overcoming the high upfront costs of keg placement: pay-as-you-go.",2019-05-16,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/16151253/DMVcoldbrew_970.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/help-yourself-vending-tech-aims-to-solve-keg-cold-brews-cost-issues,"Thanks to new technology, Mid-Atlantic coffee brewer and cold brew keg provider Commonwealth Joe thinks it may have found the answer to overcoming the high upfront costs of keg placement: pay-as-you-go.

The Arlington, Va.-based company, which roasts, brews and provides kegs of cold brew to clients on the East Coast, is one of several partners across the country working with Smart Beverages Technologies (SBT) as a provider of the company’s Kegerator Vending Machines (KVM), an innovative self-serve concept that aims to address one of the major hurdles to cold brew providers.

“The number one reason why people say ‘no’ to buying our product is cost,” said Commonwealth Joe CEO Robert Peck.

For a company like Commonwealth Joe, which has primarily serviced office accounts since launching in 2012, the KVM is an opening to a more flexible business model. Traditionally, Commonwealth Joe charged offices upfront for full kegs, which were then given out to employees as a free perk. Instead, the KVM allows Peck’s company to collect revenue directly on a pay-per-pour basis at no cost to the provider; users simply swipe a credit card and go. By removing one of the major barriers to entry, the idea is that new placement opportunities — in locations such as gyms, apartment buildings, convention centers and college campuses— will begin to open up.

“A lot of locations reach out and ask if there’s a way to cost share with our gym members or our residents — and we’d say we wish we did but we don’t,” said Peck. “One of the reasons that the vending was so exciting is it allowed us to reach those new customers.”

In San Diego-based SBT, Commonwealth Joe found a partner that was also eager to leverage technology to expand its presence in cold brew. Coming from the company’s experience developing hot food vending machines and other self-service platforms, SBT CEO O’Neil Sawh said the lack of viable options in the keg service model left him “shocked.”

“It was confusing for us because we had been running kiosk businesses where we would see and track everything online,” Sawh said. “I’m not sure how you can scale to hundreds or thousands of locations and not have visibility on the keg, in terms of pressure and liquid levels. The basic insights on each device wasn’t [there] in this industry.”

The trick, according to Sawh, was how to turn the machine into a scalable and commercially viable platform. For that, the company installed real-time monitoring of its KVM units from a centralized dashboard, where it can anticipate issues, respond to problems, and use customer data to enhance service. Other features, such as automatic keg reordering, are also in the works. The company currently has 250 KVM units in operation nationwide. “If a driver goes to a location to change a keg and there’s 100 oz. left, you’ve lost one-sixth of the value of the keg,” Sawh said. “You do that to thousands of accounts, and it’s a lot of money. Just off that, we knew off just that we would have a business.”

Having such a fine level of control has also allowed providers to get creative with the KVM.

“We do have the ability to remotely adjust prices at will, which opens up some additional business models,” Peck said. “For example, when a customer of ours with multiple locations has a cold brew happy hour, we can change the machines to be free for employees after 10 a.m., so the company pays for it.”

In partnering with Commonwealth Joe, Sawh said the company’s team and corporate structure convinced him to grant the coffee roaster an exclusive license to use KVM east of the Mississippi River. However, he said the company was not seeking to make more exclusive agreements in the future; SBT also works with wholesalers including Blackbird Beverages, NOBL Coffee and Kombucha On Tap.

For Commonwealth Joe, leaning into new dispensing technologies that work in different channels was also good business sense; Peck acknowledged the move to secure an exclusive license with SBT was, at first, “more about defense” and protecting Commonwealth Joe’s existing customer base from rivals who might also be interested in the technology.

Working with the kegerators also brings challenges for a small operation; Peck said the company has had to take time training team members on how to use the machines, and initially leaned heavily on SBT for guidance. The units are expensive ($5,750), heavy (175 lbs. with an average size commercial kegerator), and can be cumbersome for a single delivery driver to move.

Yet Peck believes the platform has plenty of room to grow. The company currently has 40 KVM units in operation in New York and the District of Columbia, and recently began offering kombucha from GT’s and Marin Kombucha in addition to its own cold brew. As an indication of its commitment to fueling growth through KVM technology, the company recently closed $1.2 million on a $4 million funding round. It is also moving into new beverage categories, servicing GT’s Kombucha.

“The thing that is really nice about the vending is that you can sell for 25 to 40 cents an ounce,” Peck said. “When you are selling full kegs, you aren’t getting nearly that. The margins on the vending are much better, and the equipment is also much more expensive. We think there’s enough there to justify the vending, but it also depends on how much consumption there is.”",Help Yourself: Vending Tech Aims to Solve Keg Cold Brew’s Cost Issues
"Last week, Eater ",2019-05-16,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/16162248/Arizona_970.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/press-clips-the-cultural-influence-of-arizona-iced-tea,"The Dream of the ’90s Is Alive in AriZona Iced Tea

Last week, Eater analyzed the eternal cool factor of AriZona Iced Tea, the 99 cent 24 oz. gas station mainstay which hit shelves in 1992.

The brand has withstood the test of time, somehow avoiding the trappings of trendy 90s nostalgia to become what Eater calls simply “a mood.”

Originally launched to compete with established iced tea brands like Snapple, New York-based AriZona got its name because co-founders Don Vultaggio and John Ferolito thought it had a more pleasant connotation than its East Coast home. According to Vultaggio’s sons, their mother created the can design, drawing inspiration from the Southwestern style of the family home.

Since its launch, Eater points out that AriZona’s vivid aesthetic has helped it to establish a spot in the streetwear world. The company’s online store features products from hats to fanny packs to retro t-shirts adorned with its signature pastel cherry blossom design, and it opened a 99-cent store pop-up in New York last year which sold clothes and skateboards. The brand even sponsors a skate team of which Tony Hawk’s son, Riley, is a member.

AriZona’s influence has also expanded to other food and beverage channels. The iced tea brand was inspiration for Other Half Brewing’s 99¢ Tea IPA and this month, Mission Chinese Food’s Brooklyn branch is running a special a “Great Buy” menu that features AriZona products in two entrees, a cocktail and a dessert. According to the New York Times, the menu includes Green Tea noodles with chicken, offered at $9.99, and a 99-cent dessert featuring an AriZona Grapeade gelatin adorned with AriZona fruit snacks.

The restaurant’s chef Danny Bowen told the Times the promotion will help the restaurant reach a wider audience.

“We already appeal to people in the food world, but I really wanted to reach, like, kids that are familiar with Arizona to branch out and try something different,” he said.

Though AriZona’s colorful aesthetic aligns with today’s throwback culture, Eater posited that the brand’s bold design just might be timeless: Vultaggio’s son Wesley said the brand is planning to launch new fashion and lifestyle projects this summer.

This week, sparkling water brand LaCroix announced a new flavor, the first addition to the lineup since September 2017’s Key Lime, as reported on Grub Street.

Last Friday, LaCroix posted a teaser photo of a dark pink can on the brand’s Twitter, asking followers to share their best guesses, which ranged from strawberry kiwi to dragonfruit to cotton candy. On Monday, the brand announced the new flavor would be hibiscus, stylized as “HI-Biscus,” and will launch in the Western United States.

Grub Street compiled some of the reactions from LaCroix lovers on Twitter, and the responses were lukewarm at best. Several were skeptical of a flower-flavored sparkling water, while others speculated that the name “HI-Biscus” was being used to denote that no real hibiscus was used in the product. Some East Coast residents were simply frustrated because they wouldn’t be able to try out the new flavor.

Mineral water brand Perrier USA even weighed in, responding to a less-than-thrilled La Croix customer who had hoped the new flavor would be watermelon, replying: “Thirsty? We’ve got melons.”

Ginger beer brand Reed’s launched its first major marketing campaign ahead of Mother’s Day, AdAge reported, calling out the brand’s ginger ale rivals — mainly Canada Dry — for their ginger content, or lack thereof.

The “They Fooled Your Mom” campaign gets it name from mothers’ supposed dismay at discovering the lack of ginger in the ginger ale they give their children to settle their upset stomachs. The campaign points out that ginger isn’t identified as an ingredient in Canada Dry’s ginger ale, while each Reed’s 12 oz. ginger beer contains 3,000 to 9,000 mg of ginger. Reed’s website also links to an article on Bloomberg Law regarding Keurig Dr. Pepper’s $11.2 million settlement to resolve a class action suit disputing Canada Dry claims that the product is “made from real ginger.”

Lindsay Martin, Reed’s VP of marketing, told Ad Age that the company is aiming to garner attention by attracting the interest of Canada Dry consumers rather than facing off with ginger beer rivals like Gosling’s or Fever-Tree.

While Reed’s tops the ginger beer category, Canada Dry’s $577 million in sales last year dwarf’s Reed’s $23.7 million.

“We went to where awareness is,” said Martin.

She also told Ad Age that the brand’s vision is to be the “next generation ginger beverage.” Reed’s plans to introduce new hemp extract and zero sugar versions of ginger beer, along with ready-to-drink mules and ginger shots, later this year.

Vita Coco Threatens to Send Jar of Pee to Twitter Critic

Coconut water company Vita Coco took its snarky social media presence to a new level yesterday in response to a very vocal coconut water critic, according to Vox.

The spat began when amateur mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter Tony Posnanski, responding unprompted to a Vita Coco tweet, wrote: “I would rather drink your social media persons piss than coconut water.”

Quickly responding, Vita Coco tweeted “Address?” along with a photo of the brand’s community coordinator Lane Rawlings in a bathroom stall holding a Vita Coco jar containing what appeared to be pee.

Brand director Allison Finazzo confirmed to Vox that, despite Twitter skeptics speculating that the jar contained pineapple juice, it contained actual pee. She also said the tweet was a marketing stunt launched to support Vita Coco’s new Pressed Coconut Water, intended to taste more like actual coconuts than typical coconut water. The campaign, entitled “Impossible to Hate,” includes an initiative to call out the company’s critics on Twitter.

Finazzo said the company doesn’t take itself too seriously, and will continue using this humorous Twitter voice going forward.

“We all trust our instincts and know when something is toeing the line between provocative and inappropriate,” she said.

In response, Posnanski tweeted that he “got owned by coconut water” and told Huffpost that Vita Coco’s response was an “awesome comeback.”

While Finazzo said Posnanski did supply Vita Coco with his address, the company is sending him some of its new coconut water rather than a jar of urine.",Press Clips: The Cultural Influence of AriZona Iced Tea
"Philadelphia’s controversial “soda tax” has hurt sales and driven consumers outside of city limits to purchase sugar-sweetened beverages, according to a new study released this week.",2019-05-17,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/17103850/Soda-Tax_970-3.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/soda-tax-update-study-finds-philly-sales-down-by-half,"Philadelphia’s controversial “soda tax” has hurt sales and driven consumers outside of city limits to purchase sugar-sweetened beverages, according to a new study released this week.

The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), analyzed data from 291 chain retail locations in Philadelphia, including 54 supermarkets, 20 mass merchandise stores, and 217 pharmacies. The results found that sales of sugary beverages dropped 51% in the first year after the city’s soda tax took effect in 2017. The tax also led to an increase in beverage prices and a sharp decline in volume sales, dropping from 2.475 billion ounces in 2016 to 1.214 billion ounces in 2017, according to the report.

“The mean supermarket experienced a decline in combined sales of food and household products, driven by grocery items; mass merchandise stores and pharmacies were unaffected,” the study stated. “Supermarkets bordering Philadelphia, however, had an increase of similar magnitude in combined sales, so chains with stores both inside Philadelphia and just across the border might not have experienced significant business losses.”

The study was funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, an organization founded by former New York City mayor and soda tax proponent Michael Bloomberg. According to Philly.com, Bloomberg has contributed to the re-election campaign of Mayor Jim Kenney, whose office has been a strong advocate for the tax.

The tax has resulted in significant sales declines for some Philadelphia distributors;however, the drop has not been as steep as the 51% decline for chain retailers. Metro Beverage president Andy Cimochowski told BevNET his Philadelphia business has dropped by about 30% since the law took effect, prompting the Bensalem, Pa.-based distributor to focus more on communities outside of Philadelphia’s borders.

Cimochowski added that grocery buyers have turned to buying beverages in bulk from outside of the city, leading to a rise in sellers within border towns. The tax has also created a black market, he said, with unlicensed distributors running cash businesses within Philadelphia to get around the tax.

“You see these white trucks and vans parked all over these stores delivering all sorts of different beverages,” Cimochowski said. “I’ve had certain stores who won’t buy certain products from me because they can get it from somebody who won’t charge the tax.”

Ben Cicione, general manager of Philadelphia distributor Cision Beverage Co., told BevNET that, like Metro, his sales have also dropped by roughly a third since the tax went into effect.

Though the impact of the tax has hurt both businesses, Cimochowski and Cicione each said the declines have largely levelled off. According to Cicione, many distributors and retailers in Philadelphia have begun to embrace the taxes as a new normal.

“There’s nothing we can do, we can’t just move out of the city,” Cicione said. “So we’re focusing on the water [category], and our association, the American Beverages Association, keep fighting.”

As soda slumps, other categories have benefitted. According to Cicione, sales of flavored sparkling water have increased since the tax went into effect and the company has worked to increase sales of its sparkling water products, including Nestlé brands such as San Pellegrino and Poland Spring. Cimochowski, however, said he believes “there’s zero shift in what people are drinking” and that consumers are either paying the higher price or making trips outside of the city.

According to Philly.com, Mayor Jim Kenney’s office has said the tax is fulfilling its intended purpose of funding public programs. Mike Dunn, a spokesman for the mayor, told the website that the study proves that the tax is not always passed through to consumers and that retailers and distributors can choose to pay the tax themselves. He added that the mayor’s office believes “the beverage industry will spin this study to be more than it is.”

The Tuesday release of the JAMA study coincided with a report from KOMO News that Seattle anticipates it will raise just under $24 million from its soda tax in 2019, an increase from $22.2 million last year. However, city budget director Ben Noble said during a meeting of the Select Committee on Budgets of the Seattle City Council this week that the city does not have data to prove consumption of sugary beverages has declined.",Soda Tax Update: Study Finds Philly Sales Down by Half

It may sound like an oxymoron, but a growing cohort of healthier alcoholic beverages have been finding a receptive audience in recent years. Often promoted as low-calorie, low-carb, or infused functional benefits, these products are resonating with a growing number of consumers focused on health and wellness.

That’s certainly the case for Boochcraft, a three-year-old hard kombucha brand that has been making waves in its home market of Southern California. In an interview included in this episode, Boochcraft co-founder and CMO Adam Hiner said that while the company originally believed that its consumers would be traditional kombucha drinkers, “we were blown away by the diversity of [people] that we’ve attracted, some of which have never had kombucha.”

“It’s broadened our scope of the way we can talk about the product and the way we can market it.” he said.

As part of our conversation, Hiner discussed the origins of the brand and shared his perspective on the trend of healthier drinking. He also spoke about why Boochcraft is resonating with consumers beyond those that are regular kombucha drinkers, the challenges of forecasting demand for a nascent category, and why he sees the company as competing against itself.",Ep. 162: How This Boozy Booch Got Ahead of a Hot Trend

“These study results reaffirm the value we bring to coffee brands, namely that our patented technology can extract the richest cold brew coffee flavor, while allowing the fresh taste experience to last for months after production,” said Lou Vastardis, BKON. “Our RAIN technology unlocks the potential for major growth in the cold brew industry; now, coffee brands can scale packaged cold brew without sacrificing freshness, including single-origin coffees that exhibit distinct, recognizable flavor characteristics.”

Continued Vastardis: “We witnessed this trend in the craft beer market, when consumer preferences shifted in favor of fresh, locally-brewed micro-beers, and we’re now poised to again bear witness to it in the cold brew coffee market, now that the technology is in place to offer a packaged product that stays fresh for the requisite amount of time.”

To test for freshness, BKON partnered with a leading coffee company to simultaneously evaluate the sensory qualities of two RAIN-brewed coffee products on an ongoing basis. Over a period of 12 months, flavor and aroma testing was completed by experts at BKON and the partnering coffee roaster. Both parties concluded that the desirable and distinguishing qualities of each product remained consistent for over four months, with fresh, consistent flavor through 120 days for one SKU and 180 days for the other SKU.

“The growing popularity of cold brew continues to be fueled by a consumer demand for ready-to-drink and on-tap coffee beverages,” Vastardis explained, “but while cold brew represents a new, significant chapter for the industry, flavor degradation has historically prevented coffee brands from protecting and scaling optimal consumer experiences. We are proving that with RAIN, this roadblock is no longer the case.”

Additionally, BKON provided cans from their partner’s production run to third-party lab EMSL Analytical for microbiological analysis. The products were kept refrigerated and tested across three different time intervals for a variety of microbial organisms including lactic bacteria – which is primarily responsible for flavor souring. EMSL found that the cold brew coffee did not support the growth of any tested bacteria with undetectable levels up to 273 days – far surpassing the industry standard of 45 days.

“In a non-RAIN brewed cold brew, the pH shifts in as little as 45 days due to the growth of lactic bacteria,” Vastardis said. “As it begins to grow, it eventually turns sour, leaving it unrecognizable compared with its fresh-brewed counterpart. As a result, brands have been forced to choose between limiting their distribution, or heat-treating the coffee which flattens the flavor and fails to deliver the fresh-brewed experience consumers expect.”

While other cold brew methods rely on suspending coffee particles in water, RAIN uses a much more advanced process to extract every succulent note from any ingredient a beverage producer wants to extract into liquid. First, a vacuum removes the gases from the ingredient’s structure. Water is then infused into the empty spaces, where it absorbs the flavors and aromas contained in the ingredients. By controlling the strength, duration and frequency of vacuum cycles, RAIN extracts far more flavor than traditional brewing methods.

“Through the findings of this study, we’ve proven that a higher standard of packaged cold brew is now attainable,” concluded Vastardis. “Consumers can experience the promise of freshness and distinguishable flavors months after production, and coffee brands can now expand the reach and scale of their cold supply product line by replicating what our current partners have achieved.”

Alkazone Pet Water is an ultra-purified water with essential minerals that may increase your dog’s immunity, may help detoxify and supports natural body functions. Pet owners that serve Alkazone Pet Water to their dogs may also see no more yellow spots on their lawn, as the alkaline water reduces the acidity of urine.

The newest version of Alkazone Alkaline Water is the most cost-effective way to drink alkaline water. The beverage boasts a high pH due to a proprietary mineral blend and does not include sodium. This lifestyle superwater is a premium product for active, healthy lifestyles. For more information on Alkazone products, visit alkazone.com.

“Water is essential for life, but not all bottled waters can boost support of your overall health, enhance your immune system and balance your pH,” said Robert Kim, founder and CEO, Alkazone. “For 25 years, health conscious consumers have chosen Alkazone products because our water provides the simplest and most effective way to drink electrolytes, antioxidants and minerals. We are looking forward to expanding our reach with the release of our new Alkaline Water. And because wellness for the entire family matters, we are happy to introduce Alkazone Pet Water.”

lkazone also announces the addition of Michael J. O’Donnell as the Vice President of Sales. O’Donnell brings a wealth of experience working within the consumer goods industry, including Anheuser-Busch Inc., Nestlé Waters North America and Mountain Valley Spring Water.

The development of Alkazone changed the concept of drinking water. Consumers “drink with purpose,” lubricating their bodies with essential minerals to balance the alkaline levels in the body that come with today’s eating habits and modern lifestyle. The essential mineral ingredients used in Alkazone products are carefully chosen functional-antioxidants to rid the body of free radicals. As such, these proprietary formulas bolster the immune system which in turn can reduce the probability of contracting many common ailments such as diabetes, gout, hypertension, osteoporosis and cancer. Disease cannot function in a high alkaline environment and Alkazone helps raise the pH levels in the body. At 9.5 pH, this balanced antioxidant water provides efficient hydration with a crispy taste and a higher pH. Alkazone water includes potassium, magnesium, zinc, calcium and selenium (an essential trace mineral).

Alkazone launched with alkaline mineral drops and in 1994. In July 1996, Alkazone introduced the waterionizer for home faucets. The company developed the brand’s antioxidant bottled mineral water formula in October 2009 and launched Alkazone Antioxidant bottled mineral water in March 2010. Since then, Alkazone has continued to rapidly expand its global footprint and product line, which today includes antioxidant mineral drops such as magnesium, potassium and zinc. The Company has international distribution in Canada, China, Europe, and several South American countries.

Alkazone products are available for purchase in the United States at select grocery stores including ShopRite, Whole Foods, Kings, Publix and online through Amazon. Alkazone Pet Water is available in 16.9 oz. (retail price: $1.89) and 1 L (retail price: $2.89). Alkaline Water is available in 16.9 oz. (retail price: $1.69) and 1 L (retail price: $2.49).

".— In 1897, the federal government enacted The Bottled in Bond Act to help guarantee a spirit’s authenticity and quality. Fast forward more than 120 years, Nicole Austin – general manager and distiller of Cascade Hollow Distilling Co. – is trying her hand at this special offering and reinforcing George Dickel’s commitment to making unique, high quality whisky available at a great value with the release of George Dickel Bottled in Bond as her first innovation since joining the company in 2018.",2019-05-17,,https://www.bevnet.com/news/spirits/2019/george-dickel-enters-bottled-in-bond-category-with-13-year-old-limited-release/,"TULLAHOMA, Tenn.— In 1897, the federal government enacted The Bottled in Bond Act to help guarantee a spirit’s authenticity and quality. Fast forward more than 120 years, Nicole Austin – general manager and distiller of Cascade Hollow Distilling Co. – is trying her hand at this special offering and reinforcing George Dickel’s commitment to making unique, high quality whisky available at a great value with the release of George Dickel Bottled in Bond as her first innovation since joining the company in 2018.

George Dickel Bottled in Bond Tennessee Whisky is a limited release, 13-year-old whisky that has already racked up a score of 95 (on a scale of 100) and earned the designation of “Best Buy” from Wine Enthusiast Magazine. Additionally, George Dickel Bottled in Bond took home a Gold medal this spring at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.

At 100-proof (50% ABV), George Dickel Bottled in Bond offers a bold and assertive profile with a well-balanced finish highlighted by tastes of light honey, tropical fruit, warm spices and a touch of leather. George Dickel Bottled in Bond has a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $35.99, making it a must-try for whisky lovers.

The first bottles of George Dickel Bottled in Bond will be available for purchase in the Bottle Shop at Cascade Hollow Distilling Co. this Friday, May 17, and then will roll out to retailers nationwide later in the month. For information on the distillery and Visitor’s Center, please visit georgedickel.com.

“We wanted George Dickel Bottled in Bond to be rooted in authenticity, quality and truth, reflective of the values we feel are most important when making Tennessee’s finest whisky,” said Austin. “The aged whisky stocks we have access to here at Cascade Hollow are absolutely beautiful, and it’s important to me that we create whisky that’s sure to be a great value for the quality you’re getting.”

To be labeled as Bottled in Bond, a spirit must be: composed only of the same class and type of spirits, the product of one distillation season by one distillery (distilled by Cascade Hollow Distilling Co. at Cascade Hollow Distillery, DSP-TN-2, during the fall season of 2005), unaltered from the original condition or character, stored in oak containers a federally bonded warehouse under U.S. government supervision (stored at Cascade Hollow Distillery in Tullahoma, TN) for at least four years (13 years old) and bottled at 100 proof (50% ABV) and reduced in proof only by the addition of water to not less than 100 proof. George Dickel Bottled in Bond has been aged and bottled according to this special set of regulations from the U.S. government’s Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits.

While Nicole Austin recommends first trying the whisky neat or on the rocks to realize the full flavor profile, George Dickel Bottled in Bond can also lend a beautiful backbone to popular cocktails like the Old Fashioned or Manhattan.

George Dickel Bottled in Bond has a mash bill of 84% corn, 8% rye and 8% malted barley. It is chill charcoal mellowed like the rest of the George Dickel Tennessee Whisky portfolio, which helps it get that the smooth mouthfeel for which the brand is best known.

As with all the whiskies in the George Dickel family, your friends at Cascade Hollow encourage you to sip this new offering the same way it’s made – slowly and responsibly.

Back in the late 1800’s, George Dickel worked to fulfill his dream for crafting the smoothest Tennessee Whisky around. Over a century later, we continue to honor George’s timeless values and tradition. Legend has it that early on George discovered that whisky made in the cold winter months tasted smoother. Today we honor this tradition by chilling our whisky before filtering it through sugar-maple charcoal so it’s mellow as moonlight just how George liked.

The acquisition will help Caliva to broaden its vertically-integrated cannabis business — which produces flower, vape, and oil products — into beverage through its access to Zola’s research and development team and established retail distribution network.",2019-05-17,https://dg6qn11ynnp6a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/17161458/Zola_970-2.jpg,https://www.bevnet.com/news/2019/zola-acquired-by-cannabis-brand-caliva,"Plant-based beverage maker Zola was acquired last week from investment group KarpReilly by California-based cannabis company Caliva for an undisclosed sum, the company announced today. The acquisition will help Caliva to broaden its vertically-integrated cannabis business — which produces flower, vape, and oil products — into beverage through its access to Zola’s research and development team and established retail distribution network.

Zola founder and CEO Chris Cuvelier will continue to lead the brand, in addition to taking the role of head of beverage for Caliva. Speaking to BevNET this week, Cuvelier said he will develop THC-infused beverages to be sold in California dispensaries under the Caliva trademark, as well as CBD-infused beverages under the Zola and Caliva brands for mainstream retailers nationwide. The company could also launch additional cannabis-infused beverage brands; however, there are currently no plans to develop THC-infused beverages under the Zola name.

“We are working to build out a portfolio of beverage brands infused with cannabis to be sold in our distribution channel in California,” Cuvelier said. “Simultaneously we’re developing those same branded products to sell to the mainstream market leveraging Zola’s existing team and infrastructure for distribution.”

Caliva has already begun developing drinks set for launch later this year and intends to have a beverage manufacturing facility operating by August, Cuvelier said.

Zola will also continue to produce and distribute its existing products, which include coconut water, acai juice, and natural energy drinks. Without providing specific details, Cuvelier said future products will be plant-based and may offer the brand an opportunity to expand its portfolio.

“We’ve got a unique opportunity to build a portfolio of brands that can gain product authenticity in the cannabis channel and can also be infused with hemp-based CBD in the mainstream markets,” he said. “We’ll likely create a Zola sub brand that focuses on CBD but leverages Zola’s positioning within plant-based beverages.”

According to Cuvelier, the two companies first came together when he and Caliva CEO Dennis O’Malley spoke on a panel about disruption in the beverage industry at the 2018 eBev Series conference in October. Cuvelier began consulting with Caliva in November, before deciding to sell the company earlier this year.

Zola was purchased by KarpReilly in 2016. In 2017 the company underwent a comprehensive rebrand, dubbed Zola 2.0, which established the brand’s identity of “plant-based hydration” and set the stage for broader distribution and new product launches including a Sparkling Energy Water line. The company’s products are currently available in more than 7,000 retail locations nationwide, including grocery, natural and specialty, and restaurant accounts.

Since launching in 2015, Caliva has established a presence in the burgeoning California cannabis market. The company owns a 110,000 square foot facility in San Jose which includes a genetics lab, 13 grow rooms, an oil extraction facility, and a dispensary. The company’s products are sold in at least 250 of California’s 500 dispensaries. Caliva currently operates its own DSD network with a 12 person sales team and a three person business development team, according to Cuvelier.

“The overall strategy for Caliva is to develop a democratic product portfolio for everybody at different consumer segments and price points,” Caliva CMO Stephen Matt told BevNET. The company, he said, has divided its product development into two segments — “Fun for You” recreational products and “Health and Wellness” products which will include CBD drinks as well as products to aid sleep, stress, and pain relief.

“Where Caliva is focused and positioned is on really being the number one most trusted lifestyle cannabis brand,” Cuvelier said. “They’re able to accomplish that by being totally vertically integrated.”",Zola Acquired by Cannabis Brand Caliva

"Booker’s Batch 2019-02 is an ode to a bygone distillery “tradition” that helped inspire sixth generation Beam master distiller Booker Noe to create his namesake bourbon more than 30 years ago. Back then, some distillery rackhouse workers would sneak a taste or two of whiskey straight from an aging barrel using plastic tubing – called “mules” – that they carried in their overalls. In doing so, their bellies would rub on the side of the barrel, removing dust and shining it up. Some used to say, “the shiner the barrel, the sweeter the whiskey,” and those shiny barrels were often found in the center cut of the rackhouse where the temperature and humidity were just right.",2019-05-20,,https://www.bevnet.com/news/spirits/2019/bookers-bourbon-releases-bookers-batch-2019-02/,"CLERMONT, Ky.— Booker’s Batch 2019-02 is an ode to a bygone distillery “tradition” that helped inspire sixth generation Beam master distiller Booker Noe to create his namesake bourbon more than 30 years ago. Back then, some distillery rackhouse workers would sneak a taste or two of whiskey straight from an aging barrel using plastic tubing – called “mules” – that they carried in their overalls. In doing so, their bellies would rub on the side of the barrel, removing dust and shining it up. Some used to say, “the shiner the barrel, the sweeter the whiskey,” and those shiny barrels were often found in the center cut of the rackhouse where the temperature and humidity were just right.

When Booker Noe was ready to lay down the first barrels of the bourbon that would eventually bear his name, he knew it had to be in the same area of the rackhouse as “the shiny barrels” – that’s where the good stuff was. And while the days of mules are long gone, Seventh Generation Master Distiller Fred Noe still ages Booker’s Bourbon barrels in the middle floors of the rackhouses to uphold Booker’s high standards.

Like all batches of Booker’s Bourbon, Booker’s “Shiny Barrel Batch” was selected by Fred Noe to ensure it upholds the qualities and standards that fans of the brand have come to know and love. Uncut and unfiltered, this batch was chosen with the following characteristics:
• Batch Notes: Booker’s “Shiny Barrel Batch” offers a sweet nose with a beautiful chestnut color and rich vanilla notes that are signature of Booker’s Bourbon. The finish is medium and warm.
• Sipping Suggestions: Booker’s “Shiny Barrel Batch” is best enjoyed neat, over ice or with a few drops of water.

Booker’s Bourbon is one of the only bourbons available today that is bottled uncut at its natural proof, yielding an intense flavor and nose that is one-of-a-kind. Inspired by a 200-year-old family tradition, Booker Noe, Jim Beam’s grandson and 6th GenerationMaster Distiller, first created Booker’s Bourbon as a Christmas gift for his close friends and family. Taking barrels found in the center-cut of the rackhouse, Booker bottled the bourbon straight-from-the-barrel, creating Booker’s Bourbon, a true barrel bourbon. Today, Master Distiller Fred Noe personally tastes and selects every batch of Booker’s Bourbon before it is bottled to ensure that it matches Booker’s personal preference for a robust and full-bodied whiskey.

The 2019 Batch Collection will feature four batch releases, each released in limited quantities and featuring a unique label and batch name honoring founding distiller Booker Noe, his love of family and his spirit of experimentation.

Booker’s “Shiny Barrel Batch” is available nationwide beginning in May in limited quantities with a SRP of $79.99 for a 750 mL bottle. For more information on Booker’s Bourbon, visit BookersBourbon.com",Booker's Bourbon Releases Booker's Batch 2019-02

The cordials join an expanding Destillaré line-up that already includes Orange Curaçao and Pomegranate liqueurs.",2019-05-20,,https://www.bevnet.com/news/spirits/2019/copper-kings-launches-two-new-destillare-luxury-liqueurs/,"LOUISVILLE, Ky.— Louisville-based Copper & Kings American Brandy Co. has announced its two latest pure copper pot-distilled luxury cordials: Destillaré Café, an intense coffee liqueur built with a robust cold brew natural coffee foundation; and Destillaré Chocolat, an intense chocolate liqueur using cocoa nibs steeped in brandy process. The cordials join an expanding Destillaré line-up that already includes Orange Curaçao and Pomegranate liqueurs.

Both liqueurs use an aged Copper & Kings American Brandy base, have no added artificial colors or flavors, and are non-chill filtered. The liqueurs are at Destillaré’s standard 90 proof and are sweetened with honey.

“Destillaré’s mission is to provide bartenders with exceptional tools to build the most delicious, inventive cocktails that they possibly can,” said Copper & Kings founder, Joe Heron. “Bartenders have thirsty imaginations, and we see them as the most inventive alchemists and magicians. Cordials are very exciting for us, not only for the creative palette they provide, but that for a category of such enormous size, there’s not been a lot of new thinking and innovation, and bartenders are looking for tools to expand their own repertoires.”

Master distiller Brandon O’Daniel described Destillaré’s process: “With Café, we take certified fair-trade cold brew made from Arabica coffee beans and add it to the aged brandy in the barrel. We then marry the liquids in the barrels for 6-9 months, adding extra Madagascan vanilla beans, Cardamom pods and coffee beans in the barrel. The spirit is then diluted to proof using cold brew coffee instead of water. Chocolat uses a similar process, but with added Caribbean cocoa nibs in the barrel, also for 6-9 months, and then diluted with a custom steeping of cocoa nibs in reverse osmosis filtered water. They are very balanced, very smooth, highly aromatic, and viscous without being syrupy and sticky.”

Copper & Kings creative director, Ron Jasin said: “The word Destillaré is the Latin root word for distillation, and our packaging design reflects an alembic, alchemical personality. The way we make our intense liqueurs is in many ways a magical art, and like all things Copper & Kings, we break the mold in small and big ways. They are high proof elixirs – they don’t follow the history of low proof, sweet and syrupy cordials – they have the confidence to stand on their own as distinctive, singular spirits, and most importantly, they give bartenders the capability of making their own magic. They are very, very true to their essence. The coffee or chocolate aromas stick around in the glass for ages, you can smell it across the bar.”

Destillaré Café is recommended for a rich Espresso Martini, or a White Russian that “The Dude” would approve of. Destillaré Chocolat is delicious in an elevated, classic Brandy Alexander, and makes a remarkable Dark Sidecar or Margarita Negra with mezcal. When combined, the liqueurs make a delightful Brandy Alejandro, or Oaxaca Mocha with mezcal. It need not be said that they are tailor-made for the most indulgent boozy milkshakes.

Available across Copper & Kings national distribution footprint and at the distillery.

Copper & Kings American Gin, Brandy, Absinthe and Destillaré liqueurs are double-distilled exclusively in copper pot stills, and are non-chill filtered and unadulterated. The full portfolio of the fine distilled spirits includes:

Copper & Kings American Brandy Co. distribution footprint includes the following 36 markets: Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Washington D.C.

Copper & Kings uses small batch copper pot-distillation to forge untraditional, non-derivative, pure pot-distilled American apple and grape brandies, absinthe, gin and Destillaré liqueurs that are non-chill filtered with no added sugar, colors, artificial flavors, or synthetic chemicals.

“With the addition of these markets, Brockmans has now expanded its footprint beyond the Northeast to the South, Midwest and West regions,” said Neil Everitt, co-founder and CEO of Brockmans Gin. “Brockmans was created to be more exciting, different and delicious than the traditional gins of the past. The distinct character of our award-winning gin has enjoyed tremendous success and exceeded expectations throughout the world. We are thrilled to partner with Blue Ridge and our new distributors to offer our distinctive, new style gin ‘Like no Other’ to retailers, on-premise accounts and ultimately consumers in our expansion markets.”

Brockmans signature taste is created with a blend of botanicals including blackberries, blueberries, coriander, bittersweet orange peel and juniper berries. This combination of botanicals is steeped in pure grain spirit for up to 24 hours to release the flavors and then distilled in a traditional copper still. Conventional gin aromas of juniper and angelica marry with the refreshing citrus flavors and the rounder top notes of blueberry and blackberry resulting in a gin that is so smooth it can be enjoyed on its own over ice or as the primary ingredient in a range of classic and contemporary cocktails.”

Brockmans Gin has been awarded Gold Medals in three prestigious international competitions including the inaugural Global Spirits Awards, the 2017 SIP awards and the 2017 International Craft Spirits Awards. It is available in 750ml at a suggested retail price of $34.99. For more information, visit brockmansgin.com.

Brockmans Gin is a super-premium, new style gin, which can be enjoyed neat over ice.

Based in the United Kingdom, Brockmans is now available in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri and Colorado.","Brockmans Gin Expands Distribution South, Midwest and West"

Portland, Ore.-based Smith Teamaker was founded in 2009 by Steven Smith, a legendary figure in the tea world best known as the creator of Tazo. The company is renowned for its expertise in blending and commitment to high quality sourcing, as well as its contribution in defining world standards for the tea industry.

In our interview, Marshall and Kroesen discussed how Smith Teamaker has continued to grow based on the principles of “craft, creativity and origin” laid down by its founder, who died in 2015. They also explore how the company has continued to drive innovation despite its relatively small size.

“As a small business, we have not only an opportunity but an obligation to push the envelope and to create things that others might not have the ability to do,” Marshall said.

As part of our conversation, Marshall and Kroesen spoke about their unique career paths to Smith and their roles as stewards of its founder’s legacy. The pair also explained why the company is taking a patient approach to growth and why becoming a billion-dollar brand is not in their plans.",Insider Ep. 34: Why Small Businesses “Have An Obligation To Push The Envelope”

Oatly, a Swedish-based brand of oat milk and oat milk-based products, has been available in Europe for over 25 years and entered the American market in 2016. The U.S. launch was timed to meet surging interest in plant-based dairy alternatives, but while Oatly anticipated a strong start, the overwhelming demand for product was more than the company could handle. Just months after its debut, Oatly was faced with severe out-of-stock issues and enraged customers as it sought short and long-term solutions to its supply chain challenges.

Although Oatly has gotten back on track and is the leading brand in a thriving oat milk category, Mike Messersmith, the general manager of Oatly’s U.S. operations, was candid about the company’s early mistakes — and the likelihood that more will follow.

“We’ve already failed in the biggest ways possible; we’ll do it again,” he said in an interview included in this episode. “It’s all about progress,” Messersmith said. “Next week will be better than this week, a month from now will be better than that week. It will be messy. It’s always been messy. The thing I have to do more than correcting failure is reminding people — and remind myself — that it’s going to get better. And it still won’t be perfect, but the only way is forward.”

As part of our interview, Messersmith explained how Oatly leans on its origin story to differentiate itself from the growing number of oat milk brands coming to market and why focusing on the unnecessary has been a valuable part of its business strategy. Messersmith, a former Navy officer and longtime food and beverage executive, also discussed his approach to leadership and how he defines success.

It may sound like an oxymoron, but a growing cohort of healthier alcoholic beverages have been finding a receptive audience in recent years. Often promoted as low-calorie, low-carb, or infused functional benefits, these products are resonating with a growing number of consumers focused on health and wellness.

That’s certainly the case for Boochcraft, a three-year-old hard kombucha brand that has been making waves in its home market of Southern California. In an interview included in this episode, Boochcraft co-founder and CMO Adam Hiner said that while the company originally believed that its consumers would be traditional kombucha drinkers, “we were blown away by the diversity of [people] that we’ve attracted, some of which have never had kombucha.”

“It’s broadened our scope of the way we can talk about the product and the way we can market it.” he said.

As part of our conversation, Hiner discussed the origins of the brand and shared his perspective on the trend of healthier drinking. He also spoke about why Boochcraft is resonating with consumers beyond those that are regular kombucha drinkers, the challenges of forecasting demand for a nascent category, and why he sees the company as competing against itself.",Ep. 162: How This Boozy Booch Got Ahead of a Hot Trend

Since co-founding Vita Coco in 2004, Kirban has guided the brand to domination in the coconut water space. Distributed over four continents, Vita Coco holds a 26 percent share of the global market for coconut water, which is estimated to be worth $2.5 billion, according to market research firm Euromonitor. Success has attracted many suitors over the years — PepsiCo was reportedly in talks to acquire the brand in 2017 — yet Vita Coco has remained independent, a key component of Kirban’s plan to build upon the company’s foundation and develop a beverage platform focused on better-for-you brands.

“My goal over the next couple of years is to have four or five totally unique brands in-house under (Vita Coco parent company) All Market Inc. that play in different sub-segments of this healthier, functional drinks market,” Kirban said. “Coke and Pepsi are really good at certain things, and they’ve done quite a lot of M&A in this functional beverage space, but their share of better-for-you beverages continues decline. It’s not what they’re good at. It’s not what they’re focused on. I believe that opens up this lane for us to just drive right through as we should be the ones who really create the better-for-you beverage company for the next generation.”

Within our wide-ranging interview, Kirban also discussed his leadership style, why he hires based on attitude over skill set and how Vita Coco considers innovation and potential acquisitions. He also explained what motivates him to personally invest in brands, and why living close to his office is key to work-life balance.

Leading with a message of “fat is back, sugar is out,” Love Good Fats launched in Canada in 2017 and has emerged as one of the leading brands in the keto space.
