Schweppes now admits that was “not our brightest moment”.

From the senior brand manager, Mukundi Munzhelele, who came up with the bright idea, to marketing manager, Nerisha Maharajh, who signed off on it, various staffers took it on the chin and lampooned themselves for the mistake in the social media ad.

“The complaints we received were passionate and heartfelt,” Munzhelele says. “It was only fair to them (customers) that the actual people who worked on the campaign not only see the responses, but respond in a manner that was fitting.”

According to Munzhelele, the team wanted to modernise the labels. But a change in colour caused a lot of confusion.

Schweppes changed the colour of its soda water branding on its bottles to grey, which made it look like its tonic water labels. It has now changed the labels – tonic water is yellow, and soda water has a stripe of grey.

“We took some time to look at our packaging with the feedback received from consumers and decided not to simply revert to the previous design,” says Munzhelele.

The response sat well with many consumers who applauded the brand for taking responsibility, such as this one.",Coca-Cola confesses and remedies its Schweppes labelling blunder

Distell, the producer of Nederburg wines and Klipdrift brandies which has no beers in its portfolio, reached a “distribution support” agreement with Poison City Brewing, said the craft brewer’s co-founder, Graeme Bird.

Poison City Brewing started selling a lager containing hemp — a variety of the cannabis sativa plant that is devoid of mind-altering ingredients — in major liquor chains in September. The launch coincided with a Constitutional Court ruling that effectively decriminalised the private use of cannabis in SA.

Bird said a distribution partnership was necessary because demand for the brewer’s Durban Poison Cannabis Lager had “overwhelmingly exceeded capacity”.

The agreement would allow Poison City Brewing to meet demand for the beer through both formal and informal channels.

“Distell, as one of the leading liquor beverages companies in SA, has a powerful route-to-market platform and will step change our consumer and market reach,” Bird said.

In late October, Distell reported that revenue in the first quarter of its 2019 financial year was flat because volumes were slightly lower. Nevertheless, the company’s shares have climbed 11% since the trading update.

Often through partnerships, global beverages companies are dipping their toes into the burgeoning cannabis market, which received a major lift in October when Canada legalised the recreational use of the plant.

The world’s biggest brewer, AB InBev, said in October it was keeping a close eye on the cannabis market. “Recent trends in Canada and in certain US states toward legalisation of recreational marijuana are an important development — not only for us as a beer company but for society as a whole,” the group said.

SAB-AB InBev Africa has delivered a strong vote of confidence in Port Elizabeth’s vibrant manufacturing industry with the launch of a brand new R438-million ($30-million) production line at its Ibhayi Brewery based in the coastal town’s industrial area of Perseverance.

The multi-million rand investment is over and above the Public Interest Commitments (PIC) made by AB-InBev to the South African government at the time of its business combination with SABMiller at the end of 2016.

The PIC involves AB InBev investing R1-billion in South Africa over the next 5 years in the areas of Agriculture, Entrepreneurship and Societal Benefits.

“Fixed investment which leads to confidence is one of the key components needed to drive economic growth in a country. In turn, this helps to create jobs and encourages foreign investment, which is not going to happen if domestic investment does not take place.”

“At the onset of the global business combination between SABMiller and AB InBev the agenda was one of growth and investment. A commitment was made to grow and make a real difference in South Africa and this commitment has been accelerated through the investment at Ibhayi Brewery,” says Ricardo Tadeu, Zone President, SAB and AB InBev Africa.

“It is an important vote of confidence in the beer category and the South African economy at large.”

The new 6000m2 line adds an annual capacity of 500 000 hectolitres to the current approximate 1.8-million hectolitre capacity of Ibhayi Brewery for 2018/2019.

There are now a total of two production lines at the Port Elizabeth based brewery.

The full capability of the new line is to produce an additional 1.8-m bectolitres of beer per year, which would bring Ibhayi Brewery’s annual capacity to close on 3.6-m hectolitres of beer when in full operation.

The new line has created employment for 14 people, mostly women, who operate the line over several shifts. Another 40 people are expected to be employed when the line operates at its full capacity and volumes are increased over the coming years.

Ibhayi Brewery now employs a total of 152 people, operating the two production lines over several shifts.

The new line currently produces SAB’s recently introduced 1-litre Castle Lager and Carling Black Label returnable glass bottles at 34 500 bottles per hour.

It is expected that Castle Lite’s 910ml returnable glass bottle will run on the line from early 2019.

In addition to these brands, Ibhayi Brewery produces Hansa Pilsner, Castle Milk Stout and Lion Lager.

The Ibhayi Brewery warehouse is also being expanded to accommodate the increased volume being produced with the introduction of the new packaging line, adding another 2000m2 to the plant.

“This investment will empower our employees to do what they do best – brewing the best quality beer, innovating and ensuring that we do so in a way that will drive sustainable growth,” says Tadeu.

The construction of the new line at Ibhayi Brewery began in March this year and was completed in seven months. It officially went online and produced its first batch of beer in October.

This is the third expansion investment at its South African breweries in two years.

In mid-2017, SAB invested R2.8-billion in expansions at its Gauteng-based breweries, Alrode in the south of Johannesburg and Rosslyn outside of Pretoria. The expansions included a new packaging line for returnable glass bottles at both breweries and a brewhouse at Rosslyn. Approximately 70 additional full-time jobs were created.

In addition to this investment, a new greenfield malting plant was recently built at Alrode Brewery at a cost of R1.2-billion, expanding malting capacity by 110 0000 tonnes of malt to 150 000 tonnes of malt produced a year.

Previously, SAB would import 60% of its malt requirements and the new plant has decreased this figure to close to 0%. The new maltings plant has seen an additional 28 new jobs created.",SAB invests R438-million in new production line at Port Elizabeth brewery

Coca-Cola SA’s recent public apology for the soda-tonic labelling blunder on its Schweppes range of mixers has been hailed by marketing analysts… BUT, the company now stands accused of a similar gaffe with other brands that could have some dangerous consequences.

Angry consumers have taken the company to task on social media about its new packaging for Coke, Stoney and Sprite where its hard to distinguish the difference between regular and sugar-free variants.

But where the soda-water confusion was just irritating, a mix-up in these other Coca-Cola brands could be deadly for diabetics.

There’s been no public word as yet on this issue from the company.

Meanwhile consumer journalist/bloggist, Megan Power, has some good insights on these two stories here in her “Power Report”….

An interesting thing about the recent Schweppes soda-water ‘apology’ is that nowhere in the actual 1 minute 16-second video posted on social media does the word “sorry” appear. But it doesn’t matter. What Schweppes has successfully done — something many brands find so hard to do — is own up to its blunder publicly and fix it. Customers loved it….

But the Schweppes mea culpa shouldn’t be seen as a clever piece of spin that’s earned the brand and its agency some temporary kudos. It goes further than that. The more a brand successfully navigates the little bumps on the road, the more prepared it is to cope with the big crises when they happen, and the more receptive and understanding its customer base becomes.

Slip-ups, if managed well, present opportunities to strengthen trust, credibility and goodwill with customers, and should be embraced. It’s the regular deposits into the goodwill bank that pay off when something much bigger breaks.

Another win is that when businesses do right by their customers, they set precedent which raises the bar for all future customer engagements. In Schweppes’ case, Coca-Cola (which owns the brand) will now be held to a higher standard across all its brands.

It’s already happening to Coke. As with the soda-tonic fiasco, Coke’s new packaging for regular Coke and its sugar-free variants are just as indistinguishable, and causing much upset. But where the soda-water confusion was just irritating, a mix-up in Coke brands for diabetics could be deadly.

Consumers, who have already taken to social media to protest and warn Coke of dire consequences if diabetics suffer, expect the brand to take stock — and action. Just like it did in the Schweppes situation. Except, this time, they’ll want a bit more urgency.

Companies shouldn’t think they’re able to pick and choose which complaints they’ll entertain, and when. And certainly not a company which has just spent time and money owning up in a very public way to a fairly innocuous issue….

,"January 27, 2019",https://www.drinkstuff-sa.co.za/wp-content/uploads/Distell-Premium-Wine-Co.jpg,https://www.drinkstuff-sa.co.za/distell-launches-premium-wine-company/,"Wine and spirits producer Distell has launched a stand-alone company specifically focused on the premium and super-premium wine category, adding some significant corporate muscle behind SA’s efforts to raise its global wine profile.

The new company, Libertas Vineyards and Estates, will remain wholly owned by Distell and be the custodian of the company’s premium wine brands, including Allesverloren, Nederburg, Plaisir de Merle and Zonnebloem.

The move is just a step in a journey that began in 2017 when, to shock and horror, Distell culled its portfolio of wine brands, selling venerable names like Le Bonheur and Uitkyk and exiting complicated partnerships.

Historically Distell has managed its premium wines as a division within the company, alongside ciders, ready-to-drinks and mainstream wines.

“There is recognition that the category is challenging and inherently complex and requires a specialist focus, different culture and entrepreneurial approach,” says Kay Nash, MD of the new business (left).

“Premium and super premium wines as a category are growing strongly around the world. In the US this category grew by 8% plus last year.”

Distell has established Libertas as a separate commercial and legal entity with the iconic Oude Libertas site designated the new home of premium wine in Stellenbosch.

“We have started the premiumisation journey at all levels in the business from fine wine skills to brands and brand experiences, portfolio structures, ways of working and new collaborations, and global routes to market,” says Nash.

She believes the move out of Distell, and the formation of an independent board of directors comprising industry leaders, will support real focus on the premium and fine wine category while benefiting from the scale that Distell brings in critical parts of the value chain.

Distell’s premium wine brands grew by 11.6% in 2018. In the latest annual report CEO Richard Rushton noted that this “affirms our renewed focus on this segment”.

Wine (premium and mainstream combined) contributed 28% of group revenue in the last financial year.

“Premium wines turned over about R1-billion last year. In the context of group revenues of R24-billion, we are a drop in the ocean,” says Nash.

“This is a good move,” says Chris Logan of Opportune Investments, who has long called for Distell to bring a commercial focus to its premium wine business.

“Distell will be tiny when compared to other luxury players like LMVH which has a market cap 81 times that of Distell. But that does not mean the task is impossible.”

He cites the example of Australian firm Treasury Wine Estates, run by SA-born Michael Clarke, who turned the company into one of the world’s biggest and most profitable wine businesses in just four years.

“Of course Treasury has the benefit of strong government support and duty-free access to the Chinese market, which Distell does not necessarily have. But a narrow focus on premium wines is an important starting point,” he says.

Nash does not necessarily agree that bigger is better. “Being well formed, profitable and considered is a better ambition than just big. Big is less important.”

While Distell’s Rushton noted in the last annual report that the company aimed to triple Distell’s premium wine volumes within the next decade, Nash is loathe to discuss specific targets, saying that actions speak louder than words.

“Everyone is asking me – can you make money in this industry? The business is profitable and a good contributor, but not as profitable as it could be. My job is to improve the margins. We have a five-year view on how we will do this.”

With an entrepreneurial and marketing background, Nash joined Distell a year ago to spearhead the change. She has extensive local and international experience in business and marketing strategy.

The company will tackle the task in phases.

The first priority in the short-term, Nash says, is to critically review the large portfolio.

“We have eight brands and 40 sub-brands operating in 88 markets globally across 22 grape varietals, and spanning 384 SKUs. The cost of this complexity is significant and it hinders our ability to focus and support winning propositions.”

In addition, the company has started to consolidate the secondary production from four sites to a single site at Nederburg to ensure a more efficient supply chain.

“We also understand the critical importance of our farms and partners in making beautiful wines and we want to actively participate in developing solutions and the upskilling of our industry so we can build a sustainably successful premium wine industry.”

Other plans include redefining the Nederburg Auction as platform from which to showcase South Africa’s important fine and rare wine wines locally and globally.",Distell launches premium wine company

The 2019 event, the 17th SAAFFI seminar, will be held on Tuesday, 14th March 2019 at the Bytes Conference Centre in Midrand, Gauteng. SAAFFI is the official body of the local flavour and fragrance industry.

“The full-day program features an impressive line-up of speakers, a hands-on workshop, an inspiring motivational presentation and a networking cocktail event, where various interesting (sometimes dramatic!) tastes and aromas will be showcased, says SAAFFI’s Sharon Bolel.

For the last 17 years, the annual SAAFFI seminar has attracted around 200 key personnel drawn from a wide range of companies both in the flavour & fragrance sector, and from FMCG companies (who are users of flavours and fragrances), as well as academics, consultants, regulators, raw material suppliers and anyone interested in the fascinating world of fragrance and flavours.

The day offers a valuable learning and networking opportunity to people in management, sales, marketing, technical, procurement, R&D, applications, operations and even tertiary level students.

Addressing relevant topics of newsworthy interest, and confronting thorny business issues has always been one of the guiding principles of the organising committee.

The 2019 seminar themed “TABOO or not TABOO – trends that are smoking H(P)ot!” will examine issues of relevance to our industry which were once taboo, and have now opened up – are now allowed, and even trendy!

Of course, we have jumped on the cannabis band-wagon. But there are so many other topics, products and concepts which have moved from the space of being “Taboo” into the space of being accepted and sometimes desirable.

Presentation topics include flavour trends, fragrance trends, the journey towards cannabis beer, food fraud, insect protein, the taboos of the future, taboos in overcoming the “diversity, inclusion, equality” conundrum.

Peak hour traffic concerns can be happily allayed as the Gautrain serves the venue.

“This is an industry event which offers so much for so many. Those who attend are sure to take away added skills, useful information and a solid dose of career-oriented motivation,” adds Bolel.

“A day not to be missed by any flavour and fragrance industry professional… An additional attraction is the jam-packed goody bag which each delegate takes home!”

SAAFFI, the South African Association of the Flavour & Fragrance Industry, represents all aspects of this fascinating industry. It unites the industry across non-competitive issues, freeing up individual organisations to grow their business.

JSE-listed Brimstone is offering to buy 15% of Clover’s shares at R25 each. Other members of the Milco consortium are Ploughshare Investments, which will buy 10.9%, and IncuBev, which will buy 8.3%.

The food group’s share price jumped 19% to R23.80 on Monday morning after the JSE opened.

“CBC is Israel’s leading manufacturer and distributor of beverages and, through its foreign subsidiaries, has manufacturing and distribution operations in Turkey, Romania, and Uzbekistan.

“CBC, which is also the owner of the Tara dairy, Israel’s second-largest milk processing dairy, produces and distributes its own brands and Müller brands, and it operates the licence for the Müller brand in Romania.”

CBC also owns Gat Foods, a “grove to table” juice operation with customers in more than 70 countries. In addition, CBC works closely with its international franchisors, including The Coca-Cola Company, Carlsberg, Anheuser-Busch InBev, the Müller Group and Diageo.

IncuBev is an international business focused on the food and beverage sectors in sub-Saharan Africa.

IncuBev has a network design with access to deep operational, private equity, banking and management consulting expertise, within sub-Saharan Africa and globally.

Ploughshare is a privately owned, independent investment company that is part of a broader international investment group that has investments and expertise in retail, distribution and beverages.

Milco believes that Clover presents a uniquely attractive investment given its expansive chilled distribution capability, strong market position for key brands and an experienced management team.

Milco says, with its extensive knowledge of the dairy, juice and non-alcoholic beverage industries, it has the technical and research ability to bring healthier food to consumers, access to international brands, and connections and operating experience in sub-Saharan businesses, in addition to its proven commercial and trade abilities.

Milco intends to combine its capabilities with those of Clover to unlock value through key strategic initiatives, primarily aimed at accelerating sales, distribution and efficiency opportunities within Clover’s product portfolio in South Africa, with expansion into select sub-Saharan Africa territories.

According to the official media releases, additional acquisitions in SA are planned.

MD Michael Ratcliffe is the third generation family member to oversee this high-quality boutique operation.

From 1771 till 1902, Warwick was known as the farm ‘De Goede Sukses’. After the Anglo Boer war ended in 1902, Colonel William Alexander Gordon, Commanding Officer of the Warwickshire regiment bought the historic farm.

He renamed it ‘Warwick’ as a tribute to his regiment and the rest, as they say, is history.

Stan Ratcliffe purchased Warwick on April 1st, 1964 after an extensive search for the best ‘terroir’ in the Cape. Together with his wife Norma, they soon realised the potential of the extraordinary property and began planting Cabernet Sauvignon.

The Cabernet Sauvignon vines produced high-quality grapes, which were soon in demand from neighbouring wineries. Norma became more and more interested in the making of wine and began to study the subject.

Soon a cellar was in place and Norma began producing her own handcrafted wines using the Warwick grapes.

In 1984 the first Warwick Cabernet Sauvignon called ‘La Femme Bleu’- the Blue Lady – was released.

Norma had a natural talent for making great wines and in 1986 Warwick Trilogy was released, a Bordeaux style blend which has since become a flagship of the South African wine industry.",Stellenbosch’s iconic Warwick Wine Estate sold to US investors

The sales and distribution agreement follows last year’s partnership between the two companies which saw RFG taking over packaging of part of the BOS’s portfolio, undertaken at the Pacmar plant in Wellington that it bought in early 2015.

According to BOS Brands South Africa’s MD, Will Battersby (above left), the sales and distribution agreement with RFG will further enhance synergies across the two companies, creating a significant growth opportunity for both.

“This agreement sees RFG managing all sales and distribution of the BOS range of products in Sub Saharan Africa from March this year,” says Battersby.

“With RFG’s experience in the food and beverage market, its relationships with the total retail sector through its dynamic spectrum of products as well as logistical excellence, BOS is beginning a new chapter in our aim of becoming the leading player in the overall Southern African ice tea market.

“Together with RFG, BOS will now be able to tap into over 10 000 outlets – double of what our current reach allows.”

Some 70% of BOS sales is through the retail sector, with 30% sold through the on-consumption segment including restaurants, coffee-shops and schools.

Since bursting onto the South African scene in 2010, the BOS range of colourfully packaged, refreshing ice teas made from organic rooibos has captured a growing audience and found its way into the hearts and homes of many South Africans.

The healthy, iconically branded range of rooibos ice teas, sports drinks and organic rooibos teas have been supported by fun and quirky marketing campaigns, leading to consumers seeing ice tea and rooibos in a unique new light.

BOS has subsequently become the leading player in South Africa’s premium ice tea market.

Battersby says the South African ice tea market is currently valued at approximately R900m and within this BOS has captured 12% of the retail segment.

“However, we believe that along with the partnership with RFG a long term target of 25% share is achievable,” he says.

“The BOS team will still be responsible for our vibrant brand marketing and communication campaigns, while together with RFG we will continue developing exciting new products, some of which will be launched later this year.”

RFG is one of South Africa’s largest food producers, occupying top brand positions in a number of targeted product categories. Its own brands are complemented by premium private label product ranges, packed for South African and international retailers.

RFG CEO, Bruce Henderson (pic above right), says that since its inception BOS has been a brand admired by RFG.

“We are truly delighted to announce the manufacturing, sales and distribution agreement,” he says. “This partnership with BOS strengthens RFG’s position in the Southern African beverages segment as we now have our own powerful Rhodes juice brand alongside the premium market leader in ice tea.”

The local, home-grown brand has always had big ambitions and the partnering with RFG to increase its footprint in Southern Africa comes at a time when BOS Brands is expanding its drive in the international market place.

After proving early success in the South African market, BOS introduced its range of premium ice teas in Western Europe in 2014, securing listings in major retailers like Albert Heijn, Jumbo and Carrefour and opening offices in Amsterdam and Paris.

Towards the end of last year, the company opened its doors in San Diego, California and 2018 will see BOS launching into the West Coast of the United States – the biggest global ice tea market with annual consumption over 22 litres per capita.

The Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town is calling on all South Africans to put down their drinking straws because we are facing a “catastrawphe”, and something must be done to save our seas.

The aquarium says that hundreds of billions of plastic straws are used globally, damaging ecosystems, killing wildlife and contributing to the pollution of our atmosphere. That’s why all food kiosks inside the Two Oceans Aquarium are now using plastic-free, PLA drinking straws and packaging.

While these look and feel like regular straws, they will break down if disposed of in a correctly functioning compost heap, the Aquarium says.

The aquarium’s decision to axe plastic straws has made other major retailers follow suit, with popular restaurant chain Ocean Basket recently announcing on Twitter that they too would no longer be using straws in their stores.

According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), at current rates of pollution, there will likely be more plastic in the sea than fish by 2050.

In December 2017 South Africa joined the other 193 UN countries and signed a resolution to help eliminate marine litter and microplastics in the sea.

Once in the ocean, plastic can take hundreds of years to degrade, all the while breaking down into smaller and smaller “microplastics” – which can be consumed by marine animals and find their way into the human food chain.

The South African wine industry is experiencing one of its most exciting – and challenging – phases in history. So, what are some of the emerging trends shaping it in 2018?

Overall wine quality has increased dramatically over the last five years, international recognition is at an all-time high and the consumer is now spoilt for choice, with a wealth of new producers, varieties and styles, writes Roland Peens, director of WineCellar.co.za.

Though winery input costs have risen and the continued drought may mean a significant drop in yield, the battered rand has helped exports and aid profitability.

South African wine offers tremendous value locally and abroad, but premium South African wines are surging in price, widening the gap to everyday beverage wines.

Rosé could not be more trendy and the growth of the pemium rosé category continues around the world. It has, however, taken some time in South Africa as we have had to shake off the semi-sweet, poor quality, bright pink image.

Rosé can be a by-product of red winemaking in order to make reds more concentrated. It can also be a blend of left-over red and white wines. The category of premium rosé is, of course, quality focused and when done well, rosé can offer the freshness of fine white and the depth of a light red.

The south of France is famous for its rosé from Bandol and Provence, some of which can age for decades. Serious rosé is gaining popularity in South Africa and more producers are figuring out how to produce and market exciting wines.

The talk of the town is the Jean Roi Cap Provincial Rosé 2016 from L’Ormarins. It’s a blend of various varieties including a large Cinsaut component from the Swartland. Light salmon in colour, there is a lovely depth of florals, citrus, and a savoury and textured finish.

Sauvignon Blanc has been hurdled by Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc as the leading white varieties over the last decade in South Africa.

Usually offering a crisp acidity, tropical flavours as well as green pepper notes, South African Sauvignon Blanc, however, can be rather watery, offering less excitement than other varieties. But, older vines, lower yields and more authentic winemaking can make for serious, long ageing versions.

Bloemendal Suider Terras Sauvignon Blanc 2015 is arguably SA’s best, produced from a 35-year-old heritage block, high up in Durbanville. It is powerful, richly textured and has the structure to age a decade or even two.

2017 is also quickly being regarded as the best vintage of Sauvignon Blanc in the last decade, so expect your favourite “Savie” to have an extra gear this year.

Three years of drought in the Western Cape is going to severely impact yields in 2018 as water quotas are slashed and the vines struggle to keep up production.

This will not only decrease volumes but also push up costs in years to come. Expect entry-level wines to become more expensive as stocks are diminished and the drought continues.

Economically and politically this is a major concern as large volume wineries operate at marginal profitability levels.

As entry-level wines will be affected by the drought, SA’s premium wines will also be affected, but in a different way. Lower yields and smaller berries make for more concentrated and perhaps better quality wines. Farming and production costs will, however, continue to push SA’s premium wines up faster than inflation.

With relatively small volumes of South Africa’s top wines, especially gaining a huge international following, demand will be bigger than supply.

The model of en primeur (wine futures) or buying pre-release, will become more popular for the highly-demanded great vintages.

Buying pre-release not only allows you to secure your purchase early but also speculate on the price if you think it may appreciate on release.

As the quality of the fine 2017 vintage gets realised, expect there to be strong demand to buy 2017 en-primeur already in 2018.

South Africa is still behind in online retail with mature markets like the US or UK buying five times more of all goods online than SA.

As the internet gets faster, transactions more secure and e-commerce more efficient, expect to buy more of your wine online.

It is great to peruse the bottles on a shelf, but expect lower prices online, more information, no lugging of heavy wine boxes, shopping in your nighty and of course, no parking issues…

Predictions for the industry and how South African wine will fair internationally in future

Like many other South African industries, wine will continue to struggle in South Africa on a number of levels. Employing around 250,000 people and contributing to 1-2% of GDP it’s an important industry that is battling profitability, inequality, skills shortages and now drought.

With little government support and competition from a number of countries, we will have to improve our marketing and efficiency in order to keep our foothold in the international market.

South African consumers still have it easy however as supply still exceeds demand. South Africa offers arguably the best value wines in the world and spectacular quality at all price points.

On your next trip to Europe, this should be evident as you try to buy a nice bottle in a restaurant under R300…

Consumers are for the first time open to experimenting with new varieties, styles and flavours. The world is bigger than Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Merlot and there are a lot more exciting wines out there today than 10 years ago.

Another big change is that consumers want to know the backstory behind the wine. Where is it made, how is it made and who are the characters behind the wine.

These questions are similar to the revolution happening in cheese, beer, coffee, meat and many artisanal products in South Africa. It’s an exciting time. We want wine to be authentic, sustainable and delicious.

This is happening on two levels. Well-stored vintage SA wines are reaching new heights in terms of rarity and prices. Meerlust Red 1978 went for an astonishing record price of R16,000 per bottle on the Nederburg Auction this year.

Unfortunately, dodgy bottles stored in your grandfather’s cupboard don’t count.

Secondly, recently released premium wines are appreciating year-on-year at astonishing levels, well above inflation.

Not only are new vintages climbing in price, but fine reds of five to eight years of age are becoming seriously sought-after and therefore more expensive.

For the first time, there are wine investors speculating on new releases. This is good news for the industry, but bad news for collectors hoping to pick up bargain lots.",Five SA wine trends to watch for in 2018

After 200 years of making beer, Newlands Brewery in Cape Town is going into the water business, one of many corporates who will be asked to help with the city’s impending catastrophic Day Zero or municipal water shut-down come April.

Queues at the brewery’s spring, where free water can be collected, have become almost unmanageable as the reality of Day Zero has dawned on Capetonians. Collections are already limited to 25 litres per day.

Now South African Breweries “has indicated its willingness to assist in the bottling and distribution of water drawn from the Newlands spring”, according to a statement on Sunday from Michael Mpofu, spokesman for Western Cape Premier Helen Zille.

He said Zille would attend a meeting at the brewery on Monday to discuss the rollout of the plan.

In a tweet on Sunday, Zille said she would also publish a summary on Monday “of what I know at present about how Day Zero, the run-up and the aftermath, will be managed”. [You can read her very sobering Daily Maverick article here…]

Today, the article above quoted this:

South African Breweries have been the first to step up to the plate. In a discussion this weekend, Mr Ricardo Tadeu, SAB’s Zone President for Africa, and Mr Des Jacobs, SABS Western Cape Regional Director, committed the Newlands brewery to fill 12-million quart bottles with water (instead of beer) from the famous spring (whose water is normally used to brew beer). The SAB network will deliver water to retail outlets in designated areas of greatest need over several weeks. The bottling of water will have to start as soon as possible to ensure sufficient stockpiles. Work is well under way between SAB and the SABS to ensure that the bottled water will meet the required quality standard. Production will begin soon, and the bottles, labelled “Water, Not for Sale”, will be delivered at outlets when Day Zero arrives. Consumers will pay R1 for each “quart” (as South Africans still refer to the large beer bottle) which is about three quarters of a litre, with a maximum limit per person. The R1 is the cost of the bottle’s deposit. The water itself is free. When the bottle is returned, empty, it will be replaced, full, at no charge.

Zille’s intervention comes after Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille admitted on last Thursday – the day before the City of Cape Town voted to relieve her of power to manage the water crisis – that Day Zero is now likely. The projected date is 20 April, though it is likely to be sooner.

Mpofu said Zille’s first meeting of the week, early on today would be with officials from national disaster management, the police, the South African Defence Force and the State Security Agency, among others.

“The focus of the meeting will be preparations for and management of Day Zero [and its aftermath],” said Mpofu.

The City of Cape Town told TimesLive on Friday that its plans for 200 water collection points around the city, where citizens will be able to collect a daily allowance of 25 litres, were still being finalised. It was unable to provide any specific information.

With the impending likelihood of Day Zero in April, Coca-Cola Peninsula Beverages has issued a report on its actions to help augment water supplies to Cape Town, as well as how its mitigating the water crisis on its own operations.

Coca-Cola Peninsula Beverages (CCPB), in partnership with the Coca-Cola Foundation and participating suppliers, is in the process of finalising the details to provide millions of litres of relief water to the Western Cape Province and City of Cape Town.

This forms part of its commitment to helping the City mitigate the impact of Day Zero. This initiative is dependent on CCPB being able to utilise alternate water sources in order to supplement the use of municipal water.

The “prepared water” will be provided in a two-litre recyclable PET bottle, said Priscilla Urquhart, Public Affairs and Communications Manager at CCPB.

The bottles will be clearly marked “not for resale” and would also be produced to supply to emergency sites as determined by the Provincial Task Team on Water and the Disaster Risk Management team.

CCPB will be working closely with the relevant authorities to ensure full approvals of all aspects of this water relief undertaking.

On the existing bottled water products it sells, CCPB has already implemented a discount structure with its retail customers on the BonAqua 1.5 litre [still] water in order to provide this product to consumers at affordable prices.

All non-flavoured Bonaqua and Valpre bottled water sold in the Western Cape is produced and brought in from outside the Western Cape.

“We are deeply concerned by the water crisis facing the city and have implemented many changes and efficiencies across our operations to ensure it is being water efficient,” said Urquhart.

CCPB has invested in a number of initiatives in order to reduce the reliance on municipal water which include the potential use of professionally installed boreholes which are currently being tested in terms of sustainability and impact on the environment.

CCPB is working with the relevant authorities to facilitate the speedy issuing of the necessary licences to ensure that municipal water supplies are protected.

The company has installed a 1.5-million litre bulk water tank at the plant in order to ensure a buffer in supply once the boreholes are approved and operational.

It has also acquired three 33,000-litre food-grade water tankers to transport water from sources outside the water-stressed areas.

CCPB will help hydrate The Argus Cycle Tour

Following an announcement by the Cape Town Cycle Tour Trust this week, CCPB, as one of the main partners of the Cape Town Cycle Tour, will be using these tankers to assist in delivering the 2-million litres of water required by the City to ensure the event is water neutral.

The water is being sourced from areas outside of the Western Cape, that are unaffected by any water shortages, and will be delivered into the City’s local water grid.

“In addition CCPB, has committed R1-m to fund an entrepreneurship initiative in conjunction with the City of Cape Town and Western Cape Government to fund new ideas that will stimulate the ‘water-wise economy’ in the Western Cape,” said Urquhart.

CCPB is working with the Coca-Cola Foundation and other key partners to identify further initiatives in order to militate against the impact of the water crisis and to secure sustainable solutions into the future.",Coca-Cola in Cape Town readies for Day Zero

For Capetonians there is only one topic of conversation: water. The nightmare scenario of Day Zero, when the municipal taps are turned off in April, is ever more likely. SA’s bottled water industry is rising to the crisis, reports SANBWA.

SANBWA – The SA Natural Bottled Water Association – puts out a monthly newsletter, and this is what its CEO, Charlotte Metcalf, reported in her latest missive this week.

“Over the last 10 working days, the SANBWA office has been inundated with requests for (a) donations and (b) comment on issues plaguing the Cape’s collective mind.

“With respect to donations, we’ve suggested that our members work with organisations like Gift of the Givers and Water Shortage SA.

“The former always has well thought-through plans that it implements quietly and effectively to make a real difference where it matters, and the latter because it is planning to supply water to retirement centres and other institutions that will not be able to go and stand in line for their daily quota of water.

“In conjunction with disaster management, WSSA has established that there are 80 registered retirement centres in Cape Town with an average of 100 residents a centre plus another 4000 residents in institutions that might not be registered.

“It therefore needs 60 000l of water a day from day zero till we have enough water to switch the water back on. If you can assist, Greg Pillay is your contact at the City of Cape Town’s Disaster Risk Management Centre on 021 597 5009 or you can visit the website as well as Facebook.

Pienaar & Son, a boutique craft distillery based in Cape Town’s City Bowl, has launched a ‘Drought Edition’ gin with the aim of raising awareness around the water shortage, whilst reducing their own water consumption.

As master distiller, Andre Pienaar, explains: “Gin comes out of the still at 80% alcohol and we usually then add around 200 litres of water, per batch, in order to get the strength of the gin to 43% alcohol.

“We decided to skip this step and bottle the gin at 80% alc as most of our customers drink our gin as a double with tonic. With the Drought Edition, we recommend that it’s served as just a single measure with tonic – it’s the same amount of flavour and same amount of alcohol as a double, just with less water.”

Pienaar & Son will produce a Drought Edition version of their existing gin varietals – EMPIRE and ORIENT.

EMPIRE is a dry English-style gin infused with cucumber, grapefruit, fresh lemon peel and cardamom.

ORIENT is a unique sweet and spicy Eastern inspired gin infused with vanilla, rosemary, orange peel and cinnamon.

When Pienaar established the distillery in 2015, his vision was to create a range of gins that were a departure from the medicinal nature (flavour-wise) many traditional gins possess, and to deliver quality, modern spirits that were an ode to Cape Town’s past and cultural influences.

With the current drought affecting the city, his hope for the introduction of the Drought Edition is to demonstrate that everyone can do something to save water.

“It seemed so pointless when we’re trying everything we can to save water that we’re diluting gin. Over half a bottle of spirits at 43% alcohol is water.

“The water doesn’t add any flavour, it just dilutes the alcohol to a sipping strength, and I imagine only a tiny portion of gin drinkers are enjoying it neat,” says Pienaar.

Pienaar & Son believe in starting traditions, not following them. They also believe in helping to make a difference in the city they call home and with the Drought Edition they hope to have done just that.

“Our industry uses a lot of water and maybe the water we save through this initiative will only make a small dent, but that’s not the point. The point is that no one and no business is exempt from trying to make a difference in this difficult time. No matter how big or how small.”

,"October 9, 2018",https://www.drinkstuff-sa.co.za/wp-content/uploads/Durban-Poison-beer.jpg,https://www.drinkstuff-sa.co.za/sas-first-dagga-beer/,"A Durban craft brewery backed by two prominent CEOs of JSE-listed companies has launched the country’s first beer made with cannabis, aptly named after the city’s well-known dagga variety, Durban Poison.

The brewer has received funding from a number of well-known Durban-based investors, including RCL Foods CEO, Miles Dally, and Spar CEO, Graham O’Connor.

Poison City Brewing started selling a lager containing hemp — a variety of the cannabis sativa plant largely devoid of mind-altering ingredients — in major liquor chains in September, according to the company’s co-owner, Andre Schubert.

The 4% alcohol beer is described by the company as a “light-bodied, easy-drinking beer perfect for hot weather or chilling next to the beach”.

The launch comes shortly after the Constitutional Court effectively decriminalised the private use of cannabis in SA, and as global brewing giants increasingly link up with marijuana producers.

International brewers are selling less beer in territories where cannabis has been legalised, prompting them to seek tie-ups.

A 2017 study by Georgia State University found that alcohol sales had fallen 15% in US states where medicinal marijuana had been legalised.

In August, Constellation Brands, which makes Corona beers in the US, poured another $4bn into Canadian marijuana company, Canopy Growth.

Diageo, which makes Guinness beers and Johnnie Walker whiskey, is reportedly in talks with Canadian marijuana producers about a possible deal, and Molson Coors Brewing Company, through its own joint venture, plans to make cannabis drinks in Canada, which is in the process of legalising the recreational use of marijuana.

“Cannabis beers are becoming a massive worldwide trend … We’re setting a precedent for other breweries in SA by being the first to experiment with this ingredient here,” said Graeme Bird, co-owner and founder of the Durban-based Poison City Brewing.

“Hops and cannabis are very closely related and share many similar chemical characteristics, which means that hemp is an interesting and viable ingredient for beer-making,” Bird said.

Hemp is a type of cannabis that does not contain the psychoactive ingredient which makes a user “high” – tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

As it is not yet legal in SA to grow hemp, Schubert said the beer was made with legally imported strains, mostly from Germany and Eastern Europe.

To import hemp, SA companies need certificates showing that THC levels are below certain thresholds.

Schubert said Poison City Brewing would be keen to add small amounts of THC to certain brews if SA’s laws allowed it.

He was also in favour of local hemp production, as the plant was easy to grow and could create large-scale employment in rural areas, in addition to greater tax revenues and export opportunities.

The department of agriculture, forestry and fisheries said in September it had formally requested the departments of health, justice and constitutional development to consider the necessary legislative changes to allow for the commercialisation of hemp.

The IFP party said in a statement in September that its campaign to legalise hemp cultivation “is starting to bear fruit”.

“The IFP believes … the commercialisation of hemp farming in the country could have vast economic and employment potential, and must therefore be unpacked, studied and piloted by the relevant departments and phased into our economy as soon as possible.”

Hemp fibres can be used to make industrial materials, fabrics and clothing.

SA’s industry is likely to follow suit says SANBWA, the SA National Bottled Water Association.

According to EFBW, over the past five years (2012 – 2017), packaged water grew 5.7%, bulk/HOD water grew by 5%, and flavoured and enhanced waters grew by 6.4% versus carbonated soft drinks which shrank 0.2% and JNSDs which shrank 0.5%.

The growth rates for the next five years (2017 – 2022) are expected to come in at 5.9% for packaged water, 5.4% for bulk/HOD water and 4.9% for flavoured and enhanced waters versus 1.3% for carbonated soft drinks and 2.4% for JNSDs.

The EFBW concluded that, globally, carbonated soft drinks, juices and most other soft drinks – except for energy – are stagnant or in decline. This, as well as the fact that all water categories are growing strongly, is being driven by the health and wellness agenda.

However, it pointed out, much of this growth is outside of Europe. Indeed, much has been written about the growth of the packaged water industries in the United States, India, China and other Asian and middle Eastern countries.

In South Africa, the bottled water industry in South Africa is tiny compared to the total beverage market including alcoholic beverages, just 3.8% in 2016.

Its total size nationally, not just in the Western Cape, for 2016 was 502-million litres. This annual figure is less than the 520-million litres daily target consumption for the City of Cape Town.

According to BMi Research 2016 figures (2017 figures are not yet available), category shares of the non-alcoholic beverage market are:

While bottled water accounts for just 8,9% of the total non-alcoholic beverage sector, according to SANBWA executive director, Charlotte Metcalf, South Africans are drinking more packaged water.

BMi Research figures show that, consumption in 2012 grew by 3.3%, in 2013 by 1.3%, in 2014 by 1.3%, in 2015, by 6.2% and in 2016 by 2.3%.

Similarly, the total packaged water market grew by 4.5% in 2012, 2.7% in 2013, 4.1% in 2014, 8.2% in 2015 and 4.5% in 2016.

“Importantly, this growth has not come at the expense of squandering South Africa’s water reserves,” she asserts.

“This is of major concern to consumers and the hospitality industry during times of drought. Both groups should bear in mind that 90% of bottled water in South Africa is either classified as natural water, water defined by origin, or prepared water.

“Natural waters are obtained directly from a natural or drilled underground source and bottled near the source under hygienic conditions. Approximately 70% of all bottled water in South Africa is natural water.

“‘Water Defined by Origin’ is water from a specific environmental source, such as a spring, without passing a through community water system.

“Approximately 20% of all bottled water in South Africa is ‘Water Defined by Origin’. Both these categories are audited annually to ensure the source is sustainable and renewable

“By contrast, prepared water is bottled from a municipal source and approximately 10% of all bottled water in South Africa is prepared water.”

She says that hospitality establishments should identify their water category purchases as it’s important that these do not exacerbate the drought.

“As an additional precaution, look for the SANBWA seal. The SANBWA seal ensures that the water source is environmentally sustainable,” she adds.

“It also ensures that the water is free of chemical contaminants and microbiological impurities such as E coli and that it has been bottled under hygienic conditions. Finally, it confirms conformance to legislation and international standards and best practice.”",Unpacking size and growth of SA’s bottled water market

The brand was acquired by the Coca-Cola Company a little over two years ago and had been successfully rolled out across Southern Africa.

The launch in Spain is the first to hit big Western Europe markets since The Coca-Cola Company became involved in the brand.

“We knew from the start that we have a very unique beverage in Appletiser, with a strong proposition: 100% fruit juice, full of flavour, and ideal for non-alcoholic drinking occasions,” says Spanish brand manager, Óscar González Ramírez (left).

Coca-Cola sent out over 20,000 presentation kits to the Spanish market as an introduction. As hoped, he says, customers fell for the flavour, and Appletiser is now stocked by over 43,000 customers across the country.

“Our strong belief in the brand proposition – combined with the fact that Appletiser is now produced locally in Spain – helped us get the new glass bottler in Bilbao on board at an early stage, building the close relationship you need for a successful launch,” he adds.

Local markets with natural foods and drinks have grown in popularity in Spain and Coca-Cola made it an objective to be at as many of these as possible, targeting men and women aged 30 and over, offering them the opportunity to try Appletiser. This helped build credibility for the brand and its story.

The brand is just over 50 years old, having started in 1966 on a farm in Elgin Valley, known for its orchards which produce some of the finest fruit in South Africa.

Edmond Lombardi, an apple farmer, had the vision of creating a lightly carbonated refreshing apple beverage and by combining ‘apple’ and ‘appetiser’ – Lombardi trademarked the drink as ‘Appletiser’.

The success of the brand continues to build momentum. In 2017 Appletiser and Peartiser (made from pears) both received the Golden Stars Award for Superior Taste – the only stamp of quality in taste granted by food and drink opinion leaders that are Michelin starred Chefs and Sommeliers.

The brand has also proved popular among young consumers, being named the second coolest beverage brand by the Sunday Times Generation Next Survey for two successive years in 2015 and 2016 in South Africa.

Andrea Shuttleworth, head of marketing for Appletiser, says: “We are proud to see how this local brand has grown – first in its home market – and now in Europe and beyond.

,"July 7, 2018",,https://www.drinkstuff-sa.co.za/putting-new-nescafe-gold-to-a-taste-test/,"A revamped Nescafé Gold coffee has been launched globally and in South Africa. Business Insider SA conducted a blind test to find out which people preferred – and the results were surprising.

One of the country’s most popular instant coffee brands, it is now packaged with a new “brushed champagne gold lid and sleek shape”, according to Nestlé.

This is the corporate statement on the new launch:

“For consumers looking for a full flavoured, aromatic coffee, Nestlé is relaunching Nescafé Gold. The new soluble blend includes micrograins of Arabica coffee ground 10 times finer than ordinary ground coffee. These tiny grains enhance the hidden taste and aroma of the Gold Blend.

“Nescafé Gold has been completely reinvented with a new formulation, packaging and communication. The new range also includes a FairTrade organic version.

“Care and attention has been taken at every step of the process – from the selection of the cherry beans, the roasting, the grinding and the preparation – to ensure a premium coffee experience in every cup.

“Nescafé is the world’s leading and preferred coffee brand. After 80 years touching people’s lives every day, we continue to share our passion and craft for making great coffee.

“The relaunch of Nescafé Gold underlines Nestlé’s commitment to developing the coffee business and our leading brands around the world,” said Carsten Fredholm, Head of Beverage Strategic Business Unit.

Not everyone was feeling the bean’s soul, and reactions on South African social media have been mixed.

With this in mind, Business Insider SA set out to do a blind test of the old and new Nescafé Gold, with a group of 19 participants.

Their aim was to see if they could taste a difference, and whether a clear preference emerged.

Each participant was given two cups of coffee, one labelled A, the other B.

Unaware which cup was which, participants had to taste the two different types and tell us which they preferred based on flavour, smell and body.

All participants tasted a clear difference between the two – but they were divided on what they tasted, reports Business Insider SA.

Half of the participants thought the old version was bitter, sharp, and some though it left behind a bad aftertaste. They said it tasted watered-down and bland.

Yet the old blend also had its supporters, who thought it was softer and smoother.

Some tasters claimed the new recipe was a shock to the system, bitter and sour. But there were more who claimed that the new recipe had a fuller body, was smoother and nicely robust.

Wine lovers around the world have a soft spot for it! The Pinotage market is booming! After decades in the wilderness, Pinotage is emerging as South Africa’s signature red grape….

At 24 million litres a year and counting, it’s one of the South African wine industry’s fairy-tale success stories and the good times seem unlikely to end any time soon.

Of the Top 10 most-planted wine grape varieties in the country, Pinotage is the only red cultivar to have grown in hectares over the past 10 years.

That’s according to the latest statistics published by SA Wine Industry Information & Systems (SAWIS). The industry body reports that the total area under Pinotage vines is now at 6 979 ha, up from 6.5% to 7.4% of the total area under vines, and the sales figures are more impressive.

From around 3-million litres of Pinotage a year at the turn of the century, domestic sales have increased to over 5-million litres, and exports since 2001 have gone from just over 8-million litres a year to close on 19-million litres – contributing an estimated R495-million to the local economy in 2017.

Pinotage sales in South Africa’s two biggest export markets, the UK and Germany, have grown from 3.5m and 0.8m litres in 2001 to over 5m and 5.4m litres respectively, with 2017 sales to China and Russia (2.6m and 1.5m litres) now greater than those to other standout markets including Sweden, the USA, France and Denmark.

Pinotage has been a talking point in the context of Wine SA’s trump cards since the first commercial release of the Pinot Noir /Cinsaut cross under a Lanzerac label in 1961.

However, the improved quality and appeal of the variety has been particularly noteworthy over the past 10 years.

In 2017, for example, Pinotage weighed heavily in favour of Kanonkop cellarmaster, Abrie Beeslaar, being named Winemaker of the Year at the prestigious International Wine & Spirit Competition in London, and not for the first time.

Kanonkop’s iconic Black Label Pinotage 2013 from special grapes grown on the Simonsberg in Stellenbosch was a big success at IWSC 2017.

And a year later, at one of South Africa’s premier wine competitions, the Old Mutual Trophy Wine Show, a batch of the 2017 vintage of Arabella Pinotage from Ashton in the Robertson Wine Valley impressed the judges to the extent that it was lauded as Discovery of the Show.

Incredibly, this best-value gold medallist is/was available from the cellar door at just R50 a bottle.

No doubt the research, marketing and knowledge transfer efforts by the Pinotage Association and its stakeholders are among the key factors in a remarkable decade for Pinotage.

In addition, the financial support of Association sponsor Absa over the past 20 years cannot be understated in considering the growth and positioning of Pinotage as one of the South African wine industry’s calling cards around the globe.",From reviled to revered: halcyon days for SA’s Pinotage
,"June 12, 2018",https://www.drinkstuff-sa.co.za/wp-content/uploads/Twizza-range.jpg,https://www.drinkstuff-sa.co.za/home-grown-soft-drink-brand-takes-on-big-red/,"Starting with five cows and one employee in 1980, Ken Clark has built two successful businesses employing more than 1 000 people; Crickley Dairy and Twizza.

Crickley Dairy is an institution in the Eastern Cape, and while Twizza, a carbonated soft drinks business with a distribution network spanning across South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, Botswana and Mozambique, has found a profitable niche in a market dominated by Coca-Cola.

How did the dairy business start?

My dad was a sheep and cattle farmer in the Dordrecht district, and had a small dairy. I took a liking to the dairy as a youngster.

I went to the army, came back and worked for my dad for a short time. I’m very single-minded and we bumped heads a bit, so I eventually opted to go on my own.

So in 1980, I started with just five cows, and tried to start building a little herd. Within a couple of years, I was the biggest milk producer in the Dordrecht district, and started looking at selling milk into the Transkei.

Somebody else was buying milk from me from time to time, and so that sparked an idea. That’s how Crickley started – in a very small, 80m2 rented building.

At that point we were just trading in raw milk, to be honest.

We grew with time, adding fruit juices to our product offering and moving to bigger facilities, until we eventually took over the property in Queenstown where we are situated now.

In 2002, I started looking into carbonated soft drinks (CSDs). I went to Germany, Poland and Italy, looking at equipment, and put a plan together in 2003. Within five months, we were running a 24/7 operation.

The next October, we put in our second line, which had a bit more capacity. In 2008, we put a further line into Queenstown. This time it was a substantially larger line, producing 36 000 litres an hour, and with that base, we started distributing to niche customers around the country.

Once we had a substantial market in Limpopo, we established a plant in Middelburg. We went to Middelburg in September 2011, purchased a property and were able to start working the ground in March 2012.

We needed to catch the peak summer season (December), which meant it was an extremely tight schedule and it presented us with a host of challenges. We managed to overcome these challenges, and we produced our first bottles off that line in December 2012.

The next year we put in a second line, together with a second injection moulding machine. We opened our third plant in Cape Town in 2015 and now have capacity to produce approximately 4.5m litres a day.

Why did you think you could take on Coca Cola?

A number of us started when Coke was reigning supreme, and we realised there was space for an affordable brand. From day one, we’ve been about affordable quality.

But we don’t stand back for Big Red. We believe we’ve got as good, or better, than what they have, and we’re an affordable brand.

But cracking all the channels in the market is not always easy. So we started with wholesale. Prior to that, Coke basically did all their own distribution. We effectively created a CSD category for wholesalers.

There was a lot of excitement in that space because this category was growing at such a high rate. So we got an incredible amount of support from the wholesalers.

The biggest challenge we have with Coke is the strength of their brand. We can’t deny that, it’s a strong brand. Building our brand is key to us going forward.

We’re looking at all sorts of innovation, marketing, and putting up a really good team to get that right. We plan to continue to grow, and to become the number one local producer in the country.

How do you stay competitive?

When I was only in dairy, I was always of the opinion that the cost of our packaging material was exorbitant.

Part of my trip to Germany was about having a look at PET injection moulding, blow moulding and integrated lines from a filling perspective.

It just made sense that we started to do our own packaging from day one with Twizza.

Within two years, we purchased an injection moulding machine, so we control the value chain from raw material to finished bottle.

There’s a lot to be said for owning the value chain, and I think it’s an integral part of our success. The minute you outsource too much to others, you become their cash cow. Also, it takes a huge amount of risk out of the business.

In my first few years, we got to a point where we couldn’t buy pre-forms (a tube-shaped PET product that is subsequently shaped into a container), because Big Red had just taken up all the capacity, and eventually we could only buy ones that didn’t meet their specifications.

That was a huge risk, and prompted me to look at injection moulding and becoming self-reliant.

Subsequent to that, we started making our own bottles for dairy.

That changed that business – I think we still have a huge competitive advantage because we do that and few others do. Unfortunately there’s a huge capital commitment to start it, but the pay-off is definitely there in the long term.

How have you funded the business?

In my very, very early days in the mid-1980s, I bought my own building and put up a pasteurisation plant, and got some funding from the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC).

What I’ve always had is discipline within the business. Buy an asset and pay it off as quickly as you can, and then use the revenue-generation capability from that asset to pay for further assets.

When we started operating in Middelburg, we built up a little nest egg that we could put down as a significant deposit and we got bank funding for the rest.

So over the years we’ve used bank funding, and up to now we haven’t had to go for an equity partner.

Of course we are open to growing and getting bigger, but at the right time, in the right place and with the right partner.

We run a fleet of about 100 trucks, and manage our distribution in such a way that the route to market to the customer is the cheapest.

In some instances it is cheaper to use a third party, but mostly not.

We pride ourselves on our service. You phone and place an order today, we promise delivery within 48 hours on time and in full, but usually we’ll deliver in under 20.

If you can do that consistently, then your customers don’t need to hoard stock, and that becomes a value-add to them as well.

What is the impact of the sugar tax?

I don’t think the dust has settled just yet as far as that’s concerned. It was quite sudden on the entire industry, and I think we’re going to have to wait to see exactly how the consumer accepts this development.

Most of us have reduced sugar to avoid paying tax – we have, throughout our range, because I think price is that important…..",Home-grown soft drink brand takes on ‘Big Red’

Vinpro, the industry association, says the only way to ensure a sustainable supply of wine is if farmers increase prices they receive for wine.

Vinpro has said the average net farming income was about R45,000 per hectare compared with the R70,000 per hectare required to be financially sustainable.

Wine is one of SA’s largest agricultural exports, with the country’s nearly 100,000ha of vineyards, mostly in the Western Cape, accounting for about 4% of world production.

“After years of financial pressure wine producers need a significant income adjustment of close to 30% to ensure a more viable environment. At the moment they on average earn a meagre 1% return on investment, which does not justify the establishment of vineyards,” said Vinpro MD Rico Basson.

He said many wine-grape farmers were either leaving the industry, uprooting vines for more profitable crops or not replacing vineyards.

The Bureau for Economic Research and the Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy predict that the area under wine grapes will be about 10% smaller at 85,000ha by 2022.

In 2017 the South African wine industry sold 447-million litres of wine in the local market and exported 448-million. This totalled 895-million litres, which represents a 3.5% rise in total sales compared to 2016.

A decrease in the volumes that are available for export can also enable South African exporters to negotiate better prices with international importers, said Basson.

Siobhan Thompson, CEO of Wines of SA, said focus on export markets was twofold.

First, the industry aimed to maintain its traditional markets — the UK, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Canada and Japan — while growing value (rand per litre). Second, the focus was on growing the volume and value of exports to what were considered growth markets, namely the US, China and the rest of Africa.",SA’s wine farmers are feeling the pressure

Speaking at the event, Nielsen East and South Africa MD, Bryan Sun, focused on the key drivers that will shape consumer opportunities until 2025, which included the fact that the total South African population will increase by 6%, just over 3-million people – albeit it at a slower pace than the global rate of 12.5%.

This will be compounded by significant changes in labour force composition, with more than 4.3 million women entering the workforce by 2025.

He revealed; “The really interesting aspect is that within local demographic age groups, Generation X (35-49) growth will outpace Generation Y (26-34) growth (Millennials). So, although Y will still be marginally bigger in size than X, older generations will grow faster than younger generations resulting in different product and service needs and a keen focus on health and wellness amongst others.”

Another key driver concerned the fact that 69% of South Africa’s population will be urbanised by 2025 as compared to the current 60%, resulting in cities and urban areas becoming increasingly crowded and some lacking the equivalent development in vital infrastructure to support the influx of people into cities.

“In a more urbanised world, space and time will be at a premium. Living areas will be smaller and storage areas and cupboard space available for product storage will become more limited with consumers requiring ease and efficient offerings to blend with their ‘on-the-go’ lifestyles.

“These types of dynamics create challenges that need to be solved and currently, demand for improved solutions is greater than supply as consumers’ aspirations emerge,” said Sun.

Nielsen innovation director, Esti Prinsloo, reported that the allocation of consumer spend in the South African market has remained relatively the same over the last 15 years, with absolute spend having grown ahead of inflation to the point where the total consumer goods basket is currently valued at R350-billion pa.

Looking at the global picture, Prinsloo said that brand growth is becoming much harder to find, which is borne out by the sombre 0% growth amongst the global Top 20 manufacturers, while the Top 200 manufacturers have only achieved 2.4% growth in the last 12-months.

There are also more categories, brands and products than ever before but the big question is whether they’re actually fulfilling consumer needs?

Prinsloo cited the example of a local retailer that introduced a whopping 11,000 new product items in 2017 alone, with an average individual store having 1,400 product lines more than they did five years ago.

“The average number of brands per basket has dropped from 116 in 2014 to 111 in 2018, with two-thirds of the top 20 brands shopped less often and the average number of store trips down from an average of 71 to 60 a year,” she reported.

“Looking at the drivers shaping this behaviour there are many factors influencing these consumption trends, but to remain truly relevant requires brands to find a winning combination being convenient and making consumers lifestyles easier while also promoting healthy living via natural ingredients.”

During his presentation, Nielsen Retail vertical lead, Gareth Paterson, reported that South Africa has added 100,000 new traditional trade (eg Spaza) and modern trade (hypermarkets, supermarkets) stores to its retail universe over the past 20 years.

“The landscape is shifting, not only between modern and traditional channels but also from big to small, offline to online and between specialist channels such as convenience, specialist, pop up and niche outlets.”

He elaborated that the South African traditional trade environment remains all about true convenience. “Today, traditional trade formats are highly flexible, adaptable, agile store types, attracting more commuters due to their close proximity to travel hubs allowing for ‘on-the-go’ shopping.

“What this means is that gone are the days when you could manage your distribution into all, or at least most, of the modern trade outlets or when traditional trade was limited to rural areas and its products were for lower-income consumers or only consisted of confectionery and beverages.”

Looking at the modern trade format, namely hypermarkets and supermarkets, Paterson described it as a highly competitive space. That said, these types of stores have the advantage of larger floor areas and the resultant ability to capitalise and enhance those spaces.

This is in line with the Nielsen’s Global Retail Growth Strategies Survey findings that consumers are looking for proximity and speed, with 71% looking for convenient locations to shop and 61% preferring to get ‘in and out quickly’.

“In addition, they’re seeking ease and efficiency when shopping with 60% wanting an organised store layout and 53% opting for stores with fast checkouts and short queues. Unsurprisingly then, 76% are willing to use a handheld device when checking out and 78% willing to engage in a self-service checkout,” added Paterson.

Last but certainly not least, Paterson reported that e-commerce retailing outpaces all other channel growth, albeit off of a lower base.

“Given that consumers are now all about convenience, connection, and control this format is perfectly aligned with a new generation of shoppers who are more informed and demanding and is all about ease and time saver.”

He stressed, however, that it was still essential for retailers to follow an inter-connected ‘clicks and bricks’ strategy as South African consumers are not going to shift to online overnight.

“The lines are blurring between manufacturer and retailer, with the growth of direct to consumer. This integration is also taking place between physical and digital with technology penetrating the shopping experience and media and commerce, with channels for shopping and entertainment merging.

“There are thus many more variables at play in today’s retail landscape and many more opportunities to win or lose with consumers who are swiftly adopting new shopping behaviours and demanding better, faster, more personalised retail and product experiences.”",Nielsen unpacks major shifts in SA’s consumer landscape

,"December 20, 2018",https://www.drinkstuff-sa.co.za/wp-content/uploads/Rooibos-rosy-future.jpg,https://www.drinkstuff-sa.co.za/rosy-outlook-for-rooibos/,"The world is counting on agriculture to produce more nutritious food, and SA’s iconic Rooibos tea fits the mould, according to Nicie Vorster, spokesperson for the SA Rooibos Council (SARC).

Rooibos is only grown in South Africa, mainly farmed in the Cederberg and Sandveld areas of the Western Cape.

“Major Rooibos markets view the tea as a premium healthy lifestyle product and promote it in its pure and unblended form, which health-conscious consumers want more of.

“The increased emphasis on health and well-being globally is fuelling a revival and preference for experiences and products that promote wellness,” Vorster says.

“These days, consumers are placing far more value on health, such as using devices and apps to encourage exercise, consuming organic and natural foods, taking health supplements, etc more than ever before, and it’s a trend that will continue well into the future.”

Vorster added that Rooibos is also very versatile. Apart from being a beverage, Rooibos is used in articles ranging from beauty products and nutraceuticals to alcoholic drinks, confectionery and everyday foodstuffs, such as yoghurt and cereal.

“Every year, we are seeing new and exciting innovations in the Rooibos category as entrepreneurs and branders experiment with the product,” Vorster adds.

The current area planted under Rooibos is at a record high of 57 000ha – almost double that of a decade ago as more farmers, especially those in the Swartland region, have cleared existing farmland to make way for Rooibos.

According to Vorster, the sector is also attracting more growers, especially grain farmers who are looking to diversify, since Rooibos is a hardy, dry land crop which is generally less affected by drought when compared to other rain dependent crops.

Vorster says Rooibos farmers took various steps to proactively manage supply in the face of the severe drought that plagued the Western Cape over the past few years, by implementing more sustainable farming practices, removing water-thirsty alien invasive plants in the vicinity of fields and limiting pest and disease outbreaks.

“Even though Rooibos farmers are accustomed to periods of drought, since the region is considered a semi-desert, harvests are not immune to the effects of climate change. Yet, based purely on the average rainfall for the past year, we should see an improvement in crop size in 2019,” says Vorster.

Some more good news includes government’s recent approval to raise the Clanwilliam Dam wall by 13 meters. The move will treble the dam’s storage capacity and provide farmers in the area with a more secure water supply. Construction on the project commenced last month and should take about five years to complete.

The Rooibos industry currently employs an estimated 8 000 farmworkers and additional employment is created in upstream activities, such as processing, packaging and retailing.

About half (between 6 000 and 7 000 tonnes) of Rooibos is consumed locally, while the balance is exported to more than 30 countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, the UK and US.",Rosy outlook for Rooibos

South Africa is a unique country and requires local growth strategies, however, global growth trends are also evident here.

Liquor is growing ahead of CPG, driven by white spirits and beer.

Millennials are the second largest generation cohort in Sub Saharan Africa. According to IRI’s latest shopper survey, 63% of all South African millennials use their smartphones to research product and store information.

This, coupled with the increased ease of access to social media platforms, manufacturers and retailers can expect continued alignment with global trends.

A key growth driver for white spirits and craft beer is through flavour exploration and providing healthier product options. Shoppers are switching from whisky to gin and vodka, which have offered exciting innovation.

With the number of available products increasing for consumers and the popularity of sharing occasions, expect further growth from brands that empower their consumers through social media and innovate to meet their needs.

Craft beer product range growth might be plateauing, however the volume sales are not.

These new products are meeting the expectations of their target consumers, as well as reaching new ones, and are not showing any signs of slowing.

The innovation across white spirits and beer is encouraging premiumisation and providing strong growth for these categories.

Whisky has an opportunity to position itself amongst this flavour explosion through whisky cocktails and various mixers to capture a wider audience.

Consumers want less of it, and governments want to tax what’s left – and this is a huge challenge for F&B manufacturers. FOOD-DRINKStuff SA editor, Brenda Neall, explores sugar reduction and Doehler’s options with its South African GM, Kieran Quinn.

BN: Big question first: what’s driving sugar reduction in SA: health or taxes?

KQ: Naturalness, growing health consciousness and the reduction of sugar and calories continue to be the key drivers in the food and beverage industry.

Of course, the imposition of the sugar tax this year has been a driving issue.

So, SA is slowly but surely following the international trend to cut sugar and calories?

Absolutely… For instance, Doehler’s market research has found that around 3,800 new soft drinks labelled as reduced-sugar and reduced-calorie beverages were introduced onto the global market in 2016 alone. Two years on, the impetus is even stronger.

How complex and/or compromising is filling the sugar void?

Products with reduced sugar and calories are a big trend, but consumers are not happy to compromise on taste, and never will be. The challenge, obviously, is to develop reduced-sugar foods and beverages that have a similar taste profile to a full-sugar variant.

Beside the sweetening effect sugar fulfills multiple functions in food and beverages. It enhances also the taste of the flavour and provides a pleasant mouthfeel. But replacing sugar satisfactorily, from both organoleptic and cost perspectives, is not necessarily that complex or compromising – it’s more about finding the right solution for every type of product application and its positioning.

Let’s talk about what Doehler can offer in sugar reduction?

We deliver application-specific sweetening solutions for every degree of sugar reduction – with the optimal multi-sensory experience always taking centre stage.

We offer tailor-made sweetening solutions that reduce sugar and achieve great results in terms of sweetness perceptions, taste, mouthfeel and stability.

Our line-up includes all the conventional high-intensity sweeteners such as acesulfame and stevia, and then we have a smart range of natural flavour solutions, called MultiSense Flavours that enable the sensory properties of calorie-reduced products to be improved.

Depending on the flavour, the natural MultiSense Flavours range allows the sugar content to be reduced without using additional sweeteners to mask the after-taste of sweeteners or to improve the mouthfeel of sugar-reduced products.

But that’s not all….we also have crystal sugar substitutes such as fruit and malt extracts.

So, this sounds like putting a tapestry of taste together, combining and tweaking, to suit individual products?

Exactly! So, for instance, you can use MultiSense Sweet, a range of natural aromas that improve the sweetness profile and mouthfeel in reduced-sugar beverages and confectionery by optimising the product’s initial and main sweetness.

And there’s also MultiSense Mouthfeel that influences the way the product is perceived by the mouth, producing a sugar-like mouthfeel and avoiding the watery taste many reduced-sugar beverages leave in the mouth.

Another component is MultiSense Masking that’s used to mask the aftertaste and off-notes of sweeteners, and the result is a naturally sweet taste experience.

All of these can be combined with sweeteners or used as a stand-alone solution.

This allows the creation of a well-balanced taste profile, for example, in sugar-reduced CSDs and still drinks, in dairy products such as yoghurt and milk mixes, as well as alcohol-free beers.

It’s a very impressive product range that provides a great taste experience – and a clean label, to boot.

It’s rather a cliché to say that taste is always king, and if it’s not then the product is likely to be a dud – and in my experience, a great many sugar-reduced products are pretty lousy; those made with stevia come to mind…

Agreed… Stevia, the sweetener of natural origin, has been on everyone’s lips for years now. But stevia was mistaken for a fully-fledged sugar substitute in many cases. That’s been a big misunderstanding.

Experience has shown that the best sensory results are achieved by replacing 30-50 % of the sugar. On the other hand, this can differ from application to application as the after-taste takes shape in very different ways in each beverage and food.

The stevia after-taste is usually more apparent in near-water beverages, whereas in tea-based beverages the taste of stevia blends superbly with the herb and tea notes.

At Doehler we customise our MultiSweet Stevia to individually suit each customer’s recipe – and then, combined with MultiSense aromas, we get outstanding results.

Furthermore, to highlight the natural character of the beverage, MultiSweet Stevia can also be combined with agave nectar or MultiSweet Fruit which is made from pure fruit concentrates.

While juices enjoy a health halo of authenticity and natural origin, many of them are actually very calorific due to their high fructose content. But in terms of sugar reduction, it’s particularly important to maintain these positive properties.

Doehler has developed different approaches to reduce the sugar content in fruit juices and fruit-based drinks. The most natural way to reduce sugar is to use raw materials that contain little sugar per se.

We offer a variety of low-Brix juice concentrates and juices, which are obtained from fruits that contain less fruit sugar.

In addition to that, Doehler has developed non-alcoholic fermented juices. By using state-of-the-art fermentation and biotechnologies, Doehler reduces the fructose and calorie content of juices by up to 60 percent.

And last but not least, vegetable juices are the hottest tip to reduce the sugar content in juices and juice based drinks.

Now that sounds dead on-trend! Everyone wants to eat more veggies, but sometimes that’s not so easy to achieve…

Compared to fruit juices they contain less sugar – so, indeed, a juice format offers a convenient, time-saving yet pleasant-tasting solution to adding a dollop of health of products.

We have a broad portfolio of vegetable ingredients that can be tailored to produce wonderful combinations when mixed with fruit juices.

Doehler sets great store on vertical integration – meaning the company has its own sustainable cultivation and vegetable processing facilities using the latest technologies to produce top-class vegetable ingredients.

In principle, these solutions are just the beginning. Sugar reduction is a huge construct, going beyond the provision of sweetening solutions.

Doehler firmly believes that it is a global issue that’s currently turning the entire world of food and beverage upside down. Sugar reduction, as well as naturalness, is one of our corporate topics, which runs like a red thread through the entire value chain.

It’s about securing raw materials that are characterised by an ideal sugar ratio, developing food and beverage concepts that fit the needs of consumers, and ultimately designing recipes that taste outstanding despite their reduced sugar content.

Sprite, the third most popular soft drink in SA (after Coca-Cola and Fanta), has launched a new flavour: cucumber.

Sprite Lemon-Lime Cucumber was first launched in Russia, where cucumber water and cucumber lemonade are popular, last year.

“We were inspired by our colleagues in Russia and so tested Sprite Cucumber with our South African consumers,” Mukundi Munzhelele, senior brand manager of Sprite in South Africa, told Business Insider South Africa.

“They confirmed our belief that this would be an exciting product to launch in South Africa.”

Business Insider South Africa tried it in their offices, and the first surprise was how strong the smell was – a glass of the stuff carried a strong whiff of fresh cucumber.

But while the smell was surprisingly authentic, their tasters were divided.

For some, the cucumber added an interesting twist to the Sprite, a much-welcome new taste to a beverage which they believe has grown boring over the years. (The original Sprite has been around since 1961.)

None of the tasters were turned off by the cucumber flavour, which is relatively strong – but a number immediately commented on an artificial sweetener taste.

In line with the introduction of the sugar tax in April this year, Coca-Cola has started to reduce the sugar content of its drinks and the new cucumber-flavoured Sprite contains both sugar and non-nutritive sweeteners: acesulfame-K and aspartame.

A 250ml glass of cucumber-flavoured contains 135 kilojoules – equal to more than two cups of actual raw cucumber.

So far, a sugar-free cucumber-flavoured Sprite hasn’t been released in South Africa.

Most tasters who didn’t know what the new flavour was thought it was watermelon.

There are many different Sprite flavours across the world. These include cranberry, cherry and tropical.

Recently, Sprite Fiber+ was launched in China – which contains 30% of daily fibre requirement.

Whether these might ever hit local shelves, Coca-Cola South Africa’s Munzhelele said that “driving innovation is an important business priority”.

“Whilst we can’t confirm anything at the moment, we are continually reviewing what we can bring to refresh consumers in South Africa.”

The SA Treasury has generated more money than it anticipated from its new tax on sugary drinks, despite moves by some manufacturers to reformulate products to reduce their sugar content.

The Treasury said it had collected a little more than R1bn in revenue from the sugar tax between April 1 and the end of August, slightly ahead of its projections.

It had anticipated collecting R1.64bn during the entire 2018-2019 fiscal year, which ends on March 31.

The government introduced a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages on April 1, as part of its efforts to combat obesity and its related health risks.

The Treasury calls it the health promotion levy, and it has been set at 2.1c for every gram of sugar per 100ml above a 4g threshold: in other words, the first 4g of sugar per 100ml are exempt from the levy.

The Treasury’s chief director for economics and tax analysis, Christopher Axelson, said there could be several explanations for the higher-than-expected revenue.

“Either the surveys we used to make the calculations underestimated the consumption of sugary beverages, or producers have not reformulated as much as we thought, or consumers have not decreased their consumption of sugary beverages as much as we estimated,” he said.

The Healthy Living Alliance’s executive director, Sibongile Nkosi, said researchers at Wits were currently evaluating the levy.

“We are seeing a lot of re-formulation and new sizes, but we are not sure if industry is absorbing the tax or putting up prices,” she said.

The Beverage Association of SA (BevSA), said it was too soon to gauge the effect of the levy and that it planned to commission a study to determine its effects.

“BevSA has also run an education campaign to encourage healthy consumption of beverages, proper nutrition and exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle with the aim of reducing obesity and noncommunicable diseases in SA,” said BevSA’s GM for corporate services, Mpho Thothela.",Sweet surprise for Treasury as sugar tax puts more than expected in the pot

After several fits and starts, are US consumers finally ready to fully embrace ready-to-drink rooibos tea? That’s the question facing South African tea brand BOS as it rolls out its line of iced rooibos teas in the States, which began last month when it launched at Sprouts locations nationwide.

The company, founded in 2011 in Cape Town, has established a presence in its home market and some European countries, but has particularly ambitious plans for the US.

Speaking with BevNET, CEO and co-founder, Dave Evans, said he expects, if things go according to plan, that America will represent 50 percent of the company’s total business within the next three years.

In bringing a RTD rooibos product to the States, BOS is hoping to develop a category which has struggled to find meaningful traction domestically.

Over the last decade, brands such as Honest Tea, Kalahari, Bhakti, ZT, Wicked Lekker, the kid-focused Bossi, and others have marketed products with rooibos as either the main ingredient or part of a tea blend with varying degrees of success.

What BOS brings to the States is a track record of success in South Africa, where the tea — usually served hot — is a staple of the national diet. Since creating the brand in 2011, founders, Grant Rushmere, a beverage entrepreneur who sold his previous company, Afro Cafe, to Red Bull in 2007, and Richard Bowsher have captured 12 percent of the RTD iced tea market in the country, divided between conventional retail and on-premise sales.

Over the last three years, as its product portfolio has grown to include loose-leaf rooibos tea, tea bags, a sports drink and multi-serve formats, BOS has expanded outside of its home territory with successful launches in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden and Spain.

It has also earned the support of investors, including venture capital fund Invenfin and former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.

Its ability to build an audience for the product is thanks in part to a playful attitude towards marketing, which includes everything from bike-based brand ambassadors to more ambitious tech plays, such as a tweet activated vending machine and an augmented reality smartphone app (think Pokémon GO, but for planting virtual trees).

Outside of the national launch at Sprouts, a specialty retailer of natural and organic food, BOS plans to focus initially on building a presence in Southern California, where it is currently in between 500 and 600 locations.

In determining where to stage the brand’s US launch, Evans noted that Southern California “ticked a lot of boxes in terms of a cultural fit” with South Africa, thanks to mutual interest in warm weather, surfing and consumer demand for healthy lifestyle products.

“It’s a great market for us because consumers are interested in trying innovative new products, and, in terms of our brand positioning, we are all about healthy fun lifestyle, which matches really well with character of Southern California,” said Evans, who joined the company in 2011 and is also an investor.

“All around it’s a great place to build awareness, encourage trial and get traffic.”

For its initial US launch, BOS will be available in five flavours — Lemon, Lime & Ginger, Yuzu, Peach and Berry — with sugar-free SKUs set for introduction later this year, followed by multi-serve bottles in late 2019. The 12 oz cans have a suggested retail price of $1.99 each.

Evans said he believes the combination of taste, health benefits and marketing will help BOS succeed where other rooibos-centric brands have stumbled in the past.

He noted that, because rooibos is naturally caffeine-free and rich in antioxidants, the product is appealing to kids and adults.

“We are renowned for bright colorful iconic cans with the strong iconography, and really bringing a lot of fun and great energy to the packaging,” he said. “People want healthy products but they also want fun and energy.”

For its US production, Evans said that BOS ships its organic rooibos tea and flavours to a co-packer in Arizona.

Congratulations are due South Africa’s Bain’s Cape Mountain Whisky – and Andy Watts – for winning two major awards at the prestigious World Whiskies Awards in London!

At a gala dinner at the Waldorf Hilton Hotel on 22 March 2018, Bain’s was awarded 2018 World’s Best Grain Whisky… and the company’s Founder Distiller, Andy Watts (below), was named the 2018 Global Icons of Whisky Master Distiller/Blender.

Watts – who’s not new to awards (he won World’s Best Grain Whisky in 2013, amongst several other gold awards around the world) – said this event was the most humbling experience of his 34-year career in the whisky industry. (As someone joked on Andy’s Facebook page – “Give that man a… Bain’s!”)

Distell operates Africa’s only commercial whisky distilleries, and proudly makes Bain’s whisky from 100% South African-grown maize.

The awards are quite an accomplishment for South Africa, in a market that is dominated by Ireland (where whisky originated), Scotland, North America, Canada, Japan and India.

Forbes reported that Watts also said: “Our industry in SA is only 40 years old and although we’ve had many hurdles along the way, we have become innovative in our approach to manage our unique warmer climate, found creative ways to use home-grown raw material to our best advantage and constantly strive for crafting exceptional whiskies.”

“Let’s raise our glasses to a double win in London!” said Bain’s on Facebook. “These accolades further inspire us to continue to craft an exceptional South African whisky.”

Other winners of the 2018 Awards included World’s Best Single Malt – Hakushu 25 Year-Old; World’s Best Single Cask Single Malt – Sullivan’s Cove American Oak Single Cask; and World’s Best Blended – Johnnie Walker Gold Reserve.",South African whisky and its distiller named world’s best

This is according to research by Dr Carla Weightman that focuses on the perceptions of local consumers towards wine.

Weightman received her PhD (Wine Biotechnology) in the Faculty of AgriScience at Stellenbosch University on this subject on 20 March 2018.

The project was done in the research programme of Dr Hélène Nieuwoudt, senior researcher at the Institute for Wine Biotechnology, which focuses on consumer and sensory aspects of South African wine.

Weightman’s study is the first of its kind to focus on understanding the changed landscape of local wine consumers in a cross-cultural way:
• In the past, the local wine industry has mostly focused on the export market. However, it has identified growing the domestic market as a priority.
• South Africa has a very low per capita wine consumption when compared to other wine-producing nations.
• The local wine market has also changed over the last two decades and faces stiff competition from other alcoholic beverages, mainly beer.
• The wine industry is now aiming to become more consumer-driven to increase wine consumption.

Weightman’s study focuses on the two most significant wine-consuming population groups in the country, namely urban black and white wine drinkers.

Historically, the white consumer group was the largest group of wine drinkers, but black consumers now account for approximately 80% of the wine consumers in the country. Yet little research has gone into investigating the changing nature of local wine consumers and their perceptions of wine.

It appears wine is associated with status and sophistication, appearance, celebration, relaxation, and food.

Weightman explains: “The fact that wine is consumed with food is what seems to be the driving force differentiating wine from other alcoholic beverage categories. While not surprising, these results emphasise the importance of consumers’ motivations, and the industry should focus its attention on these ideas.

“As consumers’ socio-demographics become similar, so do their wine perceptions and preferences.”

Weightman used focus groups to get a better understanding of consumers’ perceptions, style preferences, the context of enjoyment, buying and consumption patterns, and journeys towards wine consumption.

She developed a questionnaire to investigate motivations for wine consumption on a larger scale and focused on urban consumers living in Gauteng.

Weightman also compared consumers’, trained assessors’ and industry professionals’ sensory perceptions of wine and looked at the influence of cultivar name on consumer liking.

Overall, motivations for drinking wine between the different consumer segments studied were similar. The social aspects, sensory appeal and ethical concern factors were the three most important motivational determinants for consumers’ wine choices.

“Observed differences mainly occurred between male and female consumers. With regards to ethnicity, this study did not reflect a large distinction between the different ethnic groups,” Weightman remarks.

In South Africa, approximately 56% of the wine-drinking population is female, and they seem to drink more wine on a broader set of occasions than their male counterparts, who make up only around 43% of the wine-consuming population.

Wine is usually the first choice alcoholic beverage for females on most occasions. Males will generally choose to drink beer or whisky first but will drink wine when it accompanies a meal.

Females from both cultural groups tended to start consuming wine on a more regular basis earlier in life than their male counterparts. Younger males of both cultural groups drink mostly beer and spirits (whisky).

The most significant influence on wine consumption is the context in which it is consumed. The second key factor is the venue where the consumption will take place, and the third factor is whether a meal is involved.

Ultimately, the deciding factor in consumer choices about wine is related to their budget, according to the study.

Another context where wine consumption differs is at home. Female participants mentioned that they often have a glass of wine when they get home to help them relax after a stressful day. For males, wine consumption was strongly linked to social occasions.

This finding is not limited to wine but has also been found to be true for beer consumption.

An emerging trend amongst black consumers, both male and female, is the idea of matching your meal and your wine to enhance the eating experience.

According to the study, it seems that black consumers are more conscious and interested in keeping up with current trends and brands than their white counterparts.

Interestingly, red wine is considered to be superior to white wine. People are also willing to spend more money on red wine than white wine, and especially if the bottle has a cork.

Consumers also believe wine with a cork ‘tastes different’ to wine with a twist cap but could not describe exactly how the taste differed.

Although the black consumer group had a relatively delayed start to their wine consumption, their motivations for drinking wine and perceptions about it do not seem to differ significantly from that of their white counterparts.

‘Barriers’ in terms of consumption etiquette and unspoken rules were identified as possible reasons preventing broader wine consumption. To some degree, it is also these barriers that differentiate wine from other alcohol categories.

Weightman explains: “This is a bit of a catch-22 when it comes to increasing wine consumption in South Africa. Although the industry would like to see an increase in consumption and make wine more accessible, the elite status of the product is what makes wine appealing.

“This leads to the question: if everyone starts drinking wine, could it lose its appeal?”

The study contributes towards a better understanding of local consumers’ perceptions of wine and also highlights directions for future studies.

There are a few spin-off projects currently being done by the Institute for Wine Biotechnology, targeting specific segments of the local wine consumer population.

The project was funded by the National Research Foundation, Department of Science and Technology, Winetech and the Institute for Wine Biotechnology.",Study sheds light on SA consumers’ attitudes towards wine

This trend has benefitted wine and spirits group Distell, which sold 21% more gin in the first half of its financial year.

Brandy sales also did well, with volume growth of 14%.

Distell says domestic market revenue increased by 8.2% in the six months to December and sales volumes rose by 2.9%, despite a suppressed consumer environment and sustained competitor activity.

Its spirits and ready-to-drink portfolios delivered strong revenue and volume growth while the wine portfolio grew revenue 4.5% due as consumers traded up to its premium wine from mainstream brands.

Mainstream wine growth was muted by increased competition and a “trading up” trend, said Distell CEO, Richard Rushton. He said Distell’s premium wines — including Nederburg, Durbanville Hills and Fleur du Cap — showed strong growth.

Rushton reported that Distell’s premium RTD (ready-to-drink) range of beverages continued to perform well with grape-based brand Bernini managing a 41% volume gain and a 55% surge in value.

On global markets, Rushton said that liqueur Amarula was growing in its top five markets, and in addition there was market share growth in 17 international markets for South African bottled export wines.

Outside of South Africa, the inclusion of KWA Holdings East Africa in Kenya to its Rest-of-Africa business contributed to revenue growth of 18.5% as sales volumes rose 6.6%. It says focus markets on the continent including Namibia, Botswana, Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe all recorded strong growth, but trading conditions were challenging in Mozambique and Nigeria.

International markets outside of Africa grew volumes by 6.7% and revenue by 9.4% as increased local investment in the UK was impacted by the effects of a stronger rand and a less favourable sales mix. Travel Retail grew sales by 43.2%.

Total revenue for the period rose 9.3% to R13.4-billion and operating profit jumped 15% to R1.8-billion.

Normalised operating profit increased by 6.5% and was up 4.4% excluding pro forma foreign currency translation movements. Headline earnings, including its discontinued operations, fell by 5.1% to R1.1 billion and headline earnings per share on the same basis were down 5.1% at 509.2c.

The group was negatively affected by one-off losses and impairments of R85.9-million following a sachet ban and excise duty dispute which impacted the performance of Tanzania Distilleries Limited, in which it holds a 35% interest.

Owner of the Frisco coffee brand, AVI, has reported “aggressive competitor activity” in the South Africa’s instant coffee market.

The company released its results for the six months to end-December earlier this week, reporting that revenue and operating profit from its coffee brands were lower than the first half of last year.

The increased competition has forced AVI to cut instant coffee prices. A 750g tin of Frisco at Makro (as part of a bulk deal) can now be purchased for R67.33 – compared to R70 a year ago.

AVI is up against the brands of the Swiss giant, Nestlé, which in 2016 estimated that its Ricoffy represents one in every two cups of instant coffee consumed in South Africa.

Prices of Ricoffy range from a current offer of R59.99 for 750g at Game to R79 at Makro.

Nestlé also owns Nescafé Gold (currently at R96 for 200g at Makro – unchanged from a year ago.)

Nestlé recently invested R1.2-billion to expand its instant coffee manufacturing plant in Estcourt, KZN. The company has also invested in chicory farming in KZN and the Eastern Cape.

It clearly believes there is money to be made in the SA coffee market. South Africans consume, on average, between 250 and 300 cups of coffee per year – compared to 456 cups in Brazil, and upwards from 500 in Europe.

Coffee drinking in SA has gained ground at the cost of black tea, which has declined in recent years, a survey by the marketing company, Insight Survey, has found.

Through its Ciro brand, AVI is the sole distributor of the European coffee brands, Douwe Egberts and Jacobs, in South Africa.

Jacobs Douwe Egberts* or JDE, owner of the brands, is currently fighting a global instant coffee market share battle with Nestlé. Last year, it pulled even with Nestle in terms of retail coffee volumes, though its sales still lag by value.

South African coffee drinkers can expect cheaper instant coffee for longer thanks to the strong rand and lower coffee bean prices worldwide.

Arabica coffee bean prices have slumped by 15% in the past years thanks to expected bumper harvests in South America. Brazil expects that its output of robusta beans, the lower quality bean usually used in instant coffee, will rise 30% this year.

AVI hopes lower prices will help drive volumes and profit margins on its coffee brands in the second half of the year.
• Jacobs Douwe Egberts is a Dutch privately-owned company that owns a number of beverage brands (coffee, tea and hot chocolate). It was formed in 2015 following the merger of the coffee division of Mondelez International with Douwe Egberts.

Carlos Brito, CEO of AB InBev (above), the world’s largest beer company, said at the recent release of the company’s full-year results that the tie up with SABMiller in 2016 had “exceeded expectations”.

The acquisition of the South African brewer helped the group grow its revenue 5.1% to $45.5 billion during the year to end-December 2017.

With the acquisition virtually bedded down, synergies extracted and respectable earnings for the year, AB InBev is now focused externally with plans to capitalize on the promise of SABMiller – growth in Africa.

With the rebound in commodity prices in 2016 and 2017 the outlook for African beer markets is bright.

And against a backdrop of muted beer growth globally, the relatively under-developed beer market on the continent has global brewers salivating.

While AB InBev is the dominant player on the continent (thanks to SABMiller’s multi-decade investments there), the likes of Heineken and Diageo have been ratcheting up their competitive activity in the region.

Arguably, this wave started with Heineken’s decision in 2007 to repatriate the Amstel brand in South Africa and build its own brewery.

This was followed by SAB’s entry into Nigeria in 2012, and more recently with Heineken’s greenfield entry into the Ivory Coast and Mozambique. This is according to research from investment firm Sanford C Bernstein.

At this point, Africa is still a modest Africa contributor to AB InBev’s group profits. In the last year, Africa accounted for about 7% of group equity-adjusted EBIT.

“We are very positive about Africa,” says Ricardo Tadeu, AB InBev Africa president.

“In markets like Tanzania, Ghana, Nigeria, Mozambique, where consumption is lower per capita, we experienced mid-teen growth. South Africa is a more developed market and the rate of growth is not as fast.”

To maintain this type of growth, AB InBev is investing heavily in developing the right portfolio of products for each market, and in enhancing production capacity and distribution.

The brewer already sells everything it produces in Nigeria, for instance, and is planning a greenfields expansion project there. It has also expanded its operations in Zambia and Ghana.

“Having a local understanding of each market and each brand and how it connects to the consumer is very important. We are fortunate that SAB Miller has a well-developed sense of the markets it operated in.

“Affordability is key. Because GDP per capita is lower than average we must provide excellent products at the right price. If you can do that, and get it to consumers, you should do well,” says Tadeu.

Heineken earns a similar proportion of its earnings from Africa – about 8%. This is down from a healthy 18% in 2014, prior to the slump in Nigerian profitability.

Nigeria and South Africa are Heinekens biggest businesses in Africa, but it also has important businesses in Ethiopia, Egypt, Rwanda and Burundi, which fall outside the “Big 8” African beer markets, according to Bernstein.

Africa is smaller for Diageo, which earns 2-3% (also suppressed by the Nigerian slump) from its African beer operations, according to Bernstein.

But it is no less strategic, with Africa historically a key driver of Diageo’s beer business and Guinness in particular. This business will provide the platform from which to build a strong spirit business…..",Africa: Beer’s final frontier

Speaking to the drinks business during the launch of the 2015 vintage of his Ashbourne Pinotage in London recently, Hamilton Russell said:

“In 1996 I told Jancis Robinson MW that one day South Africa’s most famous wine will be made from Pinotage and she laughed at me.

“Brits have developed a prejudice about Pinotage but they love it in the US.

“In the past the grape has been widely mistreated. There was a sense of patriotism about it, but just because it’s South African doesn’t mean it’s good.

“The tendency has been to make extra-ripe, soft styles, which was a mistake. People give it a bad rap and accuse it of smelling like a mouse cage or a plaster, but those notes are nothing to do with Pinotage – that’s brett.

“Winemakers have traditionally turned their back on Pinotage as they wanted to shed their associations with the past and threw the baby out with the bath water as the grape is associated with old fashioned, narrow-minded attitudes.

“It presented its worst public face to the world as it was made by dyed- in-the-wool winemakers.”

But despite the grape’s less than glittering reputation, Hamilton Russell revealed that the Pinotage revival in South Africa is in full swing.

“If you have a glass of bad Pinotage you tend to write of the grape but young winemakers aren’t weighed down by the baggage of the past and are giving the grape a second chance and doing really interesting things with it.

“The Pinotage renaissance is happening in South Africa. I’ve been asking Eben Sadie [of Sadie Family Wines and the winner of the 2017 Winemakers’ Winemaker Award] to make one for years and he’s finally looking at it, as is Andrea Mullineux [co-owner and award-winning winemaker at Mullineux & Leeu Family Wines], which is really exciting as they have the potential to make something spectacular,” he said.

“Pinotage is an incredible thick-skinned, early ripening variety that has a great affinity with clay, which is why it works well on our soils in a cooler region.

“It’s my mission to prove that Pinotage is capable of greatness. I believe passionately in the greatness of the grape, particularly when planted in clay soils,” he added.

Ashbourne Pinotage is now made with 100% Pinotage from a 1.3-hectare single vineyard in Hemel-en-Aarde planted in 1996. Just nine barrels of the 2015 vintage were produced. The wine is aged in foudres for nine months.

Hamilton Russell is keen to expand the production the wine, which recently went on sale in the UK, if there is a global appetite for it.

“I want to develop Ashbourne Pinotage into a wine of reference that’s on sale all over the world,” he told db. He’s equally ambitious about the wine’s ageing potential, believing that the 2015 vintage will still be going strong 50 years from now.

“There is no reason why Pinotage should hang its head in shame when judged alongside the other top wines of the world. There is no benchmark for it at the moment,” he said.

The wine is named after Lord Ashbourne, who was Lord Chancellor of Ireland in the late 1800s, and also happens to be Hamilton Russell’s great, great grandfather.

A South African edition, in conjunction with Media24, was launched in February. Among its first reports is that of a tasting competition to find the best of SA’s favourite takeaway cappuccinos.

ARGUABLY the most important liquid fueling the economy, apart from petroleum, is coffee. And while everyone has their preferred brand of takeaway coffee, we were desperate to determine which one is the best.

We turned to an expert panel of Business Insider South Africa taste-testers to find our favourite. Our testers included Freeman Nofemele, a professional barista in Cape Town; Emily Cohn, head of audience development at Business Insider in New York, on visit in SA; and James de Villiers, journalist with Business Insider SA and self-proclaimed coffee addict.

The tasting team pitted Vida, Seattle, Wimpy, McDonalds, Woolworths and Mugg & Bean cappuccinos against each other. The testers were each served the coffee in unmarked cups and asked to score each cappuccino on a scale 1-10 (10 being the best).

Here’s how the cappuccinos stacked up:

Mugg & Bean. R23.90 for a small cappuccino. Average score: 0 out of 10

Instant derision from all three of the judges. They thought it was watery and lukewarm. “It doesn’t even taste like coffee,” says Emily. Freeman and James were in complete agreement. All three of them refused to give the cappuccino even a single point out of 10.

Wimpy R24.90 for a small cappuccino. Average score: 3 out of 10

Emily gave it marks for being stronger than some of the other contenders, but did not like the taste of it. “If you are only looking for some caffeine, this will probably do.” James and Freeman hated this cappuccino. “Burnt and too bitter,” said Freeman. “Wood in a cup,” according to James.

Vida e Caffè R25 for a small cappuccino. Average score: 4.2 out of 10

James thought it was very good, with a lovely aftertaste. But he was in the minority. Freeman and Emily gave it very low marks. Emily said the coffee had a stale taste and was bland, without any complexity. Freeman believed the coffee beans were burnt, and that the bits of the coffee grinds in the cup were testimony to that.

McDonald’s. R18 for a small cappuccino. Average score: 4.7 out of 10

James, who favours milky coffee, liked this one, but the others didn’t think much of the quality of the coffee. “It has no reach and a very weak taste, it lacks that boost that coffee should provide,” said Freeman. Emily thought it tasted like “warm milk with a shot of coffee in it”.

Seattle R23 for a small cappuccino. Average score: 6.5 out of 10

This was the only cappuccino that scored mutual admiration from all three of our judges. All of them thought the coffee tasted great. “A great combination of sweet and bitter,” says Freeman. They agreed that it was well balanced and creamy, and that the milk was of a high quality.

Woolworths R23 for a small cappuccino. Score: 6.7 out of 10

This cappuccino received nine out of ten from Freeman, who raved about the taste of the coffee, which he thought was complex, and the result of a “near perfect” extraction process. Emily also loved this cappuccino. “This is what coffee should taste like, strong, with good-tasting milk.” James disagreed on the taste of the milk, but liked the smell of the coffee.",Rating SA’s most popular takeout coffees — and the winner is clear

Renamed the Health Promotion Levy by government, this is the first tax in which government has committed some of the proceeds to health.

While Treasury generally refuses to ring-fence income from taxes, for the first time it has committed to giving a portion of the income to the health department to try to stop the diseases associated with high sugar diets such as diabetes, hypertension and strokes.

“We congratulate Parliament, Treasury and the Department of Health for resisting enormous pressure from the beverage industry and introducing the country’s first health tax,” said the Healthy Living Alliance, which campaigned for the tax over the past year.

“South Africa is the first country in Africa to tax sugary drinks and we hope the rest of the continent will follow suit, as the sugary beverage industry has identified Africa as a major new market.”

The Healthy Living Alliance’s Tracey Malawana described the levy as “one tax that no one has to pay. It’s a win-win if we refuse to pay the tax and consume water and milk instead. Our pockets and health both benefit.”

But what the effect of the tax will have on our health and exactly where the proceeds of the tax will go still remain to be seen.

“The tax will, of course, have some impact but not as much as we predicted because the tax rate has effectively been halved from the suggested 20% based on our research to 11%, following pressure from industry,” said Professor Karen Hofman, who heads Priceless, the Wits University think tank that first sold the idea of the tax to Treasury as one of the most cost-effective ways to address the surge of diet-related diseases such as diabetes.

“In Mexico a 10% tax still did have a significant impact reducing consumption by 6% in the first year and close to 10% in the second year,” added Hofman.

The tax was also the first to be negotiated in the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) after being referred there by Parliament which was concerned about possible job losses.

After these negotiations, Treasury reduced the tax to 2.1 cents per gram of sugar, but exempted the first four grams in every 100ml to encourage beverage manufacturers to reduce the sugar content in their drinks.

Last week, Coca-Cola said there would be price increases on “some of Coca-Cola’s products” but that “lower sugar (less than 4g/100ml) and zero sugar products and 100% juices” would not be affected.

“The Coca-Cola Company supports current recommendations of leading health authorities, including the World Health Organisation (WHO), that people should limit their intake of added sugar to no more than 10% of their total daily calorie/energy intake,” said Coca-Cola in a statement.

It added that it remained committed to working through Nedlac “to develop an effective anti-obesity solution that will preserve jobs while still meeting the country’s health objectives”.

More than three-quarters of South Africans supported government taking measures to reduce their consumption of sugary drinks, according to research conducted last year by economic research company Genesis Analytics. However, some respondents were wary of the proceeds being swallowed up by a rapacious state.

Government seems to be keen to use some of the proceeds to finance a multisectoral body along the lines of the SA National AIDS Council (Sanac) to address non-communicable diseases that are largely caused by poor diet, obesity and lack of exercise. But this could be an expensive talk shop if not properly managed.

“We will be watching carefully to see how government allocates the proceeds of the tax, as it is supposed to go towards health promotion,” the Healthy Living Alliance’s Malawana warned.

Meanwhile, the Free Market Foundation said: “Taxing sugar and other ‘sinful products’ is a blunt instrument that, besides treating adults like children, diverts attention from government’s desire to control ordinary people’s lives and to raise revenue by any means possible.”

But Priceless’s Hofman said that the consumption of sugary drinks is a “very significant factor in driving obesity”.

“For adults, drinking just one of these beverages a day increases the likelihood of being overweight by almost 30% and by 50% for children,” said Hofman.

“Critics of the tax overlook the fact that currently we may have less of a ‘choice’ than we think. Food and beverage choices are shaped by availability, affordability and relentless marketing. Consumers are manipulated from early childhood to make unhealthy choices,” she said.

Priceless holds that the tax is “long overdue” but needs to be followed by complementary measures such as warning labels on processed food and marketing and advertising regulations to restrict junk food being promoted to children.

There has been a lot of controversy surrounding the sugar tax which was officially implemented on April 1. The tax, equivalent to a levy of about 11 percent on can of coke, is aimed at tackling South Africa’s obesity epidemic and the diseases associated with it.

South Africans may be very fond of alcohol, but this hasn’t stopped entrepreneurs from looking for alternatives. Enter The Duchess, a brand that is described as the world’s first non-alcoholic and sugar-free gin and tonic (G&T). The SA-crafted drink has sold 500,000 bottles in the less than two years since it was created.

Distilled by Johannes le Roux and Inus Smuts, the beverage is produced in Cape Town and is available in stores such as Makro, Spar and Pick n Pay.

But it was online retailer Yuppiechef that gave The Duchess its first retail platform, in late 2016.

According to Le Roux, he had the idea after his visit to Amsterdam during the summer of 2016, when he noticed the popularity of gin all over the city.

“I also noticed that globally people are more health-conscious (specifically the war on sugar) which made me ask: can I create a beverage that speaks to both these challenges and opportunities?”

By crafting a non-alcoholic G&T, he was able to reach gin connoisseurs, while also providing a healthier alternative to alcohol, which would attract a different category of consumer.

The “secret recipe” of The Duchess G&T includes a key ingredient from Le Roux’s botanist aunt’s unique aromatic botanicals, sourced in Cape Town. It also uses distilled gin extracts, which are imported. Its other ingredients include orange peel, allspice, star anise, cardamom and cloves.

Le Roux describes The Duchess’s consumer as a health-conscious, successful, sophisticated and discerning individual seeking new experiences.

“Whether it’s because one is at a business lunch or is the designated driver, or for personal or health reasons, The Duchess offers people the choice of a low-calorie, nonalcoholic and refreshing beverage,” he says.

Le Roux says The Duchess will continue to develop non-alcoholic drinks within the global beverage sector. It recently launched a new flavour — The Duchess Floral.

It also has plans to expand into more countries, following its entry into the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Scandinavia, where he says governments have encouraged nonalcoholic alternatives.

“Our plan is to launch in Japan, the UAE, Australia and then finally the US.”

Le Roux won’t reveal sales figures for The Duchess in SA, but he says the country remains its largest market.

The Duchess employs eight people. And it has yet to find the right partners.

“We have not concluded any funding deal so far, as we believe that finding the right visionary partner is crucial to ensure that The Duchess can live up to the dream I had when I was in Amsterdam,” Le Roux says.

A recovery in SA consumer confidence this year is expected to result in more spending. That means more packaged goods are likely to be bought – which is good for the companies like Nampak, who says it expects increased demand for packaging to drive growth in volumes and its overall performance this year.

While the recovery has fed through to its Metals and Plastics divisions, it seems that Glass can’t keep up due to structural problems at the unit, which it has now decided to sell.

It plans to approach packaging industry players to invite proposals for the sale of the business and says exploratory talks have already been held.

It expects Glass to report a first-half loss as it can’t manufacture enough glass containers to satisfy demand. Municipal supply of electricity remains inconsistent, although it secured stable supply from the operation’s rotary uninterruptible power supply system for the second quarter.

It says it has also been held back by insufficient technical skills at the unit.

Nampak also reports it is facing an unnamed new entrant in the South African beverage can market.

“Discussions with a major customer regarding the renewal of an existing supply agreement that comes to an end on March 31 are in progress and we expect that some volume will be allocated to the new entrant,” Nampak notes.

Among JSE-listed companies, Nampak has been one of the most aggressive to expand into Africa outside of SA.

Five months into the new financial year, Nampak says Nigeria is displaying an improvement, having emerged from last year’s recession. While overall inflation remains high, wage inflation has now caught up and purchasing power has been restored, resulting in stronger consumer demand.

It says small shifts in Nigeria’s roughly 194 million people contribute towards significant changes in demand and it has experienced volume growth substantially in excess of GDP growth in the five months to end February.

The introduction of the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market last April and a stronger oil price have also led to a big improvement in liquidity, with foreign currency reserves doubling to $44 billion.

In Angola, moves to devalue the kwanza to stimulate liquidity in the currency are seen as positive – although the devaluation has proceeded slower than expected, it says.

Nampak says its Bevcan division has shown pleasing growth in South African and Angola, with a “robust recovery” in Nigeria. It has also experienced stronger demand for fish and meat cans, while general metals packaging in the rest of Africa is trading to expectations, with modest growth in certain categories.

Its Plastics South Africa division has also seen a moderate volume recovery in certain sub-categories, but the performance for the five-month period has been impacted by the loss of volume from lower tender allocations by a major customer late last year.

It says this volume loss has been partially mitigated by higher capacity utilisation initiatives and strong water container demand throughout the country, especially in regions impacted by the drought.

The performance from its paper division has been mixed, with strong demand from Nigeria but subdued demand from Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi. It says if liquidity in Zimbabwe doesn’t improve in the second half of the year, the performance there will be subdued as more stringent requirements for customers have been put in place to limit exposure to that country.

Nampak says the stronger rand over the period will negatively impact its earnings from outside of South Africa but will benefit the translation of its dollar-denominated borrowings.

It says dollar shortages in Angola and Zimbabwe and the series of expected currency devaluations in Angola could result in potential foreign currency translation impacts.

Its results for the six months to end-March are scheduled for release at the end of May. Its shares sank 9.8% to R15.20 last Thursday.",Nampak looking to sell its glass division

Business has come to the rescue…

This month, PETCO associate member, Oasis Water, recycling experts, Extrupet, and PETCO have transported 15 tonnes of baled bottles to the Extrupet facility in Gauteng for processing.

This is to overcome the challenge and prevent these additional bottles having to be sent to landfill.

Chandru Wadhwani, joint MD of Extrupet and PETCO board member, says: “For me the pressing driver here is to ensure that the extra volume of PET bottles that have found their way to the Western Cape on the back of the water crisis finds a home in a recycled product.

“Just by way of scale, the load 15 tons on the truck sponsored by Oasis Water, means half a million bottles will now be recycled that otherwise wouldn’t have been.

“This is the ultimate value of this initiative and companies like Oasis Water need to be commended – they set the perfect example of what extended producer responsibility entails.”

Group director of Oasis Water, Naas du Preez, says: “With the influx of bottled water into Cape Town we believe, as a responsible brand, that we must also assist and be depended upon to take care of the environment and have sponsored the transport as a sign of goodwill.

“We are also challenging fellow bottlers and players in the industry to do the same and assist with keeping recycling responsible.”

PETCO is now monitoring the situation closely to determine whether additional transportation will be needed to ease the burden on the Western Cape recycling capacity, and encourages other companies to offer financial support should this become necessary.

The PET recycling company (PETCO) has made massive strides in increasing SA recycling rates in recent years, resulting in a 55% tally in 2016- that means more than 90 000 tonnes of PET or two billion bottles being recycled each year.

PETCO CEO, Cheri Scholtz, says this effectively means that SA is currently recycling more than half of all post-consumer PET bottles in the market and more bottles are being recycled than those going into landfill.

“Through the remarkable network of people, companies and organisations we work with, we have created more than 60,000 income opportunities for small and micro-collectors, changing their lives and those of their families in immeasurable ways and injecting almost R900-million into the economy to date.”

PETCO’s contracted recycling partner, Extrupet, has a fibre producing plant in Milnerton in Cape Town and a bottle-2-bottle plant in Wadeville, Johannesburg, where recycled PET plastic bottles are used to manufacture new bottles for many food-grade applications or recycled into a myriad new and useful products such as polyester fibre for duvets and pillows, jeans and t-shirts, and reusable shopping bags.

South African consumers, says Distell, are becoming aware of the benefits of boxed wine and following the trend, leading to an increase in local boxed wine sales.

“We’ve seen a significant 34% growth in sales for the Drostdy Hof three-litre bag-in-box wine compared to the previous financial year,” says Frans Booysen, marketing manager of Accessible Wines at Distell.

Local consumers have shown “more sensitivity to prices due to economic turmoil experienced in 2016” which could promote more affordable drinking purchases, such as bag-in-box wine. (Euromonitor, 2017)

“Another factor contributing to the recent growth in sales and popularity of boxed wine could be the versatility of the product, especially when used for social occasions,” comments Booysen.

• It can be transported to any occasion with ease – instead of having 4 bottles, you have a 3L pack
• It takes up less space in the fridge

In addition, cheaper, therefore more accessible, illegal alcohol products encourage binge drinking and underage alcohol consumption and pose a serious risk to the health and safety of individuals as they contain potentially dangerous substances.

This is according to a Euromonitor International study undertaken in to determine the impact of the illicit trade of alcohol in seven African countries, including South Africa.

The study, which engaged local manufacturers, trade associations and government, among other relevant stakeholders, highlighted that the largest share of the fiscal loss was attributed to smuggling of final alcohol products and raw ethanol used in the production of alcohol, amounting to R2.4bn.

Tax leakage is the next highest contributor to the fiscal loss in 2017 at R2bn.

According to the Euromonitor study, consumption of illicit alcohol in South Africa reached 14.5% or 498-million litres of the total combined illicit and licit alcohol volume consumed in 2017. This represents an annual growth rate of around 4.3% between 2012 and 2017.

Across the globe, the Euromonitor study reported that 1 in 4 alcohol bottles of alcohol consumed are illicit, representing 25.8% of the alcohol market. The global results include a multi-region report, which compiles findings from 24 countries in Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America.

In South Africa, Euromonitor notes that the growth in illicit alcohol activity is driven by the challenging economic environment, weak regulation enforcement and taxation strategies driving up legal or licit alcohol prices.

From a consumer perspective, it is all about cost and price sensitivity. Often, where an illicit product has the familiar packaging of a popular brand, consumers don’t realise that it is illicit because they lack knowledge and education about legal product recognition.

The difference between illicit and legal alcohol prices averaged 51% in 2017. Due to the year-on-year increases in excise rates over the past 10 years, unit prices for alcohol, particularly spirits, have increased substantially. This high disparity between illicit and legal alcohol costs incentivises illicit activity.

The study identified four key themes that are shaping South Africa’s illicit alcohol trade and affecting the initiatives intended to reduce it:

It is estimated, according to the Department of Trade and Industry (dti),that the number of illegal, unlicensed alcohol outlets is more than double that of licensed outlets and only 20% of the estimated 150 000 traders in South Africa have attempted to obtain a liquor license.

According to the WHO, only 42% of the adult (aged 15+) South African population are consumers of alcohol, yet the country’s annual per capita consumption of 27.1-litres of pure alcohol among drinkers is very high by the international comparison of 17.2-litres of pure alcohol in 2010.

On paper, South Africa’s alcohol-related regulatory framework is considered to be strong and includes heavy criminal sanctions. However, in reality, enforcement of existing laws is hampered by a three-tier system of national, provincial and local responsibilities, missing inter-governmental cooperation, and a lack of resources.

In an effort to combat excessive alcohol consumption and generate revenue, the South African government has focused on raising excise. As a result, excise duties on alcohol have increased above the rate of inflation since 2002 for beer and spirits over the last 10 years.

However, given that illicit alcoholic beverages produced are from unregistered entities, this strategy puts a greater burden on the compliant and registered sector of the industry.

The groundbreaking findings from the study clearly demonstrate a need to improve regulatory conditions. Euromonitor recommends a multifaceted, rational approach to legislation, education and licensing with the emphasis on the following:
• Enhanced enforcement through private and public partnerships for capacity building and training.
• Creation of an enabling environment to encourage licensing and responsible trading.",SA loses R6-bn+ in revenue to illicit alcohol trade

Starbucks’ Rooibos Lattes come in two variants: Rooibos Tea Latte and Red Apple Rooibos Tea Latte.

The drinks are described as “luxurious” and are made by using a new method to extract maximum flavour from the tea, which took the company two years to perfect.

The Rooibos lattes were rolled out to 950 stores across the UK – one of the biggest tea-drinking markets in the world.

Adele du Toit, spokesperson for the SA Rooibos Council says it’s a real thrill to have Rooibos feature so prominently on Starbucks’ UK menus and speaks to the growing popularity of the tea and demand for health-promoting beverages worldwide.

“In a region where a whopping 60 billion cups of tea are consumed each year, with over 1 200 varieties to choose from, it’s a big deal for Rooibos to have been given the nod by the Brits,” she says.

Du Toit also describes it as one of SA’s most versatile products, with big brands like Starbucks capitalising on Rooibos’ many health benefits due to its high level of antioxidants.

“There is a lot of innovation happening in the Rooibos tea category and marketers are exploring a variety of mixes and product offerings,” she adds.

“Ready-to-drink tea products, such as Rooibos Cappuccinos and Rooibos Lattes are at the forefront of this growth as they fit squarely into the time-crunched, but health-seeking lifestyle of consumers.

“For the younger generation a standard cup of tea is no longer enough. Millennials want higher quality tea and lots of different options and flavours to choose from.

“Personalised hot beverages is another emerging trend where in-store touchscreens and digital channels sync with shoppers’ social media profiles to suggest different flavour combinations, based on their personalities.

“For example, consumers could select a Rooibos chocolate, spice or fruit infusion, while further toppings can be added to create a bespoke product that matches a customer’s personality or mood at any given time.

“The global resurgence in the tea category points to consumers wanting to drink better quality tea when they put the kettle on.

“Flavoured and speciality teas are perceived as more of an indulgence and consumers who are buying these drinks are willing to spend that bit more on their cup of tea.”

The Sun reports that the Rooibos duo are joined by a trendy matcha latte, and that the short drinks are retailing for £2.75.

The new brews are served pure with semi-skimmed milk, and contain zero added sugar.

Said Charlotta Oldham, from Starbucks in the UK: “We are committed to innovation and creating new, delicious drinks for our customers.

“Our new Teavana Tea Lattes are a new way of extracting flavour from tea leaves, where the tea leaves are ground into a very fine powder and then blended with steamed milk – a recipe only possible thanks to the experience and craftsmanship of our baristas.”

South Africa currently exports Rooibos tea to over 30 countries, including the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and US. It is exclusively grown in the Cederberg area of the Western Cape and is arguably one of SA’s best exports.

The growing global interest in the tea will help to enhance the demand for local produce, while stimulating much-needed local economic activity.

Carbotect will tell you, simply, cheaply and immediately

With food safety and factory hygiene the flashing stars atop the SA food industry’s priority pyramid, there was never a more apt time for the relaunch of Carbotect, an innovative, locally-developed factory hygiene management tool that offers a multitude of benefits.

Developed by savvy chemist, Dr Robin Kirkpatrick (one of the original developers of SA’s now globally famed ‘radical water’), Carbotect was originally introduced in 2014 as a simple ‘Stop/Go’ cleaning verification test in the food and beverage industries.

Since then the technology has undergone a further four years of reformulation, redesign and repackaging, as Kirkpatrick explains: “With our new, disruptive hygiene management tool we’ve moved ahead to effectively create an instant QA laboratory in a box – and are offering a valuable and cost-effective adjunct to conventional hygiene monitoring and QA/QS programmes.”
• It is a proactive approach, allowing the instant and reliable detection of inadequate hygiene practices on the factory floor – before product is processed and pre-empting the mad reactive scramble when lab tests come back negative.
• Its repeatable sensitivity to ultra-low levels of organic compounds means that it has the capacity to detect the presence of biofilms in water supply systems – thus further mitigating microbial contamination in high-risk facilities.
• It is a simple, colour-based, user-friendly and CAPEX-free diagnostic test, and a unique opportunity to empower production staff and to underwrite product integrity.
• It is specifically geared to afford plant production personnel with quality decision-making capacity on the factory floor without having to rely on costly laboratory interventions.
• The test is ideally suited to geographically-isolated food and beverage facilities without ready access to accredited laboratory capacity, or for continuous processing plants where laboratory facilities are not available on a 24/7 basis.

The Carbotect technology is sensitive to all carbon-based compounds and will detect all organic categories of food and beverage ingredients.

This extends from simple sugars and starches through to complex compounds including the variety of proteins of animal, fish and plant origin.

“The dual capacity of ultra-low-level sensitivity to a broad spectrum of contaminants means that the Carbotect test can be used as a ‘first pass’ assessment to confirm the presence of residual food allergens,” says Kirkpatrick.

“It thus offers a broad-based screening result against all potentially hazardous allergen residues – prior to embarking on costly allergen-specific testing in a competent laboratory.”

Carbotect is available as a single-use sachet, a standardised 100ml sample bottle and the proprietary colour comparison chart.

The final rinse water sample is collected, the contents of the sachet are added and the colour reaction that develops within 5 minutes provides a definitive result as to whether and at what measure, organic contaminants are present in the sample (see more on the video below).

“Carbotect is a novel and proven technology which drives the shift away from a conventionally reactive intervention strategy to a more proactive and holistically quality assured outcome,” Kirkpatrick concludes.

Carbotect is currently available through the following agencies:","How clean is your beverage plant, really? Carbotect will tell you, simply, cheaply and immediately"

It’s the KwaZulu-Natal-based company’s biggest one-day collapse in more than 22 years. The share price ended trade at its lowest level in about 14 years.

The 127-year-old sugar producer has a number of issues crippling its operations and says it is undergoing a “comprehensive strategic and financial review with the view to stabilising the business”.

At the core of Tongaat’s falling sales are a number of supply-side challenges. The global market is oversupplied with sugar, leading to a drop in the sugar price.

Locally, the problem has been exacerbated by the recently introduced sugar tax that has had a negative impact on sugar sales in SA.

In Mozambique, where Tongaat has operations, cheap imports are affecting demand for its products.

Last week, finance minister Tito Mboweni added to Tongaat’s pain by increasing the sugar tax by 10% from R2.01 to R2.21 per gram in excess of four grams of sugar per 100ml.

Executive changes over the past year have put the company’s leadership at the fore for investors.

Last year, long-serving CEO Peter Staude was hounded out by Investec analyst Anthony Geard. Staude left the company last October, much earlier than his expected April 2019 retirement.

He was replaced by the former head of Tongaat’s Zimbabwe business, Sydney Mtsambiwa, who was himself replaced this month by Gavin Hudson. The company has also confirmed acting CFO Rob David Aitken in that position.

Last year, Tongaat faced tough questions from its shareholders on the pay and performance of its executives.

On the executive changes, Wayne McCurrie, of FNB Wealth and Investments, said there was a lot out of the company’s control.

“Unfortunately, as with any agricultural company and as with just about any mining company, a lot of their future is not in their hands.

“It’s not in their control, it’s the sugar price, it’s government tax, it’s the weather. These are very cyclical companies, so I don’t think it’s a reflection on the management of the company that’s caused this.”

In Zimbabwe, the company faces uncertainty as the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe this week announced its monetary policy for the year, which could have an impact on how companies account for revenues and ease of repatriating dividends to SA.

In SA, property sales have dropped significantly since September 2018, adding to pressure on the company’s revenue.

Tongaat has a substantial property division, which in previous years has bolstered the company’s bottom line.

Tongaat has operations in a number of SADC countries, but its South African business in particular has seen an over-reliance on land valuations that have since declined, sending the balance sheet into disarray.

One of the biggest issues facing the company in SA is an inability to focus on its core business of producing sugar.

The company, which will release its results in May, will also likely revalue its sugar-cane assets, taking into account the lower sugar price and weak demand.

McCurrie said the land sales issue and the impact of the sugar tax were the main reasons for Tongaat Hulett’s performance and the resultant share-price drop.

“The land sales disappointed the market and then the impact of the sugar tax on consumption and stock levels and imports of sugar.

“It was, quite frankly, a tale of woe and hence the share price is down 20%,” McCurrie said.",Tongaat sours on sugar tax

Sammy Mhaule got his first taste of entrepreneurship as a 14-year-old when he sold ice cream on the streets of Tembisa. Today, he’s the CEO of his own company, Skyrule Drink, supplier of sparkling juices to the Checkers group.

The journey from ice cream peddler to business owner hasn’t always been smooth sailing.

“The members of my family are not wired like me and they did not understand why I was willing to risk so much to run my own business,” says the 39-year-old, who has formal qualifications as a mechanical engineer and marketer.

The idea for his products came from an opportunity to capitalise on South Africa hosting the 2010 Soccer World Cup by supplying non-sparkling juice to hotels.

“After the World Cup I got requests for my juice to be more readily available on retail shelves. My challenge was to not introduce yet another fruit juice. I wanted a product with character, which would stand out from everything else on the shelves.”

His light-bulb moment came one day as he was walking down a drinks aisle and realised there weren’t many sparkling juices in which at least two flavours were blended.

He incubated this idea for 18 months, a period in which he also enrolled in a supplier development programme. “I knew I needed support to develop myself to ensure Skyrule Drinks thrived.”

In 2017 he was approached by Celia Theron, a former divisional buyer for the Shoprite Group, who had heard of his product and took a keen interest in it.

In the same year, Theron joined Skyrule Drinks as its National Key Account. Within a year of that initial contact, his drinks were available in Checkers Hyper stores in Gauteng. They are also available in Checkers stores in the Free State and they now have their sights set on supplying to the Eastern Cape in the near future.

The beverage company is based in Kempton Park. It was important for Mhaule to locate his business close to the community that nurtured him and today he employs ten people from the area.

For Mhaule the best part of being an entrepreneur is the knowledge that his destiny is in his own hands.

“There is nothing glamorous about being an entrepreneur. You must have the right reasons for starting your business. You also need to know how to use your gifts to achieve your goals.”

In 10 years’ time, Mhaule hopes to own three manufacturing plants in three provinces. “I also want Skyrule Twyst to ultimately be the beverage of choice for every customer that walks into a Checkers or Shoprite store,” he concludes.",From township entrepreneur to the supermarket shelf
,"February 27, 2019",https://www.drinkstuff-sa.co.za/wp-content/uploads/PolyPet-Range.jpg,https://www.drinkstuff-sa.co.za/understanding-pet-bottle-choice-for-recycling-in-sa/,"Polyoak Packaging is a major supplier of PET bottles to the SA beverage sector – here it discusses the role of PET and optimal choices brands should consider for recycling.

Polyoak has been a contributing member of Petco, the PET industry’s recycling body, since its inception in 2004, and actively participates on the Petco board.

In 2018, Petco and its member companies who pay the voluntary levy, facilitated the collection and recycling of 103 kilo tonnes of post-consumer PET bottles. That saved South Africa’s landfill space the size of about 250 Olympic-sized swimming pools!

Lightweighting

Polyoak’s Wessel Oelofse, its national executive for its specialist PET division, Polypet, reiterates that PET has significant advantages as a packaging material because of its strength, thermo-stability and clarity.

It’s shatterproof, safe, hygienic, portable, re-sealable, lightweight, easy to recycle and cost effective. According to Petco, the weight of PET packaging has reduced by more than 30% over the last decade.

Oelofse agrees, “Over the last ten years Polypet has reduced the weight of its 4 and 5-litre PET bottles by an average of 30%, while maximising robustness and improving top load strength.

“Smart design has improved performance, whilst utilising significantly less resources to deliver a greener footprint. Lightweighting will continue to be an important lever in the global quest for more sustainable packaging.”

Recyclability of PET

Another major advantage of PET is that it is highly recyclable. According to Petco, 66% of all PET purchased in SA during 2018 was recycled. That’s significantly up from 52% just three years earlier.

Of all the bottles recycled, only 38% were re-processed into bottle-2-food grade products, such as new PET bottles.

Oelofse says, “There is still headroom, especially as the demand for food grade recycled PET (rPET) continues to grow, and brand owners and retailers respond to consumers’ demand for packaging containing recycled material.”

The challenge is that only natural (clear) and light blue PET bottles can be re-processed into food grade rPET.

“Thus, it is essential for more of our trusted brands to switch from coloured to clear PET, to increase the production and availability of recycled material, for inclusion in their packaging,” he comments.

“Retailers, brand owners and consumers will sleep better at night, whilst they enjoy the related economic and environmental benefits.”

Clear PET has many other advantages over coloured PET including a lower cost and waste component, more certainty of supply as natural preforms are usually stock items, and improved colour matching when adding rPET to clear PET.

“From a regulatory perspective, if South Africa follows UK and EU legislation, it is likely that packaging that is not easily recyclable, or does not contain recycled material, may incur penalties, so there is early mover advantage for brands ready to embrace sustainable packaging,” he adds.

Migration to PET

Countries such as France are experiencing a growing preference for PET over other packaging materials, likely due to the economic, technical and aesthetic advantages of PET being cost-effective and providing a good oxygen barrier clarity which gives a premium perception.

“This move is prevalent in categories such as detergents, hygiene, personal care and value-added dairy products, even in South Africa. Unfortunately, many of these packs have moved to PET which is opaque (white or ivory), and thus not readily recycled,” says Oelofse.

Opaque PET is not recycled

In South Africa, opaque and fluorescent PET bottles are not readily recycled, because there are no end-use markets, according to Extrupet’s Chandru Wadhwani.

“They cause blockages to the die heads on the fibre plant due to the types of masterbatches used,” he explains. “Opaque PET bottles also have zero value to collectors as recyclers don’t want them. Thus, they are likely destined for landfill or the ocean, and from a recycling and brand equity perspective, are best avoided.”

Coloured PET is problematic

Coloured or highly pigmented PET bottles comprise only about 15% of all the PET bottles collected by recyclers in South Africa currently, according to Extrupet.

Coloured PET can only be used in the production of fibre, geotextiles and strapping. Unfortunately, there is not much demand locally for these products, and surplus coloured PET can no longer be exported to China given their ban on recycled plastics.

As a result, collectors earn up to 40% less for coloured PET, than they would for clear PET. This disincentivises the collection of coloured PET bottles, which risk ending up as litter or as plastic waste in the ocean.

“Some brands have already understood and embraced the need to move from coloured to clear PET in a bid to improve recycling,” notes Oelofse.

“Examples include Sprite Zero, and Schweppes Tonic Water and Ginger Ale, whose bottles have changed from green and brown PET to natural (clear) PET.

“In the dairy category, Fair Cape transitioned from white to clear PET bottles for its milk and cream range, opting for a fully recyclable LDPE stretch sleeve.”

Oelofse continues, “There is a significant opportunity for more categories to transition to clear PET bottles, including CSD’s (ginger beer and crème soda), lemon juice, sauces and dairy products.

“Polyoak invites brand owners to partner with us to create recycling-friendly packaging that will help gain the respect and loyalty of their consumers.”

Often the rationale for choosing coloured PET is less technical, and more about the category nuance, he notes.

“Green just is lemon juice. Ginger beer in a brown bottle packs more Kwesta! Sometimes opaque or coloured PET is used to obscure the contents of the bottle, especially where settling or separation may occur. Who wants to buy a bottle with sediment lurking at the bottom?

“There’s certainly an opportunity for marketers to help shift perceptions that hamper recycling. Fortunately, Polyoak offers various recycling-friendly decoration alternatives, which would enable brands to switch to clear PET bottles, whilst still protecting their product and projecting appetite appeal.

“It’s important to partner with a packaging supplier with the relevant experience and commitment, to ensure that your pack is truly as recyclable as it can be.

“Design, functionality, material, decoration and closures all need to be taken into careful consideration, to deliver a truly recyclable pack.”

The Big Picture

 Making packaging easier to recycle is only one small piece of the puzzle though. At the top of the agenda needs to be infrastructure development to collect and manage waste and increase recycling.

This is a major problem globally where only two billion out of seven billion people have proper waste collection services. This issue is amplified in South Africa, where dumping of litter is rife because municipalities have failed in their duty to provide its citizens with proper waste collection services.

Subsequently this litter harms our environment, and is swept into rivers by wind, rain and floodwater. Ultimately it ends up polluting our oceans.

Oelofse concludes, “Polyoak is passionate about its commitment to the environment. Plastic bottles do not belong in the ocean. We should be doing everything we can to stop litter through better waste collection, to facilitate recycling of something as functional and valuable as plastic.”

More than 2 000 tons were shipped to its shores last year – the largest consignment since Rooibos was first introduced to the Japanese in the ‘80s.

Martin Bergh, chairperson of the SA Rooibos Council (SARC) says it hasn’t been easy breaking into the Japanese market, but that Rooibos is starting to make some serious inroads.

“The Japanese are spoilt for choice. They have more than 26 different types of tea to choose from, which range from their traditional green tea varieties to jasmine and barley tea or ‘mugicha’ as it is known among the locals, so Rooibos has been up against stiff competition.

“Over the years, Rooibos has carved a niche for itself as a refreshing health tea, which has resonated with the ultra-health-conscious Japanese market. Today, it counts among the leading teas in Japan’s ‘Healthy Tea’ segment.

“While the Western world has known about the risks associated with drinking too much caffeine for years, the Japanese have only recently taken notice of it. This has helped to increase Rooibos’ appeal since it is low in tannins and completely caffeine-free.

“The general trend toward natural health and wellness products continue to exert a growing influence on purchasing patterns in the region and as more of Rooibos’ health benefits become known in the East, we anticipate the demand for the product to grow,” says Bergh.

Exports to Japan more than tripled in the last five years as Rooibos’ presence increased in mainstream supermarkets with many launching their own private label products.

Popular restaurant chains, like Ippudo, has also done a lot to promote Rooibos in Japan. Instead of serving water with their pork bone broth, which is a traditional favourite, they switched to Rooibos tea instead as they felt its clean taste complemented the dish better.

Bergh points out that the Japanese are purists and therefore prefer to drink Rooibos tea unflavoured, without any milk or sugar. “Rooibos is mostly prepared as a hot or cold water infusion in large pots or servers rather than single servings. Hence the larger teabag sizes of 3.0g or more.

“In the past, Rooibos was consumed more in summer for hydration, but has now become an all-year-round tea product which all generations of consumers, from children to the elderly enjoy.

“Among the youth, our homegrown brew is also gaining traction as a ready-to-drink or frozen beverage, middle-aged women consume it specifically for its beauty and age-defying benefits, while the elderly drink it as a sleep elixir.

“The majority by far still favours the red, fermented Rooibos, but there is a growing interest in unfermented, green Rooibos too. Rooibos is also a popular product in cosmetics, food and puddings, as well as liquor.”

Even though Rooibos only makes up a tiny slice of the 200 000 tons of tea consumed in Japan per year, it is faring well above the annual 2.3% growth rate for the tea industry, clocking up a 7% increase in sales last year.

“With a market as big as Japan’s 126 million-strong tea-loving population, always eager to experiment with new products, Rooibos offers endless possibilities,” Bergh concludes.",Rooibos booms in Japan

The new C5 dairy HDPE closure is 25% lighter than its predecessor, says the company, making it the lightest dairy solution in South Africa.

The C5 opens easily thanks to its knurled grip design. Upon first opening, its tamper band breaks cleanly and drops down to make tampering immediately visible.

Best of all, the band remains securely attached to the bottle to reduce littering.

The C5 dairy closure is compression moulded for energy efficiency, with 100% camera inspection for consistently high quality. The smart design reduces the required application torque, making this closure more energy efficient all round.

Last year, South Africa imported 42 million bottles of Scottish whisky – more than one bottle per adult in the country.

This makes the country the ninth largest market for Scotch whisky in the world, measured by volume, according to the Scotch Whisky Association. Owners of brands like Glenfiddich, Dewar’s, Johnnie Walker and Chivas are all members.

Some £94-million (around R1.8-billion) of Scotch whisky was exported to South Africa last year.

And judging from a recent court case, whisky exporters are not tolerating any interlopers – especially not “whisky flavoured” cane.

Scotch whisky is heavily regulated worldwide, and producers are required to comply with strict rules before they can put “whisky” or any other inference to Scotland on a label. Only certain inputs (cereal grains, water and yeast) are allowed, it must be distilled in Scotland and the liquid must be matured there for at least three years, in oak casks.

Last week, the Pretoria high court issued an interdict against the South African producer of the King Arthur and Royal Douglas “whisky-flavoured spirit aperitifs”, Netwerk24 reported.

The SWA contended that the public could be mislead by the products’ colour, labelling and brand names into thinking they were buying whisky.

“Courts across many jurisdictions have ruled that Scottish names, such as ‘Douglas’, and images, such as tartan, are so strongly associated with Scotland and Scotch Whisky that they cannot be used on other whiskies of any other origin,” SWA legal counsel Andrew Swift told Business Insider SA.

“The SWA has consistently taken action in our global markets to prevent the use of Scottish and UK indications of origin on whisky which is not Scotch Whisky. This is vital to protecting Scotland’s national drink and is a deterrent to those who seek to take advantage of the quality reputation of Scotch Whisky and potentially mislead consumers.

“We are pleased with the court’s judgment which upholds the strong legal protection of Scotch Whisky in South Africa.”

But the South African company behind the brands will appeal the decision. Sean Haupt of Milestone Beverage says that the products clearly state that they aren’t whiskies, but falls under the “spirit aperitif” class of liquor.

As per the Liquor Product Act, these products need to contain at least 75g of sugar per 1 litre of spirit, he says. “The base of this product is a cane spirit whereby sugar, colourants and flavouring is added. So basically you can have any flavour spirit aperitif as long as it complies with the act and has the correct sugar versus alcohol ratio.”

He says their products are “vastly different” from whisky – it’s not matured, sugar is added and the flavours are not from raw materials.

“We could compare it to a cola for instance. It will never taste exactly the same a Coca-Cola, however there will be a similarity.”

But judging from the price list of at least one South Africa wholesaler, King Arthur was listed in the whisky category. It is currently selling for R859 for a case of 12 bottles (around R72 a bottle) – almost a third of the price of Bells and Jack Daniels.",SA producer of faux Scotch whisky stopped in tracks

This prompted the Western Cape Government into commissioning research into new ways to curb binge drinking.

The study, conducted by the School of Economics at the University of Cape Town (UCT), looked at various price-based interventions to reduce abusive drinking in the province and country.

Using data from the National Income Dynamics study, a nationally representative sample of 8,000 households was examined. Alcohol users were categorised into low dose, binge and heavy use. Participants were asked questions about regularity of alcohol use, quantity consumed typically and the amount of money spent on alcohol every month.

Through this data, researchers found the price paid for a unit of alcohol by each category of alcohol user, as follows, showing that people with heavy alcohol consumption supply themselves with cheap alcohol:
• Low dose alcohol consumers spent R 10.90 (adjusted for inflation) for a standard unit of alcohol

Some of the methods researched included increasing excise taxes or introducing a minimum unit price for alcohol. The study showed that if the cost of alcohol increased like it has in other countries, the consumption decreases.

According to the study, the pattern of drinking is not determined, primarily, by the quantity of alcohol consumed, but by how it is consumed. For example, drinking is flagged as dangerous if alcohol is typically consumed outside of mealtimes, out of the home, and to get drunk.

In May 2018, Scotland introduced a minimum unit price of 50p per unit (8g) of alcohol, with the aim of reducing abusive drinking.

The most effective way to reduce abusive drinking, according to the study, is to impose a minimum unit price (MUP) on alcohol, similar to the Scottish model.

Research shows that, even though binge drinkers and other heavy drinkers are less responsive to changes in the price of alcohol, the imposition of an MUP is likely to have a much larger impact on their consumption. The reason is that binge drinkers and other heavy drinkers, drink such cheap alcohol that a minimum unit price will substantially increase the price that they would have to pay.

South Africa’s situation is at least as bad as Scotland’s. Although only about one third of South African adults say they have ever consumed alcohol, nearly half of those that do, drink at dangerous levels.

The analysis done by the university indicates that if a R6 minimum unit price were instituted per standard drink, it would decrease alcohol consumption by 6.2% among binge drinkers, by 15.5% among other heavy drinkers, and by 4.6% among moderate drinkers.

The researchers further state the risk of increased alcohol prices leading to illicit home brewing is rather low. Their experience from the study of the economics of tobacco control, indicates the risk of illicit trade is often overstated by industry lobbyists, and is often attributed more to poor enforcement than to the level of the excise tax.

“While we do not suggest that the imposition of an MUP (or, for that matter, an increase in the excise tax on alcohol) is a silver bullet, it would indicate that the government is serious about addressing the crisis of alcohol abuse in the country, and would be a strong foundation on which other interventions can be built.”

,"May 28, 2019",https://www.drinkstuff-sa.co.za/wp-content/uploads/Sugar-tax-impact.jpg,https://www.drinkstuff-sa.co.za/sugar-tax-leaves-a-bitter-taste-for-the-beverage-sector/,"The sharp increase in the average selling price of sugary drinks in South Africa is starting to be felt. This is the impact of the national health promotion levy, more commonly referred to as the sugar tax, which was introduced last year, reports BMi Research.

Volumes in some beverage categories such as ready to drink fruit juice (nectar) and iced tea declined in 2018.

Other segments, like sparkling soft drinks, recorded significant volume declines in the second and third quarters of the year, but slight increases in the last quarter due to seasonal purchases prompted by summer and the holiday season.

As important as they are, figures like these only tell half the story – the negative impact of the sugar tax at the till. What about the broader effect of the tax on the beverages sector from a consumer perspective? Is it actually changing purchase behaviour as it was intended, to discourage the excessive consumption of high-sugar drinks among South Africans where rising obesity levels remain a concern?

The short answer is yes

These 2018 statistics combined with a negative 2019 outlook due to further sugar tax increases and continually shrinking disposable income, point to a definite change. Volumes are expected to stay low this year, with consumers even shifting completely to other types of beverages, like flavoured water, that are more affordable.

The long answer – or more accurately, the long-term answer – is a little more complicated. Along with these powerful market conditions that wield massive influence over where consumers spend their money, is the factor of entrenched consumer behaviour.

If sugary drinks are seen by consumers as a reward at the end of the day, or as an essential lunchtime treat, or assigned any other positive association by consumers, they are unlikely to allow a price increase to dull that shine.

The “sin” taxes bear witness to this hypothesis. Instead, they will adjust their lifestyle to suit the market conditions. This could mean dropping other non-essential items from their shopping baskets to ensure they can continue to buy their favourite sugary drinks at the higher price.

The other option is to buy a similar sugary drink but for a cheaper price. BMi Research’s surveys last year revealed that some middle to lower LSM consumers had shifted from buying premium brands to more affordable competitor products as selling prices soared.

Major market events like heightened taxes put brand loyalty under pressure, and are often the point of lost loyalty if the original, once-loved brand is perceived to no longer meet consumers’ needs, including their budget.

If either, or both, scenarios were in play, however, shouldn’t this translate into flat figures or at least, marginal growth?

The volumes of consumer market insights BMi Research has gathered over the past 10 years has shown us that South African consumers are conservative, and slow to adapt to change. But they’re also innovative, and we expect to see product usage change in the future as consumers find new ways to adjust to price increases.

For example, smaller bottles were previously regarded as convenient, but following the introduction of the sugar tax, two litre bottles were seen as offering better value. The smaller pack sizes took an instant hit, with volumes declining.

It is likely consumers are using two litre packs differently post-sugar tax, possibly by decanting the contents into smaller bottles to replicate that convenience factor while still capitalising on the more attractive, value-adding price point.

It is not only consumers who have been forced to innovate as a result of the levy; manufacturers prepared for the market impact by developing low-sugar and no-sugar variants that were launched the year before the tax was introduced. Production and sales of these variants shot up dramatically after 1 April 2018.

It’s too early to gauge how successful these variants will be in the future, as most producers indicated their customers did not like the new formulations as they didn’t taste the same the original ‘sugared’ product.

Customers were also sceptical about artificial sweeteners, following the bad press many sugar replacements had received in previous years.

Such market insights are vital, as they help manufacturers navigate what will continue to be a tough storm, with sugar taxes rising year on year with inflation increases. However, aside from simply allowing the sector to assess the evolving impact of the sugar tax on consumers, in-depth market research like this arms manufactures with a much more powerful weapon – a true understanding of what their customers really want at this time.

Because product, packaging and even promotional innovation means little if they all miss their mark. The only way to positively grow a sector under the current conditions is to ask consumers what they want, and then make sure you deliver on this.

Following debuts in Asia, Nestlé has launched its stalwart Milo beverage with a new recipe and substantially less sugar in South Africa.

“We have developed the new and improved Nestlé Milo recipe with 26% less sugar, more malt, more cocoa and more milk to give the right nutrients that children need to be energised for the day,” says Adedoja Ekeruche, Business Executive Officer – Dairy at Nestlé.

“This is part of our commitment to meeting the ever-changing consumer demand and providing healthier and tastier choices.”

Reducing added sugar is one of a wide range of commitments the company has made on nutrition, such as reducing the amount of salt and saturated fat in its products. At the same time it is committed to increasing healthier nutrients such as vitamins, minerals and whole grains.

The new recipe equates to less than a teaspoon of added table sugar in a glass. The rest of the sugar comes from lactose in dairy-based ingredients and barley malt extract. The product also contains carbohydrates, proteins, fat, vitamins and minerals to support children’s growth and development.

“A balanced diet provides energy that a child needs to grow, yet parents often struggle to meet this nutritional requirement,” says the Nestlé press release.

“Findings from the latest SA National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES) show that one in five children do not eat breakfast even though statistics show that this is the most important meal of the day. This number is of grave concern as it highlights the nutritional energy gap that exists as a result of skipping breakfast.

“Not having breakfast can make kids feel tired and restless as their bodies need to refuel for the day ahead after going without food for hours during sleep. Their mood and energy levels drop if they do not eat a proper morning meal.

“It is for this reason that Nestlé Milo, is committed to nourishing our nation’s children with the energy they need to go further and reach their potential.

“According to the WHO Africa Region, the continent will not be able to address under-nutrition and obesity-related diseases or meet global nutrition goals if the quality of our food does not change.

“While the energy needs of children are different, it remains pivotal to ensure that they consume a healthy intake of calories along with essential nutrients.

“Educating and encouraging parents and caregivers to realise the importance and value of breakfast in the development of our future leaders is a priority for Nestlé Milo.”",New Nestlé Milo breakfast energy drink with 26% less sugar

Now you can make an informed choice thanks to SA National Bottled Water Association (SANBWA), which has published a guide to the ‘taste’ of its members’ products.

Created in collaboration with the Sommeliers Association of SA (SASA) and the SA Chefs Association (SACA), the SANBWA guide clearly highlights that ‘not all waters are created equal’, although CEO Charlotte Metcalf is quick to point out only from an organoleptic point-of-view.

She stresses that all SANBWA members adhere to the same strict quality standards laid out in the SANBWA Bottled Water Standard.

“Bottled water, referred to as ‘packaged’ water in South African legislation, is appreciated not only as a calorie-free, healthy alternative to other packaged non-alcoholic beverages, but as a versatile companion to fine dishes, wine, coffee, brandies and whiskys, and so on,” Metcalf says.

“Depending on the mineral composition of the bottled water, as well as the presence or absence of ‘bubbles’, it can highlight and even enhance taste nuances.

“Together with tasters from SASA and SACA, we set out to explore the organoleptic characteristics of bottled waters available in South Africa with a view to providing a guide to which waters could satisfy certain culinary requirements.”

“‘Bouquet’ is the word used by beverage tasters when referring to the ‘nose’ or ‘smell’ of a beverage, while palate refers to the ‘taste’ or ‘flavour’.

The word ‘mouthfeel’ refers to how a beverage ‘feels’ in the mouth, mostly as a result of the interaction between ‘texture’ and ‘weight’, and can vary between still and carbonated versions of water from the same source.

“Our tasting panel confirmed that waters bottled from sources in South Africa, as well as imported waters found in the country, are mostly neutral with respect to smells and flavours. By contrast, considerable differences were found when it came to mouthfeel,” notes Metcalf.

“This obviously means that water will have little to no impact on the beverages or meals it is consumed with when it comes to aroma, but a much larger impact on the flavour profile or mouthfeel.

“If you are consuming a strongly-flavoured and hearty stew, the type of water you chose will probably not matter. But, if you are consuming a far more delicately spiced and textured dish, or add a splash of water to an expensive whisky or creating a coffee from hard-to-source beans, then the type of water you use can most definitely influence your experience.”

The SANBWA panel tasted sparkling and still, member and imported waters, as well as several from non-members, and has categorised them as follows (click image below to enlarge):

Waters that are soft with low minerality (salt) content often present as gentle and refined when we drink them. They are often the most refreshing to drink on their own to quench a thirst, and are very good to use when making or mixing with another beverage – such as coffee in a coffee machine or when adding water to whisky or brandy – because they do not impact the flavour profile of those beverages.

These waters have a slightly higher mineral content, and therefore more mouthfeel than those categorised as gentle and refined. They may also, depending on the mineral composition, present as slightly more savoury than those waters. They are refreshing and satisfying, and ideal ‘anytime’ beverages – solo to rehydrate and energise you, before or with a meal.

Waters with a high mineral content have greater mouthfeel and viscosity, which some people describe as a slightly oily texture, and this makes then appear full and smooth. Depending on the level of minerality, they can also have a slight salinity and, in some cases, this gives them quite a unique flavour profile. While some people will enjoy them with food, their obvious individuality means that they are mostly consumed solo, and probably not as a mixer with another beverage.

These waters have very low levels of minerality (salt) and carbonation. This means that the bubbles are delicate, and barely felt on the tongue and in the mouth. They could be described as being refined, or soft and graceful. This mellow nature makes them perfect meal companions because they clean the palate in a gentle way. The enhanced acidity from the carbonation is recognised as a classic palate cleanser.

With a slightly higher mineral content and racy, effervescent bubbles that persist for a long time in the glass, these waters are spirited and refreshing. Sometimes, this reviving characteristic is exacerbated by a slight salinity and bright acidity making them perfect for many occasions, solo or with food.

These are waters with high levels of carbonation which, in combination with an elevated mineral content, can create an irrepressible and flavoursome mouthful. They do refresh and stimulate and are most often drunk on their own or used as a ‘cocktail mixer’.",Revealing the tastes of South Africa’s bottled waters
