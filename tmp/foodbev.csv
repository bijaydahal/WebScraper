"JM Smucker’s Canadian subsidiary will invest $9.1m in its Sherbrooke, Quebec, manufacturing facility to increase condensed milk output.","February 13, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/JM-Smucker.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/jm-smucker-to-upgrade-quebec-facility-with-9-1m-investment/,"JM Smucker’s Canadian subsidiary will invest CAD 12 million ($9.1 million) in its Sherbrooke, Quebec, manufacturing facility to increase condensed milk output.

Smucker Foods of Canada said the investment, which is supported in part by funding from the Canadian Ministry of Agriculture, will be used to upgrade equipment that will allow the facility to boost its flexibility and the variety of products produced.

The Sherbrooke facility produces Carnation evaporated milk and Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk products for Canadian consumers.

Smucker said the improvement will also lead it broadening its sourcing of domestic milk in Canada.

“This investment will go a long way toward solidifying our long-term presence in Sherbrooke,” said Aurelio Calabretta, vice president and general manager for Smucker Foods of Canada.

“Through this initiative, we will be able to introduce new packaging capabilities previously unavailable to us in Canada.”

Lawrence MacAulay, Canada Minister of Agriculture, said: “The Government of Canada is proud to contribute to the modernisation and competitiveness of the dairy processing industry, helping it grow and prosper.

“We are committed to ensuring our world-class dairy processors stay on the cutting edge and continue to meet growing consumer demand for high-quality products while creating well-paying jobs for Canadians.”

Smucker began offering products in Canada in 1988 and today has offices in Sherbrooke, Montreal, Markham, Brampton and Calgary. The business offers brands such as Bick’s, Double Fruit, Five Roses, Folgers, Jif, Meow Mix, Milk-Bone and Nature’s Recipe.

Last year, JM Smucker offloaded its US baking business to private equity firm Brynwood Partners in a $375 million deal.

The transaction included products sold in US retail channels under the Pillsbury, Martha White, Hungry Jack, White Lily, and Jim Dandy brands, along with all relevant trademarks and licensing agreements.",JM Smucker to upgrade Quebec facility with $9.1m investment
"Coca-Cola Amatil’s Fijian business Paradise Beverages will release a new lemon-infused beer, as it targets drinkers who wouldn’t usually consider a beer.","February 12, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fiji-Gold.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/paradise-beverages-releases-fiji-gold-moli-lemon-infused-beer/,"Coca-Cola Amatil’s Fijian business Paradise Beverages will release a new lemon-infused beer, as it targets drinkers who wouldn’t usually consider a beer.

Called Fiji Gold Moli, the brew will be available in Fiji in the coming weeks in 6- and 24-pack cans, with draught to follow.

The release follows Paradise’s introduction of Vonu Original in 2012 and Vonu Export in 2016 and, according to the company, it is one of a number of new styles in the innovation pipeline at its brewery in Suva, Fiji.

Mike Spencer, Paradise Beverages general manager, said: “Fiji Gold Moli is a refreshing, lemon-flavoured take on the nation’s favourite brew, Fiji Gold, which we launched back in 1998 and became an instant hit.”

He added: “We recognise that Fijian tastes are changing. Consumers are looking for different beer styles to those that we’ve traditionally produced. Lemon-flavoured beers are on trend worldwide and we’re backing Moli’s refreshment and clean, crisp taste to be a hit in Fiji.”

Rowena Taito, Paradise Beverages general manager of marketing and new product development, said the company worked hard to perfect the beer.

“Moli is made in the same way as Fiji Gold, but its refreshing, smooth and zesty flavour stands on its own as the perfect celebration for all life’s savoured moments.

“We believe the flavour of Fiji Gold Moli will appeal to traditional Fiji Gold drinkers and prove a winner with drinkers who wouldn’t usually consider a beer. Plus, because it’s made in the same way as Fiji Gold, it’s also got the benefit of being lower in calories than other lagers.”

Paradise Beverages was purchased by Coca-Cola Amatil in 2012 and has since undergone a FJD 60 million ($28.1 million) capital investment and capability programme.",Paradise Beverages releases Fiji Gold Moli lemon-infused beer

Starkist said the range’s packaging features a tear-open and no-drain design, making it easy to enjoy the products from the pouch or added to a simple meal.

Andy Mecs, vice president of marketing and innovation at Starkist Co, said: “Starkist is constantly driving innovation when it comes to new flavour profiles. By introducing bold seasonings to our premium tuna, our consumers enjoy the health benefits of seafood with a kick of flavour.

The expansion includes additional bacon processing and slicing capacities, bacon equipment upgrades and new slicing equipment. It is expected the upgrades will be completed by 2019, creating 25 new jobs.

Built in 1976, the Ottumwa facility produces more than 1 billion pounds of fresh pork and bacon products per year.

Last year, JBS appointed former Kraft-Heinz executive Thomas Lopez to lead Plumrose.

“Today’s announcement demonstrates our continued commitment to the Ottumwa community and reinforces our strategy to grow our business through key customer partnerships,” he said.

“This significant investment will create more opportunities for local producers, strengthen our leading portfolio of high-quality, value-added pork products, and support the growth aspirations of key customers.”

"Huhtamaki has developed a new line of paper straws, including several size variants in addition to the standard 7.3mm diameter version.","February 12, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Huhtamaki-paper-straws.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/huhtamaki-launches-line-of-paper-straws-invests-to-increase-output/,"Huhtamaki has developed a new line of paper straws after having invested in new, purpose-built machinery.

The straws, which are available in various sizes, are made of fibre from sustainably managed forests and 100% of the paper used in the products and in their wrapping is certified by the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC).

Finland-headquartered Huhtamaki said the straws have been tested and certified for food safety in Europe, China and the US.

Last year, the European Union agreed to ban a range of items made from plastic as of 2021, including straws, cutlery, cups, drink stirrers, and sticks for balloons.

Huhtamaki is now expanding its paper straw manufacturing capacity into “key markets across Europe and globally”.

Neal McCone, of Huhtamaki’s foodservice Europe-Asia-Oceania business segment, said: “Our paper straws are crafted to be strong, reliable and functional. We have invested in new, purpose-built machinery to deliver premium product quality. We are confident that we can offer paper straws that are durable and superior in performance compared to the current market offering. Our straws are also both odour and taint free.

“In addition to new machines, we have also invested into new manufacturing setups for paper straws. We look forward to the opportunity to offer a sustainable choice, grow the market and be the leading supplier. With our initial output, we are serving McDonald’s in the UK and across Europe as one of their main suppliers.”

The launch comes after a range of companies – including Coca-Cola Amatil, McDonald’s, Diageo and Pernod Ricard – have pledged to reduce or eliminate their use of plastic straws.

Companies are responding to heightened consumer concerns about the impact of non-biodegradable plastic on the environment and oceans.","Huhtamaki launches line of paper straws, invests to boost output"
"Danone will begin incorporating 'smart caps' into its Spanish mineral water brand Font Vella, allowing consumers to track their levels of hydration.","February 12, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-130.png?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/danone-adds-hydration-coaching-cap-to-font-vella-bottled-water/,"Danone will begin incorporating ‘smart caps’ into its Spanish mineral water brand Font Vella, allowing consumers to track their levels of hydration.

Dubbed Coach2O, the widget will monitors consumers’ water intake and “coach them towards adequate hydration”, Danone said.

It works by clipping onto the existing bottle cap (ensuring no contact between the water and the device) and recording the volume of water taken in by the consumer. It can also remind people to drink using a discreet series of ‘blinks’ – and comes complete with an accompanying app that allows consumers to set daily hydration goals and adjust the fitting to their individual requirements.

The company has developed the devices in partnership with Water.io – the innovative smart packaging company whose bottle cap technology – as co-founder Yoav Hoshen told FoodBev in 2015 – has the ability to turn any ordinary bottle ‘smart’.

The start-up previously worked with packaging company Visy to make its bottle caps available in Australia and New Zealand – but Danone’s latest usage represents a real coup.

It is particularly on-trend given the growing inclination of consumers to reuse and refill plastic water bottles.

Bruno Dasque, vice-president research and innovation for Danone Waters, said: “Over the years, our scientific teams have developed a deep understanding of the science of hydration. Now, with our open innovation capabilities, we can leverage digital solutions to bring all this knowledge to those who need it most: our consumers, through personalised solutions.”

The European Food Safety Authority recommends a daily intake of 2.5 litres of water for men and 2 litres of water for women – through either the food they eat or they drinks they consume – including around 70-80% sought from beverages.

Kinvara Carey, general manager for the UK’s National Hydration Council, said: “With the current debates continuing around sugar and the health of the nation, now is the time to challenge ourselves and consider how we can do more to encourage healthy hydration habits.

“Although most drinks will hydrate you, water is one of the healthiest ways to hydrate as it contains no calories or sugar. There is so much choice when it comes to water, with a range of high-quality naturally sourced still and sparkling waters as well as tap water at home, or carried in a reusable bottle.”

Although there has been criticism of hydration in the past, with some nutritionists arguing that the concept is over-emphasised, there is growing evidence to suggest that consumers are channelling their health kick towards water and cutting back on soda.

In 2017, sales of bottled water overtook carbonated soft drinks in the US for the first time – and last year, food and drinks consultancy Zenith Global predicted that the same would be true on a global basis for the whole of 2018.

This was “all the more remarkable” because other soft drink categories were still growing, according to Zenith chairman Richard Hall.",Danone adds 'hydration coaching' cap to Font Vella bottled water

The Dutch brewer said it has played matchmaker to the beer and Lagunitas to modernise the “iconic” brown ale for release in March 2019.

Amy Tay, brand director for Newcastle Brown Ale, said: “Working together with our friends at Lagunitas Brewing Company, we’ve created an uncommonly balanced brown ale, brewed through a unique blend of pale and roasted malts.

“The result is a smooth, crisp, slightly roasty beer, complete with a delicious hoppy twist that’s not too bitter, not too sweet, and altogether uncommon.”

She added: “Whether you’re a super fan of Newcastle Brown Ale, or just an enthusiast of great craft beer, you’re going to love cracking open a bottle of the new brew and enjoying a silky-smooth, flavourful experience.”

As part of the launch, Newcastle Brown Ale will select random Facebook followers and gift them with exclusive swag, encouraging them to taste the new beer and share the word with their friends.

The brand will also invest in additional sampling opportunities at events and festivals in select cities from April to September.

In 2017, Heineken bought out the remaining shares in California’s Lagunitas Brewing Company, two years after acquiring a 50% stake.

Held in conjunction with ISM, the leading trade fair for sweets and snacks, ProSweets’ largest element is traditionally the machines and equipment section and this was also the case at this year’s show, as over 300 exhibitors showcased their solutions for the sweets and snacks industry.

The production of tailored shapes and packaging is particularly important within the sweets and snacks industry, and this was reflected by the range of equipment at the show. Visitors were able to observe the production of attention-grabbing labels and packaging, the latest hot sealing technologies and discover a range of biodegradable packing materials.

One of the main themes at this year’s ProSweets Cologne was the digital networking of systems, and how this is improving efficiency, hygiene and operating costs. Confectionery machines equipped with technology such as sensors provide substantial amounts of data to operators – data which can help operators save resources, time and money.

Beyond machinery, the key themes for this year’s show included the reduction of sugar, fat and salt; the increased importance of clean label and natural ingredients; as well as the need to tailor and reformulate recipes to cater to the needs of vegetarian and vegan consumers.

A number of talks, tours and presentations attracted large audiences as expert speakers addressed topics such as sustainable packaging, reformulation and the possibilities offered by augmented and virtual reality.

Trade visitors were able to learn how to create brands with the help of augmented reality and create new, extended product experiences for consumers. The capabilities of virtual reality were also showcased through the example of a virtual supermarket.

Anne Schumacher, nutrition and nutrition technology vice-president at Koelnmesse, said: “For the suppliers of the sweets industry, ProSweets Cologne is the central, international business platform.

“With new customising technologies, innovative and sustainable packing solutions as well as new developments regarding digital networking in the production sector, the industry demonstrated that it is on the pulse of time.

“The trade’s interest in the fair has also significantly increased. The value chain is growing more closely together as a result. The interplay ISM and ProSweets Cologne is a unique constellation and offers incomparable synergies.”

Meanwhile at ISM, a wide range of finished products were on show, with many brands and manufacturers expressing that the consumer desire for healthy and sustainably-sourced products was a primary concern.

Over 1,650 suppliers from 76 countries, 87% of which came from outside Germany, exhibited their latest products and innovations at this year’s show.

Ruby chocolate – the fourth type of chocolate after milk, dark and white – was one of the main attractions at ISM. Chocolatier Barry Callebaut, the developer of the chocolate, devoted its stand to the flavour and received a great deal of interest from visitors, while chocolate brands including Libeert, Heilemann and Witor’s showcased ruby chocolate products at the show.

 Meanwhile, products made with vegetable-based proteins, natural ingredients and sustainably-grown raw materials were among the most important offerings on show at the fair.

Gerald Böse, president and CEO of Koelnmesse, said: “Once again in these difficult times, ISM confirmed its international standing as the industry’s most important business platform once again in 2019.

“Not only do the stable, high-key figures corroborate this, but also the high level of quality of the exhibitors and visitors.”","Review: Sustainable, digital and vegan trends at ISM/ProSweets"

Net sales for 2018 were $10.77 billion – down 2.1% compared to the year before – while underlying EBITDA fell by 1.7% from $2.5 billion to $2.45 billion.

For the final quarter of last year, sales were 6.2% weaker at $2.42 billion but underlying EBITDA grew 1.4% to $487.7 million.

The weaker results – relative to 2017 – were motivated in part by a 1.9% reduction in global volumes.

Molson Coors chief executive officer Mark Hunter said: “We accomplished much in 2018, delivering strong free cash flow and meeting our deleverage commitments, restoring underlying EBITDA growth in the quarter and second half, premiumising our portfolio across regions including launching Truss, our Canadian cannabis beverage JV, scaling volume and profitability in our fast growing International business and continuing to strengthen our European business.

“Through the year we further scaled our cost saving programme, which insulated us in part from the effects of weaker industry demand in North America, higher than anticipated input inflationary pressures and challenges associated with the implementation of our US brewery supply chain system.

“We enter 2019 with a US commercial plan focused on mix and share improvement that is fully resourced and showing early signs of impact against Coors Light, a commercial strategy that is working in Europe and International, and continually improving commercial trends in Canada. We are focused on further strong free cash flow delivery and deleverage supported by more than $200 million of cost savings in 2019 and further $450 million across 2020-2022.”

Following a multi-million-dollar investment, the facility will now produce Vega yogurt alternatives and nutritional powders, as well as Silk yogurt alternatives and So Delicious Dairy Free yogurt alternatives and dairy-free cheese shreds.

Danone is responding to a growing consumer demand for plant-based dairy alternatives. Last year, the company revealed plans to triple the size of its plant-based business by 2025 by combining its position in the dairy industry with the high plant-based growth potential.

The firm said that that flexitarians now account for “one-third of the total population in the US”.

Mariano Lozano, CEO of Danone North America, said: “As flexitarian eating patterns continue to evolve and grow in popularity, plant-based food options present an opportunity to bring new choices throughout the grocery store.

“Dairy-free is different than non-dairy – dairy-free options must be produced in a facility that is solely dedicated to plant-based food production. As consumers continue to seek out more dairy-free options, having a facility that meets this standard gives us an opportunity to deliver on their growing demand and high expectations.”

Chad Stone, plant director at Danone North America’s DuBois facility, added: “We’re proud to be a part of the DuBois community where we are now making several of our beloved plant-based products for our Silk, So Delicious Dairy Free and Vega brands.

“Our expertise in plant-based foods is made possible by the dedication of people in the facilities like DuBois where we focus on production to support this important area of growth.”

He added: “Many people who enjoy our products look for plant-based options because they are interested in lessening their impact on the environment through diet.

“Recognising this is a priority for the people we serve, we are committed to continuously improving our environmental practices to ensure they are best in class. We have several projects underway including minimising waste, reducing electricity consumption by converting to LED lighting across all areas of the DuBois facility and creating efficiencies for water use in our cleaning processes.”",Danone expands US facility to grow plant-based food output

Givaudan claims that these strengthened capabilities will allow it to effectively satisfy growing demand from customers in the food and beverage and health care segments in the region.

This facility is also Givaudan’s first ever zero liquid discharge site, as the plant will ensure that all wastewater produced at the factory is purified and recycled at the end of the treatment cycle.

The investment has bolstered the efficiency of Kara’s Lanham line, where the brand produces a range of floured baps and seeded deli rolls.

In particular, the investment has focused on upgrading the Lanham Proofer, and the funds have paid for the replacement of the proofer enclosure, air conditioning system and hydraulic drive pack.

Kara claims that the upgraded equipment will improve quality and consistency, as well as reduce lost time and help the brand meet efficient production standards.

The company said it would invest further funds into the site in future to improve its main bakery ventilation systems and one of three spiral freezers, further increasing production capacity at the facility.

Robin Mountain, business unit director at Kara, said: “This investment marks the beginning of a really exciting time for us at Kara and it’s fantastic to see the completion of a replacement Lanham plant proofer.

Ingo Müller, CEO of the DMK Group, said: “The conversion has enabled us to fulfil the requirements for further strategic alignment between the DMK Group and the Humana brand.

“The investment will allow us to meet the requirements of state-of-the-art baby food production in the future too, both in terms of our own production capacity and our customers’ quality, sustainability and flexibility requirements.

“The investment in Strückhausen is also a clear commitment to the northwest region for us, where we are creating jobs for people in structurally weak, rural areas.

“The DMK Group makes its contribution to the continued economic development of the region in terms of its plants in Strückhausen, Edewecht, Zeven and the administration location in Bremen, which overall provide more than 2,500 jobs.”

The new site will also allow DMK to increase production of the resealable, protective baby formula packs used for its myHumana brand.

COO of DMK’s Baby food division, Stefan Eckert, added: “This [new plant] paves the way for further growth. Since October 2018, the myHumana Pack has been available for our Humana mothers on the shelves in Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Poland.

The acquisition will see Tyson acquire four poultry processing facilities in Thailand, one processing facility in the Netherlands and one processing facility in the United Kingdom.

The newly-acquired poultry operations in Thailand include a feed mill, hatchery, breeder farms and contract growing operations which supply birds to the four processing facilities. These four plants produce a wide range of fresh and frozen, value-added poultry products for retail and foodservice customers throughout Asia and other export markets such as Europe.

Meanwhile, the processing locations in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom process a wide range of poultry products, and both facilities are supported by in-house innovation capabilities to support and accelerate the development of new value-added processed poultry products.

Tyson claims that this deal builds on the company’s growth strategy to expand its value-added protein offerings in international markets.

As part of this strategy, Tyson acquired meat product manufacturer Keystone Foods from Marfrig, another Brazilian meat producer, for $2.16 billion in August 2018.

Noel White, president and CEO of Tyson Foods, said: “As noted when we acquired Keystone Foods on November 30, we believe some of our biggest growth opportunities are in value-added foods and international markets.

“In addition to domestic benefits, the Keystone acquisition provided us with a scalable production platform in the Asian poultry market.

“The acquisition of these BRF facilities will help complement and strengthen our presence in Thailand, and provide new capabilities in Europe, enhancing our ability to serve growing global demand for value-added protein.”

Donnie King, group president of International for Tyson Foods, said: “It’s estimated that approximately 90% of global protein consumption growth will occur outside the United States, with 60% of the volume growth coming from Asia over the next five years.

“Increasing our international footprint with in-country operations and export capabilities will help Tyson Foods strategically access new markets and better serve the growing global demand for our value-added protein.”",Tyson to acquire BRF's Thai and European units for $340m

Pernod Ricard – which owns a diverse range of spirits such as Absolut, Martell and Chivas Regal – recorded net sales of €2.79 billion for the quarter, up from the €2.71 billion figure recorded in the same period last year.

Net sales in Asia/Rest of the World increased 7.4% to €1.18 billion, partially driven by a boost in the build-up to Chinese New Year and continued growth in India.

Sales in the Americas also increased 3.1% to €753 million, which the company partially attributed to consistent long-term investment, though net sales in Europe did fall 2% to €863 million, as growth in Eastern Europe was offset by weaker performance in Western Europe.

Pernod Ricard did not report its operating profit or net income for the second quarter of the year, but over the first half of the year, the company reported operating profit of €1.65 billion, a 10.7% year-on-year rise, though the company’s net profit did fall to €1.03 billion in the same period, a fall of 11.2% when compared to the same period last year.

The company’s organic sales grew 10% over the half-year period, with the Martell (23%), Royal Salute (15%) and Perrier-Jouët (12%) all performing particularly strongly.

However, despite the strong performance its Strategic International Brands portfolio, the company’s Strategic Wines unit recorded an organic sales decline of 8%, following the implementation of value strategy and a comparative sales decrease for its Campo Viejo wine, which performed well above expectations in H1 2018.

Pernod Ricard also warned that H2 growth is expected to moderate due to sustainable growth management of the Martell brand, wholesaler inventory optimisation in the US and a commercial dispute in France and Germany.

The company also announced a cost-saving plan, aiming to save an additional €100 million by 2021 and the company said it aims to achieve 4% to 7% annual organic sales growth over the same period.

Alexandre Ricard, Pernod Ricard’s chairman and CEO, said: “H1 FY19, the first semester of our new Transform & Accelerate 3-year plan, was very strong.

“While enhanced by phasing, it confirms the acceleration of our growth, resulting from our long-term investment strategy. For full year FY19, in an environment that remains uncertain, we aim to continue dynamic and diversified growth across our regions and brands.

“By the end of June 2019, we will have completed our operational excellence plan announced in 2016, delivering €200m of P&L savings one year ahead of plan.

“We are increasing our guidance for FY19 organic growth in Profit from Recurring Operations to between +6% and +8%.

Cahillane continues.

Net sales for the year to 30 December were $13.55 billion – up from $12.85 billion last year – while operating profit rose almost 23% to reach $1.71 billion. For the fourth quarter, net sales grew to $3.32 billion, though there was a fall in operating profit, down to $326 million.

The strong performance continues the recovery that Kellogg has made since Steven Cahillane replaced John Bryant in October 2017.

Two years ago, the company had just rounded off 2016 with a disappointing fourth quarter that returned $98 million in operating profit from total quarterly sales of $3.1 billion, having just registered the 14th of what would become 16 consecutive quarters of year-on-year decline in net sales.

Cahillane took on the position of CEO the following October, meaning 2018 was his first full year in charge; the Battle Creek-based firm has recorded growth in every quarter since.

Commenting on Kellogg’s latest results, Cahillane said: “2018 was an important year for us, in which we pivoted to growth after successfully reducing our cost structure in recent years.

“We launched Deploy for Growth, a strategy that gives us clarity on priorities, and has us taking decisive actions to return our company to sustainable top-line growth.

“We still have a lot of work to do, but we have made great strides toward reshaping our portfolio toward growth, revitalising key brands, and developing capabilities. Our stabilisation of a declining net sales trend and our improved in-market performance around the world are clear signs of this progress. This investment and progress will be evident again in 2019, setting us on a path for sustainable, profitable growth over time.”

In particular, full-year profit grew 23% on the back of lower restructuring charges and the positive impact seen from Kellogg’s acquisition of protein bar brand Rxbar in October 2017 and the consolidation of Nigerian distributor Multipro in May 2018.

Decline in Kellogg’s US snacks and morning foods divisions was offset by robust growth in the ‘North America other’ segment, which includes Rxbar as well as US frozen foods, Kashi, and Kellogg’s Canadian business.

Kellogg’s Asia-Pacific unit increased sales by more than 60% in spite of adverse currency translation, while the company’s business in Europe recorded a near-5% increase in sales.",Kellogg continues its recovery as full-year sales reach $13.5bn

Cargill seeks to address key sustainability challenges for the harvesting and cultivation of red seaweed through a new programme.,"February 08, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cargill.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/cargill-targets-sustainable-red-seaweed-through-new-initiative/,"Cargill seeks to address key sustainability challenges for the harvesting and cultivation of red seaweed through a new programme.

Called the Red Seaweed Promise, the initiative sees Cargill aim to enhance producer livelihoods and conserve the marine environment.

Cargill said the programme also answers food industry and consumer needs for more sustainable food ingredients, with a commitment to source 60% sustainable red seaweed by 2025.

Red seaweed is the raw material needed to produce carrageenan, a texturiser used in applications such as dairy, confectionery and personal care products.

Sebastien Jan, Cargill seaweed strategic sourcing project manager, said: “Red seaweed production is critical to the prosperity of approximately 1 million producers and their communities.

“Today, these producers face multiple challenges, from climate change and extreme weather events to inefficient farming and harvesting practices, which have a significant impact on the quality of red seaweed.

“The Red Seaweed Promise supports producers’ prosperity by providing the training, coaching and tools producers need to adopt environmental and safe production best practices, while committing to sustainable marine and coastal ecosystems.”

Cargill said the move leverages its partnerships with producers and suppliers to increase traceability and transparency in the supply chain for its customers.

Proforest, a non-profit group offering consultancy services in sustainable sourcing of natural resources, supported the company in the definition of an industry standard evaluation tool and conducted verifications in the regions where Cargill sources red seaweed. Results are used to set region-specific continuous improvement plans, focusing efforts on four priority areas: empowering seaweed producers, improving production and harvest practices, supporting sourcing communities, and strengthening partnerships.

Cargill sustainability manager James Ede said: “We are committed to making a positive impact and securing sustainably sourced red seaweed for our customers. To ensure we are following international sustainability priorities, the programme supports the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

“The Red Seaweed Promise supports our customers’ sustainability commitments and provides assurance to consumers who are increasingly seeking sustainably sourced products.”

In 2017, Cargill developed a premium texturiser for gelled dairy desserts based on a new type of carrageenan extract. Called Satiagel ADG 0220 Seabrid, the product is derived using technology from 100% cultivated seaweed.",Cargill targets sustainable red seaweed through new initiative

Adding to this, Kirin Group set out to reduce the weight of PET bottles in order to promote the sustainability of raw materials. The company said they are also looking into biodegradable options such as non-edible plants, lowering the reliance on petroleum resources. This will then further reduce environmental impacts.

In order to reconnect with the principles of Carlsberg’s founder, JC Jacobsen, Carlsberg said it has enhanced every aspect of its beer – including the choice of ingredients through to the brewing process – in order to create “its best-ever quality beer”.

The brew will be available as of 1 March, supported by a multi-million-pound investment and new visual identity, which aims to increase brand quality perceptions. The trade launch will be supported by the brand’s most ambitious, integrated consumer marketing campaign to date, running throughout 2019.

Carlsberg Danish Pilsner remains at 3.8% ABV and retains the light qualities of its predecessor but has been “rebrewed from head to hop to deliver a smoother, fuller mouth-feel and a perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness”, the brewer said.

Liam Newton, Carlsberg UK vice president marketing, said: “In launching our new, perfectly balanced Carlsberg Danish Pilsner, we’re toasting the brewing passion of our founder JC Jacobsen and his legacy of pursuing better, which started over 170 years ago.

“Some of the most popular and recognisable beers, like Carlsberg Danish Pilsner, will continue to represent the biggest segment in UK beer in five years’ time and therefore remains crucial to the health of the beer category overall. We’re firm believers in people drinking better beer, and people want better beer, so why wouldn’t we respond to this consumer need?

“In recent years we have reinvigorated our premium Carlsberg Expørt and we’re now committed to enhancing every aspect of the Carlsberg Danish Pilsner drinking experience, ultimately encouraging the trade and beer drinkers to re-appraise our brand.”

Carlsberg UK master brewer Bhavya Mandanna added: “Our new pilsner has a fuller body and a perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness made possible through modifications to our brewing process and the addition of bittering hops in the brewhouse.

“Aroma hops with citrus and floral top notes give a greater depth of flavour whilst maintaining the light and refreshing qualities of Carlsberg. The result is a smooth, perfectly balanced, Danish Pilsner.”

Carlsberg aims to elevate the consumer drinking experience with a new stemmed glass featuring a tapered top as well as upgraded bottle caps, which are said to preserve the freshness and life of the beer.

Meanwhile, cans will feature Snap Pack glue technology – winner of best CSR/sustainability initiative at World Beverage Innovation Awards 2018 – in a move to reduce plastic usage.

‘Greener Green’ ink will also be incorporated in bottle labels and outer packaging to improve packaging recyclability.

Last month, Asahi launched the Asahi Group Philosophy, a new initiative which sets out to “contribute to a sustainable society”.

In a move to enter new categories such as cask ale and cider, Asahi last month acquired the entire beer, cider, soft drinks and distribution business of the UK’s Fuller, Smith & Turner for a value of £250 million.

The two companies agreed to arrangements that will see beers from across the Asahi portfolio sold in Fuller’s-owned pubs and tenanted outlets. Fuller’s will carry its former brands, alongside the existing Asahi Europe portfolio, across its pubs and hotels.

Three flavours will be available in the new Kokoro Gin Liqueurs range: Cherry blossom, blueberry and lemongrass, yuzu and ginger.

The launch of the three flavours celebrates the coming of spring in Japan, as well as the famous cherry blossom viewing season known as Hanami.

Each flavour features a different design on the bottle, which together forms a triptych of Mount Bandai in Japan.

The illustrations were painted by Koshu, a calligrapher who also painted the Kokoro Hirigana logo on the front of the bottle.

James Nicol, Kokoro Founder, said: “We’re delighted to be adding these exciting Japanese liqueurs to the Kokoro family. We’ve spent the last two years developing the range using authentic, natural Japanese ingredients.

“We’re proud that our family business is continuing to support the preservation of the forest in Japan where the sansho berries grow and which are at the heart of our gin.

“We will be giving 10% from the sale of every bottle of Kokoro Gin and the Kokoro Liqueurs to help preserve the forest which is close to my family’s heart.”

Start-up Yumello aims to bring the vibrant flavours of the Atlas Mountains to the kitchens of Britain with its new range of nut butters.,"February 06, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Yumello.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/yumello-releases-range-of-nut-butters-created-with-argan-oil/,"Start-up Yumello aims to bring the vibrant flavours of the Atlas Mountains to the kitchens of Britain with its new range of nut butters.

Founders Esther and Omar Elhajji met while in Omar’s home of the Atlas Mountains. Esther travelled to Morocco from Barcelona to volunteer with a business harnessing the powers of argan oil for its cosmetic and nutritional qualities.

Unlike other nut butter producers which use palm oil, Yumello creates its products from argan oil, a product sourced from the kernels of the argania spinosa tree (a species native to Morocco).

Esther said: “I have always loved discovering new cultures, a friend had been on a trekking trip in the Atlas Mountains and told me that Berber villages are unlike anything we had experienced – the beautiful landscapes, the welcoming people and incredible food. I did some research and found out about the intriguing argan oil cooperatives – providing jobs for hundreds of women and empowering them both economically and socially.

“I wanted to be part of that and hopped on a plane direct to volunteer with an argan oil co-operative entirely run by women, where Omar was helping to make the production more efficient.”

Yumello’s products can be found in Harvey Nichols, Revital, Eat 17, Not on the High Street, The Grocery, Panzer’s Deli and in cafés and delis around the UK.

The 170g jars are available with a recommended retail price of £2.85 or £4.95.",Yumello releases range of nut butters created with argan oil

Meanwhile, Nescafé Cold Whipped Latte is said to deliver a latte texture that consumers expect from a coffee-shop experience. Available in a 10oz bottle in a coffee or French vanilla variant, the product retails for $2.49.

Nestlé said the ready-to-drink beverages give coffee fans “elevated yet convenient ways to enjoy coffee”. Both are now available in the US.

With no preservatives added, the refrigerated beverage has been created to meet a need for a better-for-you oat milk, Mooala said.

Jeff Richards, Mooala founder and CEO, said: “Consumers are increasingly migrating to the plant-based lifestyle to eat more mindfully, and oat milk is quickly becoming a mainstream favourite due to its versatility.

“However, most oat milks on the market are over-processed and full of sugary carbs. We wanted to offer consumers an organic and better-for-you option, so we introduced Mooala organic coconut oat milk. It’s a creamy and delicious gamechanger with zero grams of sugar per serving for people looking to keep up with their wellness goals.”

The price of wine in the UK has increased as the country’s inflationary rise in wine duty came into effect on 1 February.,"February 04, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/glass-1396260.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/uk-tax-hike-on-wine-kicks-off-as-wsta-warns-of-stifled-growth/,"The price of wine in the UK has increased as the country’s inflationary rise in wine duty came into effect on 1 February.

Wine was singled out by Chancellor Philip Hammond during the UK’s 2018 Autumn Budget, while other alcohol products saw a duty freeze in a move to support the country’s pubs.

As a result of the 3.1% inflationary rise, the price of a bottle of wine has gone up by £0.07, sparkling wine by £0.09 and an average priced bottle of fortified wine by £0.09. This does not include VAT which would add a further 20% to the wine duty rise.

The Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) warned that the increase in wine duty “will stifle growth of the flourishing English wine industry” and “stifle business’s ability to invest and grow”.

The association added that if the UK crashes out of the European Union (EU) without a Brexit deal, tariffs on EU wines alongside the duty increase “would add an extra £0.20” to the price of a bottle of wine.

Miles Beale, WSTA chief executive, said: “As of today, the duty rate on still wine has increased by £0.07 to £2.23, and on sparkling by £0.09 to £2.86. This is as a result of the Chancellor singling out wine for an unfair duty increase in last October’s Budget.

“This comes at a particularly bad time for the UK wine industry – the threat of a no-deal Brexit is still on the table with the Government continuing to refuse to rule out leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March. If this happens and the UK does leave without a deal, tariffs on wine from the EU will apply, meaning wine prices will rise by £0.20 per bottle for still wine and £0.37 for sparkling wine.

“These price rises are a direct result of the Government’s refusal to back the UK’s wine industry – which supports 190,000 UK jobs – and its active decision to pass on a punishing duty rise; and the Government’s inability to resolve the UK’s trading relationship with the EU, from where over half our wine is sourced.

“The WSTA has been consistent in calling for support for the wine industry and for politicians to say #NoToNoDeal. These price rises were entirely avoidable and bitterly disappointing.”",UK tax hike on wine kicks off as WSTA warns of ‘stifled growth’

Having initially bought a 29% stake in the ingredients maker in 2013, DSM said it has now settled a shareholder dispute to purchase an additional 46%.

The remaining 25% of shares in Andre Pectin will continue to be held by the Shandong Andre Group. DSM said it will closely work with Andre Group to improve the operational performance of Andre Pectin, ensuring reliable supply through its global sales network of pectin, while securing compliance with DSM’s own safety, health and sustainability standards.

Located in Yantai, Shandong Province, Andre Pectin is said to be “Asia’s largest producer of apple and citrus pectin”, hydrocolloids providing texture solutions for food and beverages. With 410 employees, DSM drew attention to the company’s “strong organic sales and profit growth track record”.

The deal expands DSM’s hydrocolloid portfolio, complementing its stakes in DSM Zhongken Biotechnology and DSM Rainbow (Inner Mongolia) Biotechnology.

Hydrocolloids are thickeners and stabilisers that dissolve, disperse or swell in water to provide a range of functionalities, including gelling, texture, mouthfeel, viscosity and suspension.

According to DSM, demand for hydrocolloids is driven by three underlying consumer trends: the quest for convenient foods and beverages, consumers’ increasing demand for dairy and plant-based protein drinks, and a move towards clean labelling.

It is expected the transaction will close in the first or second quarter of 2019.

The announcement comes a week after DSM revealed plans to create a joint venture with Chinese firm Nenter & Co to make vitamin E.",DSM acquires majority stake in Andre Pectin for 150m euros

"UK beverage brand Water Works has expanded its line of tree sap waters with a new aloe-coco variant, as well as a line of carton-packed spring waters.","February 06, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WWFP_duuo.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/water-works-debuts-aloe-coco-combo-and-carton-packed-spring-water/,"UK beverage brand Water Works has expanded its line of tree sap waters with a new aloe coco variant, and has also launched a line of carton-packed spring waters as pressure on plastic packaging continues to mount.

The better-for-you brand, which already produces cactus and watermelon water, is combining “the hydrating benefits of coconut water and the soothing effects of aloe vera” in its new drink.

It will aim the AloeCoco water at front-of-store chillers but, as the drinks are aseptically packed in 330ml Tetra Pak cartons, they can be stored ambient.

Ashil Vaghela, creator and co-founder of Water Works, told FoodBev: “We opted for a coconut water from the Philippines, which has a subtle yet pleasant flavour when compared to what is commonly available from Thailand. We fortified this with pulp-free aloe vera to create this tasty and nourishing functional beverage which we feel sits well within the range.”

The brand is also responding to consumer pressure over plastic waste by launching a natural spring water in carton packaging, available in two sizes: 330ml and 1 litre.

“By choosing to fill Tetra Pak cartons instead of bottles or cans, we are able to send multiple times more empty units in one truck,” Vaghela continued. “This is because cartons can be sent flat-packed to take up less space, whereas bottles and cans have to be sent fully formed.

“Whereas other brands fill abroad and then ship their water over to the UK, we source local spring water, which helps us to further minimise our impact on climate change. By using a cap which is derived from sugarcane, we have further increased the content of renewable materials in our packaging.

Beyond the improvement in environmental performance versus other formats, the cartons also help keep the water crisp and fresh, since the packaging effectively blocks out light and air.

Vaghela founded the Water Works brand in 2017 along with business partner Khaled el Yafi, who is also the founder of The Berry Company, which makes a line in juices and teas.

The waters are positioned as healthier alternatives to sugary soft drinks, inspired by the rise in alternative waters with similar functional and hydration benefits to coconut water.

“We drew inspiration from the US, which is the pioneering market for alternative waters and functional beverages,” Vaghela said.

As well as adding to the plant-derived water range with the new aloe and coconut combination, Water Works’ latest carton-packed spring waters show that the brand is tuned in to consumer opinion: pressure on plastic has mounted in the face of uncontrollable levels of post-consumer waste, and now the prospect of government intervention is growing.

The European Union (EU) has banned single-use plastics from 2021 and the UK government has opted to introduce a tax on them, which will come into effect a year later.

Recyclable formats, like beverage cartons, have benefited enormously as a result.",Water Works debuts aloe-coco combo and cartoned spring water

Barrett said: “For us to continue the growth rate we believe we are capable of, it was time to find an equity partner. But we didn’t want just any equity partner. We wanted someone who understood our business, our culture and our goals.

“We found that partner right in our back yard. Constellation shares our love of western NY and they are also committed to the agricultural roots that are so important to Black Button.

For the year ended 31 December, the grain trader posted revenues of $64.34 billion. Adjusted operating profit rose 25.9% to $3.36 billion.

The company’s largest segment, origination, recorded a 3.9% increase in revenues for the year but struggled in the fourth quarter. In the final three months of the year, the unit’s adjusted operating profit dipped 29.9% to $183 million despite increased exports of corn and soybeans to markets outside of China.

In the firm’s nutrition unit, which includes Wild Flavors & Specialty Ingredients, both full-year revenues and operating profit were up as the firm benefitted from a strong demand for lecithin.

ADM CEO Juan Luciano said: “Our team executed well, delivering strong year-over-year profit growth in the fourth quarter. Looking back on the full year, the team did a great job focusing on the items we could control, as we continued innovating to serve customer needs and advancing our strategic priorities.

“Our effective management through complicated and rapidly changing trade, geopolitical and market conditions helped deliver an impressively strong 2018 that included solid profit growth, improved returns on invested capital and higher cash flows.

“We will continue working to deliver shareholder value in 2019 by vigorously executing our strategy, including aggressively working to improve execution in select businesses, accelerating our readiness efforts to deliver increasing value, and harvesting the contributions from our acquisitions and organic growth investments. By continuing to pull the levers under our control, we are positioning ourselves to grow profits and returns in 2019 and beyond.”

Last year, ADM restructured its business into four segments to give it greater capacity to differentiate its product portfolio, drive innovation and evolve to meet changing consumer demands.

The firm also announced partnerships with Cargill, creating Grainbridge, a new technology joint venture in North America, and a soybean business in Egypt.",ADM sees full-year revenues rise in three of four business units

Carlsberg – which owns beer brands such as Tuborg, Holsten and Birrell – recorded net revenues of DKK 62.5 billion ($9.53 billion) for the full year, the first time the company’s sales have risen in the last three years.

The company partially attributed the performance to the unusually warm weather in Western Europe and the boost provided by the 2018 World Cup, which led to a net revenue rise of 3% and sales volume growth of 3.6% in the region over the year.

Full-year operating profit also increased by 5.1% to DKK 9,32 billion ($1.42 billion), as profits rose 15.8% in Asia, 11.3% in Eastern Europe and 7% in Western Europe.

Sales volumes grew by 19% in India and by 15% in China, while revenue in Russia grew 3%, also boosted by warm weather and the World Cup.

Craft beer is proving an increasingly popular beverage choice for many consumers, and the company’s craft & speciality portfolio delivered growth of 26%, with international speciality brands Grimbergen and 1664 Blanc and craft brands such as Brooklyn performing strongly.

In 2018, Carlsberg launched Birell as the Group’s ‘first global alcohol-free drink’, and Carlsberg’s overall alcohol-free beer portfolio experienced 33% growth in Western Europe, while the company’s Baltika 0 brand grew by 35% in Russia.

Carlsberg’s core beer brands also experienced growth, as Tuborg sales rose 10%, supported by good growth in China, India and Western Europe, while global Carlsberg sales volumes grew 5%.

Carlsberg CEO Cees ’t Hart said: “We delivered a strong set of results for 2018. In line with our ambitions for SAIL’22, we accelerated top-line growth, improved margins, delivered a strong cash flow and reduced debt even further.

“At the same time, we invested significant resources in our brands and activities, and we continue to target top-line growth and profit improvement in the coming years.”

Over the course of the year, Carlsberg made a number of significant investments to boost its operations. This included the purchase of a 28.5% stake in Super Bock Group owner Viacer, the acquisition of a majority stake in Cambodian brewer Cambrew Limited and the full acquisition of Olympic Brewery, Greece’s second-largest brewer.

The company also attempted to boost its sustainability commitments by removing the plastic rings which connect multi-packs of its beer, replacing them with glue, in a move which the company claimed would “reduce plastic waste globally by more than 1,200 tonnes a year”.",Carlsberg revenues boosted by warm weather and World Cup

The deal sees Burton’s expand its capabilities in the premium confectionery segment. Dorset-based Thomas Fudge’s makes a range of flatbreads, biscuits for cheese, wafers, florentines and flapjacks.

Burton’s – the owner brands such as Maryland Cookies, Wagon Wheels and Jammie Dodgers – currently has an agreement with Mondelēz International to bake products for its Cadbury brand.

He added: “Thomas Fudge’s is a great business with a fantastic portfolio of premium products and baking expertise handed down through generations.

“The bakery provides a hugely complementary production capability to Burton’s own bakeries, extending into the more premium and artisanal end of the category with their branded, retailer brand and Marmite products baked under licence.

“We are excited about the opportunity to develop these three important pillars and look forward to working with our retail partners to drive growth through innovation and excitement in the category.”

The world’s second largest beer maker – and owner of brands such as Tiger, Cruzcampo and Amstel – posted net revenues of €22.47 billion for 2018. Operating profit grew 2.9% to €3.89 billion.

Heineken branded beer volume grew 7.7%, its strongest performance in more than a decade. Ten markets now sell more than 1 million hectolitres of Heineken branded beer. Volumes grew double digit in Brazil, South Africa, Russia, the UK, Nigeria, Mexico, Poland and Germany, and China returned to growth.

The company’s international beer portfolio grew double digit, with volumes up for Tiger, Desperados, Birra Moretti and Krušovice.

Heineken highlighted the “continued success” of Heineken 0.0, as the firm’s low- and no-alcohol volumes increased mid-single digit.

Despite the positive performance, Heineken USA’s beer volume declined high-single digit. The company’s Lagunitas subsidiary, which it fully acquired in 2017, recorded a low-single-digit decline in volumes.

Jean-François van Boxmeer, Heineken CEO, said: “In 2018 we delivered another year of superior top-line growth. The Heineken brand grew 7.7%, its best performance in over a decade, with Heineken 0.0 now available in 38 countries. Our premium portfolio grew double digit, led by our international brands, craft and variety and cider portfolios.

“All regions grew and Brazil recorded a strong performance following the successful integration of our two businesses. Our operating profit margin (beia) decreased by 17 bps due to the first time consolidation of Brazil, rising input costs and adverse currency developments. A key milestone in 2018 was the announcement of the strategic partnership with CRE to join forces in China, a big opportunity for both companies, which is pending regulatory approval.

“Our strategic priorities are growth oriented with an ever-increasing emphasis on the sustainability of this growth, both socially and environmentally. We focus on innovation and operational excellence so our consumers enjoy our brands and we exceed our customers’ expectations, whilst seeking productivity improvements and constantly reassessing our spending behaviour. Going into 2019, we expect the environment to remain uncertain and volatile.”

The UK-based milk supplier said the programme aims to secure a vibrant future for the business, benefiting consumers, customers, employees and farmers.

Called Project Darwin, the initiative includes a comprehensive review of every aspect of MMI’s operations – including logistics, back office and people organisation – in order to simplify the business, reduce costs and further improve customer focus and accountability.

The 12-month programme is already underway, but the company stressed it is too early to convey specific changes in each part of the MMI business and organisation and in customer relationships and priorities.

MMI CEO Patrick Müller said: “Fresh milk is loved by British families with 96% of UK households having milk in their fridges. But the market environment has changed significantly due to global dairy market volatility, decline in consumption and changes in retailing and we need to adapt and return to sustainable levels of profitability so that fresh milk can continue to be part of the fabric of British life.

“We have the best-invested network in our industry and aim to be the leading fresh milk processor in the country for years to come. We’ve invested in unique and class-leading propositions in farm to fridge product quality and shelf life. We have fully recyclable packaging including securing 50% of Britain’s stocks of recycled HDPE for use in bottles, efficient dairies and innovative ways of working with farmers to help protect them from market volatility.

“Project Darwin is about adapting to the changing market environment, becoming a customer-centric, agile and simpler business.

“This transformation programme will inevitably require tough decisions and a great deal of change but when Project Darwin succeeds, consumers, customers, employees and farmers will benefit, and we can again look forward to a vibrant and progressive future.”

MMI said it has already started the transformation by securing long-term strategic partnerships with customers. Last month, the business inked a dairy sourcing deal with Lidl in the UK.

The cost-saving initiative comes two months after MMI revealed a £15 million investment to sustainably upgrade its fresh milk facility in Bellshill, Scotland.

The company said the project “represents the largest single investment in Scottish dairy processing for more than a decade” and gives the Bellshill site the capacity to process more than 370 million litres of fresh milk and cream each year.",Müller reveals £100m cost and margin improvement initiative

MZBG – owner of brands such as Segafredo Zanetti and Kauai Coffee – earlier this month completed the acquisition of Australian coffee group The Bean Alliance for AUD 24 million ($17.4 million).

Called Shrooms Snacks, four product lines are sold in the US in a total of 14 flavours.

Shrooms Crispy Mushrooms are crispy-crunchy snacks made from thick-cut mushrooms, available in five flavours: sea salt, spicy jalapeno, mesquite barbeque, pizza, and original portabella.

Meanwhile, Shrooms Mushroom Jerky is made from tender shiitake and meaty portabella mushroom caps. Flavours include honey chipotle shiitake, roasted teriyaki portabella, and original portabella.

Shrooms Splits Jerky is a hybrid snack which pairs marinated mushroom jerky made from portabella mushroom caps with other jerky varieties including turkey, berries, filet mignon, and peppered beef.

Finally, Shrooms Snack Bar is said to be an allergy-friendly bar made from simple ingredients. Flavours include crispy mushroom chocolate chunk and crispy mushroom sweet and savoury.

South Mill Champs said mushrooms are a functional superfood, packed with nutrients such as vitamins D and B, selenium, potassium, zinc, copper and fibre. All Shrooms Snacks product lines are tree nut free and dairy free.

“We saw an opportunity to create something new and authentic using our 80 years of mushroom growing experience,” said David Eberwein, director of innovation and business development at Shrooms Snacks.

“As the popularity of plant-based snacking continues to rise, we started thinking about ways to reinvent the mushroom to create convenient, better-for-you snacks that taste amazing and use the fresh, whole mushrooms we’re growing and farming every day.

“After much development, we’ve created a line of snack products that are unlike anything else on shelves today, and we’re excited to bring them to mushroom lovers everywhere.”

South Mill Champs CEO Lewis Macleod added: “Mushrooms are experiencing a surge in popularity as people from all walks of life get smart about snacking. With more than 80 years of experience, we know mushrooms, so we’re a natural fit to lead the development of this category of great-tasting, better-for-you snacks.

"There are more pink gin and rosé wine options this Valentine's Day than ever, according to new figures from the UK's Wine and Spirits Trade Association.","February 13, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/alcohol-alcoholic-beverage-anniversary-1571764.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/uk-has-more-choice-in-pink-drinks-than-ever-thanks-to-record-year/,"There will be more than a few couples toasting this Valentine’s Day with a pink gin or rosé prosecco – and according to new research they have more options than ever, thanks to a record year for pink drinks.

The figures from the Wine and Spirits Trade Association (WSTA), which represents the industry in the UK alone, show that flavoured gin grew by more than 750% between 2017 and 2018.

British consumers bought 66 million bottles of gin in the past year, up 41% on the same period the year before and worth over £1.9 billion in total. A huge part of that surge was down to sales of pink gin and flavoured gin, with hundreds of new products coming to market.

Two years ago only a handful of brands were making flavoured gin, yet last year the category was valued at £165 million.

Miles Beale, the chief executive of the WSTA, said: “Pink drinks are increasingly popular thanks to our innovative distillers and wine makers who are responding to consumer demands for quality drinks with a splash of colour. We have seen a massive increase in the choices of pink and flavoured gins, there are signs of a renewed fondness in rosé wines, and liqueurs like Campari and Aperol mixed with sparkling wine have boosted Brits’ love of pink cocktails.

“The introduction of new products combined with a fantastic, long hot summer has helped boost the pink category and Valentine’s Day will no doubt see another pink spike. There is no doubt that the pink category has benefited by consumers’ love for sharing vibrant, colourful drink trends on social media.”

Indeed, research has shown that the explosion in pink drinks has been driven by a resurgence in gin – once seen as a stuffy, old-fashioned tipple – and growing popularity with demographics under the age of 45.

The gin category is expected to grow this year as brands launch new flavoured and pink gin products, while sales of rosé wine have recorded their first growth in five years.

The WSTA’s latest figures show that Brits bought over 100 million bottles of rosé wine through the off-trade in the last 12 months – over 2 million more bottles than the previous year – with value growth at 5%.

The discounter Aldi expects to sell 13 million bottles of rosé this year, and only accounts for a 7.5% share of the UK’s grocery market.

Julie Ashfield, managing director of buying for Aldi UK, said: “We usually see a rise in rosé sales as the weather gets warmer and we move into spring, but recently we’ve started to see an increased demand for rosé all year round thanks to drinkers who love to post about it on Instagram.

“To meet this rising demand, we’ve stocked our shelves already and are expecting an early rush on sales.”","UK has more choice of pink drinks than ever, thanks to record year"

The Darigold portfolio includes a range of milk, butter, cheese, sour cream, cottage cheese and whipping cream.

A standout performer for the year was Nespresso, which maintained mid-single-digit growth, with “very strong momentum” in North America. Growth was supported by innovation and strong demand for the recently launched Master Origin range.

Nestlé’s Asia, Oceania and Sub-Saharan Africa business also performed well, with a reported net sales increase of 2.2%. China saw improved growth compared to 2017, supported by innovations in infant nutrition, coffee and culinary.

However, in zone Americas, the company’s largest area by revenue, sales shrank 0.9% compared to 2017.

All financial performance metrics improved significantly and we saw revived growth in our two largest markets, the United States and China, as well as in our infant nutrition business. Nestlé keeps investing in future growth and – at the same time – has increased the amount of cash returned to shareholders through our dividend and share buyback programme.

“We made significant progress with our portfolio transformation and sharpened our group’s strategic focus, strengthening key growth categories and geographies in the process. Our unique nutrition, health and wellness strategy, with food, beverage and nutritional health products at its core, has become much clearer as we completed a sizeable number of transactions and announced strategic reviews for Nestlé Skin Health and Herta.

“In 2018, we upgraded our innovation engine notably to ensure continued technology leadership and a shorter time to market. In the fast-changing food and beverage space, Nestlé has what it takes to truly excite consumers with meaningful innovation and must-have products.

“We reaffirmed our sustainability leadership at a time when consumers and regulators around the world are increasingly looking for solutions to today’s environmental and societal problems. Our decisive action and strong commitments to tackle the global packaging waste problem are a case in point.

“We are on our way to meeting our 2020 targets and positioning Nestlé for sustained and sustainable growth in the years beyond.”

During 2018, Nestlé completed acquisitions and divestments with a total transaction value of around CHF 14 billion ($13.9 billion).

The Coca-Cola North America innovation team developed the new variant in less than a year – from concept, to testing, to launch.

The company said the launch is an example of it listening to what consumers want and offering an array choices that satisfy a variety of changing tastes and lifestyles.

A full marketing campaign will support the launch across TV, social, digital, outdoor, mobile, radio and experiential.

Tyson Foods recorded a 0.4% reduction in first-quarter sales as the company struggled with “challenging market conditions” in the pork sector.,"February 08, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Noel-White.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/tyson-foods-first-quarter-sales-down-as-pork-segment-struggles/,"Tyson Foods recorded a 0.4% reduction in first-quarter sales as the company struggled with “challenging market conditions” in the pork sector.

For the three months to December 29, the US meat processor – owner of brands such as Jimmy Dean and Sara Lee – recorded sales of $10.19 billion. Operating income shrank 12.5% to $807 million.

The company said it is experiencing impacts to domestic and export prices, primarily chicken and pork, resulting from uncertainty in trade policies and increased tariffs. All the firm’s four segments experienced increased operating and labour costs during the quarter.

Pork producers in the US have been hit by retaliatory tariffs recently from both China and Mexico, leading to excess domestic availability of pork products. Tyson said it is working to increase its revenue per head as well as expand its export business.

Meanwhile, sales in the company’s largest segment, beef, were up 1%, partly thanks to strong export demand and more favourable domestic market conditions associated with an increase in cattle supply.

Noel White, who was appointed Tyson Foods CEO last September, said in an earnings call: “Strong organic growth in prepared foods and strong beef fundamentals led the performance while pork and chicken performed well given market conditions. The dynamics across the different businesses highlight the advantage of Tyson’s diversified business model, but they work together to provide balance and opportunity for long-term growth.

“In the prepared food segment, it was a record first quarter with $268 million in operating income and a 12.5% return on sale, building on the momentum of the record year in 2018. With quarter performance of prepared foods is obscured by divestitures of several non-core businesses last year. When those are excluded prepared foods delivered over 3% revenue growth and double-digit profit growth in the first quarter and modest volume increases. This demonstrates the effectiveness of branded value-added multi-channel prepared foods model.”

He added: “We are combining our creativity, our scale and our resources to make great taste in protein alternatives that more accessible for everyone both domestically and internationally. We will be leveraging all the resources we have at our disposal. Our insights, our innovation, manufacturing, sales, distribution and a global platform. And in the weeks ahead, you’ll be hearing more from us as we announce new products in the alternative protein space.”

The results were published as Tyson reached an agreement to acquire the Thai and European operations of BRF for $340 million, expanding its offerings of value-added protein in global markets.

The purchase includes four poultry processing facilities in Thailand, one in the UK and one in the Netherlands.",Tyson Foods first-quarter sales down as pork segment struggles
UPM Raflatac has completed the pilot of its smart label solution for e-commerce that logs and shares information about packages during the delivery process.,"February 08, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/UPM-Raflatac.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/upm-raflatac-completes-pilot-for-e-commerce-smart-label-solution/,"UPM Raflatac has completed the first pilot of its new smart label solution for e-commerce that uses internet of packaging technology to log and share information about packages during the delivery process.

Called RafMore for e-commerce, the label is said to add transparency, reduce inefficiencies and waste, and improve the user experience for e-retailers, logistics providers and consumers.

Information attached to labels can be updated online or by scanning a code without needing to print a new label for the package. For example, designated users can reset a delivery address and time, which saves time and reduces the carbon footprint generated by failed delivery attempts.

UPM Raflatac said that as e-commerce purchases rise, brands are looking for new ways to interact with their customers outside of the point of sale, while consumers want to easily make returns, reorder and give immediate feedback if there are any issues with the shipment. The company said this is can now be done by scanning the RafMore label with a mobile device.

Sami Poukka, vice president for global business and segment development at UPM Raflatac, said: “We don’t want to build a new tracking system or replace existing systems. We want to pull all the information from the supply chain together in one place and this way increase transparency.”

The solution was piloted on UPM Raflatac’s shipments on various routes throughout Europe. The pilot demonstrated that it provides full interoperability between supply chain stakeholders without requiring heavy IT integration.

For the final phase of testing before the commercial launch later in 2019, UPM Raflatac will recruit e-commerce retailers to test the solution with actual orders and customers.

Cott Corporation has announced the sale of its soft drink concentrate production business and its RCI International division.,"February 11, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Sugarfinal.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/cott-sells-soft-drink-concentrate-production-business-to-refresco/,"Cott Corporation has announced the sale of its soft drink concentrate production business and its RCI International division to Refresco for $50 million.

The transaction follows Refresco’s acquisition of Cott’s bottling business in January 2018 – a $1.25 billion deal which created the largest independent bottler in Europe and North America with a combined production volume of approximately 12 billion litres.

Refresco said it has simultaneously sold the RCI International division to holding company RC Global Beverages.

Tom Harrington, who was appointed Cott CEO last year, said: “This transaction is the final step in the transformation of our business where selling the remaining business unit of the traditional carbonated soft drinks business is consistent with our strategy of accelerating the growth across our platform in water, coffee, tea, extracts and filtration solutions.

“We want to thank all the associates of Cott Beverages LLC for their contributions and wish them well as they rejoin their former traditional bottling business colleagues and become a part of Refresco.”

Hans Roelofs, CEO Refresco, added: “We are pleased to add Cott’s Columbus concentrate manufacturing facility to Refresco North America. It adds extensive innovation capabilities and skills and creates a global centre of excellence for beverage concentrate manufacturing. It is a perfect fit with our business.

“We have decided to divest the RCI International branded activities and find an owner who can bring similar focus and continuity to this iconic brand. With RC Global Beverages Inc, we believe we have found an excellent match. The sale of Columbus from Cott to Refresco and the sale of the RCI International activities from Refresco to RC Global Beverages Inc took place simultaneously.”

The deal sees Cott effectively divest all its carbonated soft drinks operations.

In its 2016 annual report, Cott noted that “four major national non-alcoholic beverage companies – Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestlé Waters North America and Dr. Pepper Snapple – control 60.8% of the total CSD and alternative beverage category within the United States”.

It suggested, with much of its business elsewhere, it was unable to compete effectively in the soft drinks category.

The company now aims to grow its water and coffee solutions businesses. Last year, it acquired The Mountain Valley Spring Company through its DS Services subsidiary for $75.8 million.",Cott sells soft drink concentrate production business to Refresco

Called Craigs Creamery, the range has been introduced as a response to heightened consumer interest in wanting to know who produces their food.

The line consists of cheeses such as mozzarella, cheddar and muenster, available in slices, shreds, chunks and snack bars. DFA said each is “crafted with high-quality milk, all-natural ingredients and no added hormones”.

Doug Glade, DFA executive vice president of commercial operations, said: “As a cooperative, we’re committed to responsibly producing milk and bringing high-quality dairy products from our family farms to family tables.

“With Craigs Creamery, consumers get to know where their food comes from and can have confidence it was sourced responsibly, which we know is highly important to today’s consumer.”

Chris Noble, a seventh-generation farmer at Craigs Creamery farm Noblehurst Farms, added: “As a small collective of family farms, we keep a close eye on the purity and freshness of our milk – each cow has a customised, nutritionist-led diet to ensure they produce only the highest-quality milk, which results in our great-tasting, award-winning cheese.

“Fresh milk is picked up from the farms daily and delivered to the creamery, which is located just a few miles from where the cows are milked.”

He added: “At Craigs Creamery, we’re focused on the future of farming, which is why we’re constantly seeking new methods to reduce our carbon footprint. From the biodigester to solar panels to recycling water waste, we are investing in sustainable methods and working towards becoming a 100% sustainable operation.”",Dairy Farmers of America debuts Craigs Creamery cheese brand

“Now, with access to greater resources, we’ll be able to continue modernising the site, and expand into new areas, like an affiliate marketplace in Australia.

Niagara will start constructing the 450,000-square-foot facility in March 2019, and the company estimates that the facility will begin operating in the fourth quarter of the year.

Construction of the facility will be divided into two phases. The first phase will see $70 million invested and 49 jobs created, while the second phase will see a further $20 million invested, adding 21 new jobs.

Niagara is one of the largest producers of private-label bottled water products in the US, and the company has been expanding its manufacturing network over the last few years.

In 2017, the company invested $76 million to build a production facility in Mesa, Arizona and acquired a further manufacturing site in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania as part of its acquisition of First Quality’s bottled water business.

Niagara does not use BPA – an industrial chemical used in the creation of certain plastics – in any of its products, while all bottles and caps produced by the company are 100% recyclable.

Brian Hess, executive vice-president of Niagara Bottling, said: “Niagara Bottling is committed to supporting our local community, our team members and our environment.

“We are very excited to establish one of our newest beverage manufacturing facilities in Temple, Texas. We chose Temple as our new home for a number of reasons including what we felt was a highly competitive and attractive combination of location, infrastructure and workforce.

Could a campaign to raise awareness of the benefits of genetically modified (GM) crops in the chocolate industry change consumers' perceptions of GM foods?,"February 11, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/190108_15_RS.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/ethos-chocolate-could-consumers-accept-a-pro-gmo-food-brand/,"As new research suggests an inverse correlation between objection to and understanding of genetically modified foods, could a brand that says it’s “pro-GMO” find favour among consumers?

That’s the question being posed by A Fresh Look, a nonprofit aiming to demystify GMO farming, in the run-up to Valentine’s Day.

The organisation – a coalition of more than 1,600 farmers – has launched a new campaign that centres around a line of pro-GMO chocolates called Ethos. The nonprofit is giving away 4,000 of the bars in total, with visitors to Ethos’ website being encouraged to mail samples to loved ones in the US.

There are four flavours based on cacao, papaya, orange and apple – all crops that have been made more sustainable or more viable by genetic engineering, A Fresh Look says. For example, GMOs saved Hawaii’s papaya industry after it was decimated by ring spot virus and has led to the development of non-browning apples that stay fresher for longer.

As its name suggests, A Fresh Look is encouraging consumers to re-evaluate their perceptions of GM food.

Rebecca Larson, lead scientist for the organisation, said: “We know many Americans are passionate about chocolate, so we’ve created a product to tangibly illustrate the benefits of a technology that is often misunderstood. Chocolate is worth saving, so what could be a better embodiment of the benefits of biotechnology than creating our own line of chocolates to tell that story?”

New research has found that people who hold the most extreme views against GM food often think they know most about the science behind it, but actually know the least. The paper – from researchers at universities in Colorado, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Toronto, and published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour – found a generally inverse relationship between a person’s strength of opposition to GM foods and the amount that they knew about it. The survey canvassed more than 2,000 American and European adults.

And separate research, published in 2018 by the Hartman Group, found that 46% of US consumers generally avoid foods labelled “genetically modified” – despite no evidence that GM goods are detrimental to human health.

A further 42% of respondents said they look out for the Non-GMO Project Verified mark on packaging, underlining the strength of opposition – particularly in North America – to GMOs.

But Ethos Chocolate is painting GM foods as the only sustainable way forward for a food industry under constant pressure – not least from a changing planet and a growing demand on food resources.

The impact of climate change – including a lack of water, warmer temperatures and greater pest interference – threatens the future of the cacao tree, with some estimates that it could go extinct within 20-30 years.

“I know first-hand how challenging it is to maintain cacao orchards,” said Eric Reid, a cacao grower and owner of Spagnvola Chocolatiers, the company that produced the limited run on Ethos Chocolate. “As a single-estate chocolatier, I understand how the finest chocolates are derived from the hands of farmers. We must take care of the cacao plant if we want to continue enjoying one of the world’s most cherished foods.”

“We want to help educate the public on the value of GMO farming and the positive impact biotechnology can have on a local and global scale, like slashing pesticide use by an average of 37% worldwide,” Rebecca Larson continued. “We want people to enjoy these delicious chocolates, but also take a fresh look at GMOs.”

The brand says that the awareness-raising campaign has been a hit with consumers, with just days until the chocolate industry’s annual Valentine’s windfall – the third biggest holiday for an industry that’s worth $22 billion in the US alone.

“The pro-GMO chocolate bars have been very popular,” a spokesperson for the brand told FoodBev. “We’ve currently given away 3,000 chocolate bars and have 1,000 chocolate bars remaining to give away. We will be opening up the website each morning and giving away approximately 250 chocolate bars a day leading up to Valentine’s.”",Ethos Chocolate: Can consumers accept a 'pro-GMO' food brand?

Boston-based Bevi produces a range of touch-screen operated beverage dispensers which allow users to select still or sparkling water in a variety of flavours.

Bevi said that the funding will be used to accelerate product development across the company’s hardware, software and beverage portfolio, expand the company’s sales footprint within the US and Canada and build brand awareness with consumers.

In particular, Bevi is working to develop machines that include temperature control, wider control over carbonation, and allow the infusion of functional ingredients such as vitamins.

The company says that customisation will play an important role in the beverage industry in the future, as more consumers are demanding personalised and tailored beverages.

“I commented then I wouldn’t even know what to do with $2 million. Now it’s funny — we have $35 million and I feel like I know exactly what to do with it.

“Even though we’re a technology company, long-term it’s really important that we connect with our end users as well as all of our customers.

“Since we are a mission-driven company, we started Bevi to eliminate disposable bottles and cans, we’d love to really galvanise our user base and listen more to what our users are saying and work with them to turn Bevi into a meaningful brand that people know and feel affiliated with.

“In a way, Bevi could become almost an anti-brand, if you think of a brand as mass producing a very standard product designed to be exactly the same everywhere.

The new Dutch Chocolate and Mint Chocolate flavours were developed following a small batch testing process with several focus groups, with SGC reformulating its formula to create a smoother and more balanced chocolate recipe.

SGC introduced the Mocca Shots range last year, claiming that the gummies contain the highest concentration of caffeine available in the energy products market.

SGC claims that the caffeine in each Mocha Shot is absorbed five times faster than products such as energy drinks as the ingredients are absorbed by mouth mucus, bypassing the conventional digestive process and entering the bloodstream in less than five minutes.

The gummies are also exclusively made using natural ingredients, meaning that consumers avoid the artificial ingredients and sweeteners found in some energy drinks.

Dr Connie Wan, CEO of SGC, said: “If you want energy fast, Mocca Shots are a much better choice than energy drinks.

“We knew we could create a product with natural ingredients that not only tastes better but is also more effective at helping people focus without the jittery side-effects normally associated with caffeine.”",SGC unveils two new high-caffeine Mocca Shots flavours

The transaction is subject to the approval of Mackay’s shareholders and other conditions such as the sale of one of its four sugar factories.

The equity and debt capital contribution will mainly be used for maintenance and capital expenditures in order to significantly increase the availability Mackay’s three remaining plants with an annual production capacity of about 700,000 tonnes of sugar over the next few years.

Lars Gorissen, Nordzucker chairman of the executive board, said: “The growth in sugar is taking place in regions outside the EU. By acquiring a stake in Mackay Sugar, we can secure a substantial share of the Australian market and gain access to the Southeast Asian market.

Nitin Paranjpe, president of Unilever’s food and refreshment business, said: “Graze is the leading healthy snacking brand in the UK – delivering consumers fabulously tasty snacking options, delivered in beautiful packaging. A truly multichannel brand, Graze offers personalisation, convenience and great nutrition, brilliantly meeting the needs of millennial consumers.

“Accelerating our presence in healthy foods and out of home, this is an excellent strategic fit for the Unilever food and refreshment business, and a wonderful addition to our stable of purpose-driven brands.

“We look forward to working with the Graze team to grow the business, leveraging their tech and e-commerce expertise for our wider portfolio, and offering more consumers the opportunity to snack in a healthier way.”

Graze CEO Anthony Fletcher added: “This deal marks a transformational moment in Graze’s growth journey. Graze believes that learning from Unilever’s sustainable living plan will become a key driver for the business.

“Graze has an incredibly exciting future ahead as part of Unilever and we look forward to working closely with the team to keep on inventing new healthy snacks, as well as continuing to work to understand the role technology can play in improving the food industry.”

The announcement comes a week after Unilever reported a 5% reduction in full-year turnover – owing to adverse currency impacts and the disposal of its spreads unit at the end of 2017.

Alan Jope, who took over as Unilever CEO from Paul Polman at the start of the year, said the firm’s number one priority is accelerating growth. “With so many of our brands enjoying leadership positions, we have significant opportunities to develop our markets, as well as to benefit from our deep global reach and purpose-led brands.”",Unilever looks to grow in healthy snacking sector with Graze deal
"Sustainable Bioproducts, a biotechnology company which has developed a new way to grow edible protein, has raised $33m in a Series A Financing round...","February 04, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SustainableBioproducts-Volcanic-organism-protein.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/sustainable-bioproducts-raises-33m-in-series-a-financing-round/,"Sustainable Bioproducts, a Chicago-based biotechnology company which has developed a new way to grow edible protein, has raised $33 million in a Series A Financing round.

The funding round was led by 1955 Capital, a Silicon Valley-based venture fund, while ADM Ventures and Danone Manifesto Ventures, the venture capital arms of ADM and Danone; Lauder Partners and the Liebelson family also participated in the financing round.

Based in the University of Chicago’s Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Sustainable Bioproducts’ technology was developed following research into extremophile organisms that live in Yellowstone National Park’s volcanic springs.

The company’s work has led to the development of an innovative fermentation technology, which can grow protein “with great nutritional value and minimal impact on the environment”.

According to Sustainable Bioproducts, the process involves ‘feeding’ common food components such as starches or glycerin to the high-protein microbes, which then quickly multiply.

The resulting products produced by the process contain the nine amino acids considered essential to the human diet, potentially creating a new, sustainable method of meeting the growing global demand for protein.

Organisations such as NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the US Department of Agriculture have also provided financial and in-kind support to the company in the recent past.

Thomas Jonas, Sustainable Bioproducts’ CEO and co-founder said: “Curiosity and a passion for exploration led us to Yellowstone, one of the harshest ecosystems in the world.

“By observing how life optimises the use of resources in this challenging environment, we have invented a way to make protein that is radically more efficient and gentler on our planet.”

Andrew Chung, managing partner of 1955 Capital, said: “We have witnessed incredible growth in the demand for new proteins in recent years and believe Sustainable Bioproducts has the most compelling and efficient solution to satisfy this demand.

“This demand will not only come from the West, but from the developing world where the need for protein will become more severe.”

Interest in meat alternatives is growing among major food companies, as more consumers are changing their consumption habits in the face of growing environmental and ethical concerns.

For example, last month Nestlé announced plans to introduce a plant-based, meat-free burger in the spring called the ‘Incredible Burger’, which is set to rival other meat alternatives such as the Impossible Burger and the Beyond Burger,

US meat giant Tyson Foods has also invested in a number of cultured meat producers in 2018, including a $2.2 million investment in Israel-based biotechnology company Future Meat Technologies, and a further investment in US-based food tech start-up Memphis Meats.

Israel-based start-up Aleph Farms also produced what it claimed is ‘the first’ cell-grown minute steak in December 2018, claiming that the ‘slaughter-free steak’ replicates the appearance, shape, and texture of conventional beef cuts.",Sustainable Bioproducts raises $33m in Series A Financing round

The beverage is first in the new Love Gin Liqueur range and is recognised by its fuchsia colour that comes from a combination of Madagascan vanilla, Croatian juniper, goji berry, rose petal and Scottish raspberry.

An amalgamation of aromas is said to create a “complex and decadent flavour profile” evocative of Turkish delight and raspberry ripple ice cream. The liqueur is presented in a glossed red carton, embellished with subtle roses.

Eden Mill said the 20% ABV Love Gin Liqueur delivers a sweet and creamy taste over a soft backdrop of vanilla, with a sweet scent of raspberry syrup.

Paul Miller, Eden Mill co-founder, said: “We are excited to release our new Love Gin Liqueur and believe it will be a bottle that customers can enjoy all year round – not just at Valentine’s Day.

“This versatile liqueur can be enjoyed neat, or over ice served with premium tonic and is the perfect addition to any gin lover’s gantry.”

The liqueur is retailing for £18 for a 50cl bottle at supermarkets such as Sainsbury’s, Asda and Aldi. A 70cl bottle is available on the off trade.

The launch comes as Eden Mill expands its operations through the acquisition of English beer maker Eden River Brewery.

Gato has used chickpea water in place of eggs, ground almonds to replace flour and courgette instead of butter in its two reformulated puddings: hot chocolate and coconut brownie, and hot salted caramel sticky toffee pudding. Other ingredients include almond milk, raw cacao and creamed coconut.

The new caramel chocolate ganache pot features sweet date syrup blended with oat milk and dark chocolate.

Gato & Co co-founder Kim Lamza said: “We’ve been working hard behind the scenes for the past year to make our range fully vegan, so everyone can enjoy our indulgent and healthier puds.

The cartons are made from wood-fibre cardboard and the renewable plastic used to make the caps and to line the cartons is made from plant ethanol, which is a side flow of the sugarcane industry.

Valio sells around 250 million milk, cream and yogurt cartons every year in Finland. The transition to plant-based packaging is said to reduce CO2 emissions by 3,140 tonnes each year.

The firm now aims to make all its cartons out of renewable, plant-based material and is studying ways to make plant-based juice cartons.

Tanja Virtanen-Leppä, Valio packaging development manager, said: “Development of the juice carton plastic layer has gone well, and we will be able to produce nearly 100% plant-based juice cartons as soon as this year.

“Our goal is to be smart about reducing our total environmental effect: the right kinds of packages protect the products and prevent food waste, and plant-based packaging reduces the products’ carbon footprint. We are also increasing our use of recycled raw material, and encourage consumers to recycle our packaging correctly.

“Valio’s packaging development is guided strongly by the fact that people want our packages to be fully plant-based. There are also packages on the market that are only partially plant-based, with part of the raw material being fossil. In these solutions, the calculated share of plant-based material is based on the mass balance of the raw materials, not 100% renewable materials: the plastic is made with fossil oil and only a small part of the raw material is actually plant-based.”",Valio Finland moves to 100% plant-based cartons for dairy line

Tate & Lyle has announced a new research project with Earthwatch and Sweet Green Fields to assess the sustainability of the stevia sweetener supply chain.,"February 15, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tate-Lyle-stevia-2.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/tyte-lyle-joins-earthwatch-to-research-sustainability-of-stevia/,"Tate & Lyle has announced a new research project with its Sweet Green Fields stevia partner to assess the sustainability of the stevia sweetener supply chain.

The companies have joined forces with Earthwatch, an independent, non-profit based organisation, as they aim to identify steps to ensure that as the stevia market grows, sustainable growing practices are embedded and socio-economic benefits are maximised.

Tate & Lyle said it will use the research insights to establish and spread sustainability best practice across its stevia supply chains.

The announcement comes after Tate & Lyle acquired a 15% stake in US-based Sweet Green Fields last year and then launched a new line of stevia-based sweeteners in partnership with the business.

Stevia is a low-calorie sweetener that is becoming increasingly popular with food and beverage producers looking for consumer-friendly sugar alternatives that help them to reduce sugar and calories in their products.

Tate & Lyle said much of the world’s stevia supply is grown in China. Earthwatch-led scientists have begun conducting on-the-ground research in China to evaluate the socio-environmental impacts of stevia production, including analysing soil, water, waste, and energy impacts, as well as the effect on farming communities. Earthwatch will engage with a range of stakeholders in the stevia supply chain, from seedling producers to family-run planters and industrial farms.

Earthwatch senior research manager Steven Loiselle said: “Stevia farming is a key economic activity in many areas in China and a rapidly growing global ingredient for sugar replacement. Our project, working with leading researchers, producers and others, shows how multi-partner collaborations can be used to promote sustainable production.

“By working with local scientists and experts within China we are developing new knowledge for both Tate & Lyle, the broader stevia industry and local communities.”

Abigail Storms, VP sweetener platform and global platform marketing at Tate & Lyle, added: “As a leading provider of stevia to the food industry, Tate & Lyle wants to ensure that using stevia in greater quantities in the future as a replacement for sugar is a responsible choice for our business, as well as a healthy choice for consumers around the world.

“We are proud to be working with our partners Sweet Green Fields and Earthwatch to support sustainable stevia production to ensure that stevia not only improves consumer lives, but also supports sustainable livelihoods and farming practices in the supply chain, with minimal impact on the environment.”",Tate & Lyle joins Earthwatch to research sustainability of stevia
"Raúl Anta, director of Refix, explains how sustainability and natural resources can be used to improve the perception of recovery drinks.","February 14, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/refix-feature.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/interview-using-natural-resources-in-recovery-drinks/,"Recovery drinks have come under fire in the past for containing too many additives, such as sugar and artificial colours. This has led to more companies applying the organic trend to new, innovative products to entice consumers back to such beverages.

One such product looking to establish itself in the natural recovery space is Refix. Made from seawater, this recovery drink is marketed as a natural way to restore hydration post-workout, or as a way to recover from a night out.

Raúl Anta, director of Refix, explains how sustainability and natural resources can be used to improve the perception of recovery drinks.

What was it that attracted you to the recovery drinks sector?

My experience lies mainly in the environmental sector, related to marine reserves. In 2015, I studied a master’s degree in Madrid on Natural Protected Areas, and my project consisted of how to increase the monetary value of a marine reserve so that politicians and citizens understood how important it is to protect the ocean and create more marine reserves.

I learned that the Galician coast produces 3% of Spanish GDP thanks to direct fishing; it’s one of the most productive coasts in the world.

We decided to extract a natural resource from the marine reserve (seawater) and create a sustainable and healthy product that respects the environment. This became Refix.

It all began as a project of environmental sustainability, and that has been transformed into a business venture.

Currently, we collaborate with the marine reserve Os Miñarzos, the only one in Europe that follows a bottom-up model where fishermen make initial decisions for the government to approve later.

What methods did you use in order to get Refix noticed and to viably fill the gap in the market?

Refix is the only drink on the market that is truly restorative. It eliminates hangovers produced by alcohol, which is something consumers immediately take to.

The most important newspapers in Spain quickly realised this and wrote about our product, and that took us to Latin America which then led us to the United States, and back to Europe in countries like Italy, Slovenia, Switzerland, and Austria.

Refix can be used for athletes to recover more than 80 different mineral salts lost by sweating, but the “hangover issue” made Refix a top-selling drink on Amazon Spain.

Why is there a pursuit of more ‘premium’, natural recovery drinks?

The main ingredient in most recovery drinks is sugar. They also have preservatives and colouring agents. Some drinks have two or three mineral salts included, but they are synthetic, added minerals.

So you can see how most recovery drinks are very harmful for health, because they are composed just like soft drinks. That’s why consumers know that it’s important to read labels, and most people end up choosing science-based, natural products.

Are you looking to expand the functionalities of Refix into other sectors?

We are going to make a half-litre format, but we will not any make more products or more flavours.

We have a unique product, and we want to work every day to improve each of its ingredients, and make a product increasingly sustainable for the environment.",Interview: Using natural resources in recovery drinks

In their 2019 Dynamic Maternal Nutrition Market in Asia Report, Zenith Global contends that there is a potential in the region for up to 475,000 tonnes of dairy ingredients by 2023, including commodity milk powders, and high-value specialty products using dairy proteins and milk fat.

Despite regulatory restrictions being placed on sales of infant formula, and increasing rates of breastfeeding in the region, the Asian market has seen a growth of dairy-based maternal nutrition supplements. This can provide extra nutritional support to pregnant and lactating women in countries where the local diet does not provide necessary nutrition during pregnancy.

Due to a number of factors, such as rising incomes, new scientific studies, supportive governmental policies and programmes, and freedom to promote, sales of dairy nutrition products for new mothers are growing at an estimated 20% year on year. Around 13 million households are part of this growing market.

Consumers in the region are becoming more aware of optimal nutrition in early life stages, and this growing awareness has led to the rise in maternal nutrition products. These offer more opportunities for pregnant and lactating mothers to provide this promised nutrition to their babies.",Zenith Global reports growth in maternal nutrition for Asia

Sales for the year stood at $31.86 billion. However, organic revenues grew 5% and operating income increased 14% to $8.7 billion.

Coke tied up the refranchising of its North American bottling operations last March in a move to create a system of economically aligned bottling partners with the capability to serve major customers, coupled with the ability to maintain strong ties across diverse markets.

Aside from its bottling investments unit, the company recorded sales rises across key markets; net revenues grew 9% in North America and by 4% in Europe, Middle East and Africa.

As consumers increasingly look for healthier alternatives to sugary sodas, Coca-Cola has looked to grow its low-calorie drinks portfolio. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar had its best year in 2018, posting double-digit volume growth globally, and the firm has already launched two new Diet Coke flavours this year.

However, in the fourth quarter of the year, Coke’s juice, dairy and plant-based beverages volume declined 2% in North America as “strong growth” in Fairlife and Honest juices was offset by the impact of package downsizing across the juice portfolio.

James Quincey, Coca-Cola CEO, said: “I am pleased with our strong organic revenue and earnings growth in 2018. Our results demonstrate progress in our transformation as a consumer-centric, total beverage company and the power of a more strategically aligned system. Coca-Cola has established a strong foundation to capitalise on long-term growth opportunities and drive sustained shareowner value.”

The company drew attention to its increased agility and the strength of its distribution system last year, helping it launch approximately 500 products across multiple markets through its “lift, shift and scale” strategy, while also accelerating the elimination of underperforming products.

Coke inked a range of noteworthy acquisitions last year, including deals for sports drink brand Bodyarmor and UK coffee chain Costa.

Investors in the brand include Nick Heldfond, who was an early investor in KeVita kombucha, and the founders of Thrive Market, an online retailer with a focus on organic foods. Athletes such as Chris and Kimmy Benchetler were also involved in investment.

This range of investors from various backgrounds will give JuneShine input from various targeted sectors.

As an excellent source of essential amino acids and leucine, whey protein is increasingly in demand in the medical nutrition market. According to Innova Market Insights, the number of global medical nutrition beverage product launches featuring whey protein grew by 9.9% CAGR between 2012 and 2017.

However, Arla Foods Ingredients said the production of high-protein whey beverages comes with challenges; they can gel over time, taste can be compromised and, if the ingredient is not heat-stable, processing equipment can be blocked.

The new beverage prototype aims to overcome these challenges. Developed for medical nutrition manufacturers, it is UHT-stable and delivers 10% protein content, all of which comes from whey.

The concept utilises Arla Foods Ingredients’ Lacprodan DI-7325, a whey ingredient specially designed for medical nutrition. The ingredient is suitable for beverages containing minerals, and is said to maintain good viscosity (with no gelation over time) as well as good heat stability.

Inge Lise Povlsen, senior category manager at Arla Foods Ingredients, said: “There is increasing demand for low-volume medical nutritional food and beverages with high levels of high-quality protein. The excellent nutritional profile of whey protein makes it the perfect ingredient for this. But the fact is whey proteins can be challenging in beverages when concentration increases.

Echo’s designs tell English Tea Shop’s sustainability story through a new brand mark featuring the word ‘organic’, a mandala design celebrating sustainable ingredients, and a new teapot icon and in-pack illustrations highlighting the brand’s farm-to-cup story.

Hand-drawn lettering of the brand mark has been refined to make it easier to read, while on-pack wording is tighter and more direct, with more emphasis on the ingredients. Each pack also features the strapline ‘Your Tea Loving Community’.

English Tea Shop CEO Suranga Herath said: “Our brand has become synonymous with a taste and values that people want. We wanted to create a consistent visual identity across the globe, to help people recognise the products more easily, and during this process we’ve come to recognise that our farm-to-cup story is not simply an ethos we believe – it can become the unifying concept for the brand.”

He added: “Our rebrand goes beyond revitalising our packaging; it changes how we communicate and connect with all our customers. Our commitment to celebrating communities from farm to cup is absolutely central to who we are as a company, so it was very important to us that this comes across in our packaging and communications. That’s what Echo have delivered here and we can’t wait to show our new look and feel to our customers around the world.”

Nigel Ritchie, founding partner and creative director at Echo, added: “We chose those to reflect the Sri Lankan tradition of celebrating colour in all its glory.

The crunchy dark roasted peanut butter takes inspiration from the world of coffee and contains high-oleic peanuts that have been through a special slow-roasting technique.

Dark roasted is the third peanut butter from Whole Earth that uses high-oleic peanuts, which are said to contain around 30% more monosaturated fats than standard peanuts.

The new spread has been created to encourage people to use peanut butter in a variety of inventive ways, including a dip for fruits like apples and dates.

Wessanen UK said the versatile spread is the latest demonstration of Whole Earth’s commitment to extend the usage occasions of peanut butter beyond toast.

Kirstie Hawkins, Whole Earth brand controller at Wessanen UK, said: “Peanut butter is a flexible and nutritious natural ingredient that can be enjoyed in a number of different ways, from smoothies to porridge to curries. Our delicious new spread is for people who appreciate great taste above all else, and is particularly enjoyable when paired with fruit.

“With the intense and rich flavours of our new dark roasted spread, we’re encouraging people to experiment even more with how they use and enjoy peanut butter.”

She added: “Peanut butter’s profile continues to be on the rise, as more and more of us actively look to make healthier, active lifestyle choices.”

The new peanut butter is available in Waitrose stores in the UK with a recommended retail price of £3.40 for 340g.

The line is born from the success of Bayou Rum’s satsuma liqueur, which will cease and instead live under the Gator Bite brand.

Gator Bite is an artisanal blend of Bayou Rum, infused with either satuma oranges or black coffee. The satsuma variant is said to have a fresh, honey-like flavour, while the coffee liqueur has notes of hazelnut and toffee.

Lauren Ryan Kiyak, vice president of marketing at Stoli Group USA, said: “Satsuma has had a strong following for the last five years in the flavoured liqueurs category as a mixer and as a ‘shot occasion’.

“However, as we rebranded Bayou Rum to be a more premium, craft offering focused on its Louisiana roots, it simply didn’t fit. We see great potential for satsuma and now, coffee, to take on exuberant, fun personalities under the Gator Bite brand.”

Last year, Stoli Group affiliate SPI Group fully acquired Louisiana Spirits and its Bayou Rum brand.

The 30% ABV satsuma flavour has a suggested retail price of $16.99, while the 26% ABV coffee variant retails for $19.99. Both are sold in 750ml and 1-litre bottles in the US.

The brand’s pale rosé is sourced from outside Montpellier and the sauvignon blanc comes from Côtes de Gascogne. Both are said to be “dry, crisp, vegan and very swiggable”.

Nice is targeting the on-the-go drinking occasion with 250ml slimline cans, which are 100% recyclable.

London-based Nice is led by entrepreneurs Lucy Wright (co-founder of Cuckoo Bircher Muesli) and Jeremy May (formerly of Propercorn and Vita Coco). This depth of experience gave the pair the know-how to achieve £300,000 in funding from angel investors prior to launch.

Key players in this investment were Cassandra Stavrou and Ryan Kohn of Propercorn.

“Cassandra and I come across a lot of exciting food and drink businesses, but it’s often the simple ideas that really grab our attention,” said Kohn.

“Quality wine in a can that is accessible to all makes real sense to us, especially given Nice’s strong brand identity, convenience and environmental benefits. Jeremy was one of our early Propercorn employees, responsible for building our export business, so we have huge confidence in his tenacity and in Lucy and Jeremy’s proven track record as entrepreneurs.”

Tom Elliot of Sainsbury’s added: “Nice is quality wine in a can that has mass market appeal and is 100% recyclable, which made it a no-brainer to Sainsbury’s. We have seen fantastic growth in single formats and convenience, and this category has performed phenomenally in the US. We love the brand; the cans will really pop on-shelf.

“We were also impressed by the two very experienced and ambitious co-founders driving the business forward. We’re looking forward to seeing the reaction of our shoppers as we roll Nice out to 600 stores across the country. We think the convenience element will be especially promising for the picnicking and festival season.”

Full-year sales stood at €24.66 billion while operating income shrank 26.5% to €2.74 billion. Since April 2018, Danone has faced a consumer boycott in Morocco, which resulted in a €43 million decrease in recurring operating income last year.

Within its waters division, like-for-like sales were up 5.3%. In North America, Evian sales were up by more than 20%, including first acceleration benefits of the distribution agreement recently signed with Keurig Doctor Pepper in the US.

Like-for-like sales in the specialised nutrition unit rose 5.9%. However, in the fourth quarter, the company was hit by lower demand in China for infant formula products.

Danone CEO Emmanuel Faber said: “I am proud of the results achieved by our teams at Danone in 2018. Our company is becoming more agile every day. We keep adjusting our ways of working and delivering efficiency. And we adapt to the ever-changing world around us, as exemplified by the impressive acceleration of our innovation rate, supplying a quarter of our total sales in 2018 from only 16% two years ago, and our 40% growth in e-commerce last year.

“With specialised nutrition, waters and our global plant-based brands from WhiteWave continuing to post strong growth despite a very volatile environment, the year has seen the encouraging progress of our essential dairy and plant-based business in Europe, which stabilised in the fourth quarter last year. This could not have happened without the multi-faceted reinvention of Activia, which shows that after years of decline, embracing with no fear the new paradigms can turn around a large global brand.

“We are actually further delayering our organisation, as another step to move away from the pyramidal model that built the giant food companies of the past. With this, we are becoming the most localised of our peers, prepared to capture the underlying value of the biodiversity of local food cultures and agricultures in tune with the new eating and drinking paradigms.”

Last year, Danone revealed plans to triple the size of its plant-based business by 2025 by combining its position in the dairy industry with the high plant-based growth potential. The company is looking to grow plant-based sales from €1.7 billion to around €5 billion.

Ruby chocolate was created by Barry Callebaut after more than a decade of research and development, and the chocolate is said to be unique because its fresh berry fruitiness and reddish colour are naturally occurring.

Barry Callebaut’s stand was devoted to the ‘fourth chocolate’ and received a great deal of interest from visitors, while chocolate brands including Libeert, Heilemann and Witor’s showcased ruby chocolate products at the show.

Popova discussed the various applications that ruby chocolate can be used for, including pralines, tablets, biscuits, bakery and ice cream, with the chocolate pairing particularly well with fruit flavours such as raspberry and citrus flavours.

“Ruby chocolate is the biggest innovation in the chocolate industry in the past 80 years. It’s the kind of chocolate that unlocks new doors and opportunities in confectionery.

“It’s unique in taste and colour, and what’s particularly interesting is that the taste and the colour of the chocolate comes from the ruby bean and the unique processing method that Barry Callebaut applies to get it from bean to bar.”

“The most exciting combinations I’ve seen so far have in confectionery applications such as pralines and tablets. With pralines you can really create a very nice flavour pairing with citrus, raspberry, coconut etc … and if you layer it a bit it works really well. With the pralines for the future you can count on ruby chocolate.”

When asked whether Ruby chocolate can help cater to the growing demand for indulgent foods, Popova said: “Definitely there is a trend for more indulgent snacks, but more importantly consumers are looking for something that teases their curiosity, providing something that they don’t expect, something they are looking forward to discovering.”

“I would like to see ruby chocolate grow into the recognised fourth type of chocolate, available across a wide variety of applications and consumers know that there is dark, milk, white and there is ruby.”","Interview: Ruby chocolate, the food trend to watch out for?"

"Francisco Pedrosa, regional clean steam specialist at Spirax Sarco, explains why steam should be central to HACCP in food and beverages.","February 18, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/spirax-sarco-francisco.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/opinion-using-steam-correctly-in-haccp-based-manufacturing/,"Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a familiar term for those within the food and beverage industry. Less familiar is the idea that plant operators should include steam in their HACCP based approach. Francisco Pedrosa, regional clean steam specialist at Spirax Sarco, explains why steam should be central to HACCP in food and beverages.

For food and beverage manufacturers, the proactive management of quality and safety is already of paramount importance. Indeed, preventing contaminants from entering into the production process is the central aim of those following a HACCP based approach.

However, while HACCP may come as second nature to plant operators, it remains all too easy to bypass steam as a conduit through which contaminants could be introduced into the food processing chain – leaving the quality of the end product exposed to the risk of contamination.

Manufacturing quality

 Steam is as much a key ingredient in the production of the end product as the eggs, the sugar, or the milk. It is important therefore to remember that using the right grade of steam in the plant will have an impact on the quality of your end product.

Despite having passed through a fine stainless-steel filter, typically of five microns in size, the potential risk of both particulate contamination like rust, scale and other pipe debris and chemical contamination – from boiler chemicals or cross-contamination from other sources, such as Cleaning-in-Place (CIP) chemicals still remains.

Stainless-steel filters are not designed to remove suspended water droplets within the steam. Therefore, if the filter is unable to remove boiler carryover and other contaminants, they could still find their way through the filter, leading to possible process or product contamination – impacting the quality of the goods.

Keep it clean

 Plant managers questioning the alternatives could find benefits from introducing clean steam into the manufacturing process as a way of overcoming the potential contamination risks associated with filtered/culinary steam. Clean steam – though not mandatory in food and beverage manufacturing – is the highest grade of steam and is used as a standard in a range of quality-critical processes by many food manufacturers to ensure that the quality of their produce is not compromised.

To produce clean steam, a secondary generator is used which allows for the control of feedwater quality – eliminating the risk of water treatment chemical contamination. Investing in quality is second-nature to those within the food and beverage industry. Making the move from culinary steam to clean steam generation is an investment in ensuring repetitive and consistent steam quality of the end product at all times.

Those managing food production lines already have a sharp eye for quality and safety procedures. Introducing clean steam into your plant can give you total assurance in improving quality standards – making it a great deal easier to tick that all-important HACCP box.

Corrosion concerns

 Steam can collect contaminants along its journey in a plant – no matter how attentive to detail a plant manager is. If a plant is manufacturing goods in the UK, then they will already be aware of European guidelines which state that “steam used directly in contact with food is not to contain any substance that presents a hazard to health or is likely to contaminate food” (EC No. 852/2004).

Taking the next step

 Plant operators often lack the knowledge of how to include steam in HACCP approaches. By making use of a ‘walk the plant’ audit, for example, plant operators can take the opportunity to find and explore new ways of improving the quality of food and beverage products by assessing the role of steam in the manufacturing process. This is increasingly a requirement from major retailers who, along with manufacturers, are responsible for ensuring the safety and quality of the products they sell.",Opinion: Using steam correctly in HACCP-based manufacturing

The consumer desire for clean label and natural ingredients is increasing, as is the demand for plant-based ingredients, and Frerichs was keen to stress that the Coloring Foods range offered by its EXBERRY® brand can fulfil these requirements as they are exclusively made from fruits, vegetables, and edible plants.

EXBERRY® Coloring Foods can be used in a wide range of food and beverage applications from confectionery, enhanced waters, bakery products and more, providing vibrant and stable colours with easy-to-understand ingredients.

Frerichs also tells FoodBev that the company’s supply chain is completely vertically-integrated, allowing GNT to ensure the high quality of its range of colours from farm to fork.

According to Frerichs, colours inspired by sunshine – such as bright yellow through to deep orange – will be the main colour trend in 2019, as consumers seek out products that inspire upbeat, positive emotions.

“Consumers are becoming increasingly suspicious about the things that they eat and they really want transparency about the ingredients in their food, so it’s very important that you have a clean label and that the ingredients are easily understandable.

“By using Colouring Foods, you really have the most natural alternative [to artificial colourings] to bring colour into food.”

On the plant-based nature of the products, Frerichs said: “It’s a very important trend for us, as natural colourants such as carmine are made from insects and are not plant-based. Now we have solutions made from fruit and vegetables just by concentrating and you have the same colour shade in the food.

“Our supply chain is totally vertically-integrated. That means we have full control starting from the seeds through to the production where we make our concentrates using a physical manufacturing process.”

When asked about the key colour trends for 2019, Frerichs added: “We just launched a new campaign called Love Colour, and within this we think the key colour trend for 2019 will be the colour of sunshine.

“This starts with yellow going to orange and to orangey-red, so really happy shades which can be used in every application type.

“At the moment we have two key colour trends. Paler colours are becoming more popular so that the products look really natural, and on the other hand you have the desire for excitement where the consumer would like to be entertained by the things they eat. This had led to blue and other colour shades which are not that present in nature becoming more popular.”",Interview: GNT discusses EXBERRY's natural colour range

The company said each brew is made with ethically sourced, regenerative organics and undergoes in-house DNA testing to ensure safety and consistency.

Funding will allow the business to research and develop environmentally friendly packaging.

The round was led by KarpReilly, a US private investment firm with a portfolio of emerging brands including Spindrift, KeVita, Zola Coconut Water, and Iconic Protein. Other investors include Justin Gold and Brendan Synnott (co-founder of Bear Naked).

“We love Rowdy Mermaid Kombucha because its function-forward and science-based approach to kombucha stands out in a fast-growing industry,” said Allan Karp, co-founder of KarpReilly.

“We are confident in the tremendous amount of momentum Jamba and his team have received over the past several years in the Rocky Mountain region and we believe the organic harmony between our teams will compel a thoughtful growth strategy moving forward.”

Jamba Dunn, founder and CEO of Rowdy Mermaid Kombucha, added: “This financing allows the Rowdy Mermaid team the opportunity to grow our company and our product line with integrity.

“We believe functional health extends to the environment we live in as well as ourselves. Which is why a big initiative for 2019 will be a switch to clean supply chains and sustainable packaging to increase our presence and offerings while being mindful of environmental concerns – curbing production waste, extending shelf life and increasing the functionality of the product.”

The announcement follows a spike in recent new kombucha launches and investments. In, September, Coca-Cola entered the kombucha market with the acquisition of Organic & Raw Trading Co, which makes the Mojo brand kombucha drinks.

The UK government has launched consultations on the introduction of new plastic packaging taxes and tougher rules for packaging producers.,"February 19, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/plastic-bottles-388679_1920.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/uk-government-seeks-views-on-proposed-plastic-packaging-tax/,"The UK government has launched consultations on the introduction of new plastic packaging taxes and tougher rules for packaging producers, in a move towards a more circular economy.

Building on commitments made in the Resources and Waste Strategy published in December, new plans will see the costs of recycling borne by those that produce packaging waste.

It is estimated that packaging producers pay “around 10%” of the cost of dealing with packaging waste. By increasing that to cover the full amount, the government aims to incentivise producers to think carefully about using less packaging, and to switch to using packaging that is easier to recycle.

Last October, the government announced that from April 2022 it would introduce a new tax on the production and import of plastic packaging with less than 30% recycled content, subject to consultation.

It is now seeking views on proposals for how the tax will work. For example, which packaging should be in scope of the tax, how to assess recycled content, and which businesses will be liable for the tax. The consultation will run for 12 weeks.

Environment secretary Michael Gove said: “We are committed to going further and faster to reduce, reuse, recycle and cut waste. That’s why we are leading the way to move away from being a ‘throw-away’ society and drive up domestic recycling.

“Through our plans, we will introduce a world-leading tax to boost recycled content in plastic packaging, make producers foot the bill for handling their packaging waste, and end the confusion over household recycling.

“We are committed to cementing our place as a world leader in resource efficiency, so we can be the first generation to leave our environment in a better state than we inherited it.”

In a statement, The Foodservice Packaging Association said: “Defra and HM Treasury have given the opportunity for packaging waste management to shift up several gears and we must all work together ensure the huge increase in funding by business really will be used to deliver the opportunity and the best value and that this will be delivered across the UK.”

The government is also seeking views on introducing a deposit-return scheme for cans and bottles.

Two options have been suggested. The first, known as the ‘all-in’ model, would target a large amount of drinks beverages placed on the market, irrespective of size. The second option, known as the ‘on-the-go’ model, would restrict the drinks containers in scope to those less than 750ml in size and sold in single format containers.",UK government seeks views on proposed plastic packaging tax
"Kellogg, Accenture and Qualcomm have launched a solution that uses eye-tracking technology to determine the best way to stock shelves for retailers.","February 18, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Qualcomm2.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/kellogg-joins-collaboration-to-test-virtual-reality-retail-technology/,"Kellogg has partnered with Accenture and Qualcomm Technologies to develop a solution that embeds eye-tracking technology in a mobile virtual reality (VR) headset to determine the best way to stock shelves for retailers.

The Accenture Extended Reality (XR) practice developed the VR merchandising solution using a Qualcomm VR reference design headset.

The resulting experience immerses customers in a simulated store, enabling them to shop, pick up products and place them in carts – all while monitoring what they are looking at, for how long and why.

It has been designed to allow companies to extend their reach to more geographically dispersed participants and perform market research faster and on a larger scale.

Kellogg tested the solution as it launched its Pop Tarts Bites product. The companies said that the VR technology provided “far deeper”behavioural data than standard testing, which typically relies on online surveys and in-home user tests.

Rather than placing Pop Tarts Bites on higher shelves, which conventional testing indicated was where consumers expected to find new products, the VR solution demonstrated that optimal placement for the new product was on lower shelves. This led to an increase in brand sales of 18% during testing.

Jenny McDaniels, senior manager of category strategy at Kellogg Company, said: “When trying to best assess a future product’s shelf placement, this new methodology provided optimal guidance from both a product and category perspective. This approach provided multiple data outputs, which in turn, created a holistic solution that would drive success for both the category and product.”

Raffaella Camera, global head of innovation and market strategy at Accenture Extended Reality, said: “Our VR merchandising solution has the potential to transform product placement by examining consumer buying behaviour in a holistic way.

“By combining the power of VR with eye tracking and analytics capabilities, it allows significant new insights to be captured while consumers shop by monitoring where and how they evaluate all products across an entire shelf or aisle. Ultimately, this enables product placement decisions to be made that can positively impact total brand sales, versus only single product sales.”

Qualcomm Technologies senior director of business development Patrick Costello added: “XR provides transformative value to the enterprise. At Qualcomm Technologies, we develop foundational XR technology through our VR reference designs that are engineered to enable companies to evaluate and quickly launch devices.

“This proof of concept with Accenture and Kellogg Company demonstrates the benefits of full immersion and eye tracking and we expect several customers to follow with similar deployments.”",Kellogg joins collaboration to test virtual reality retail technology
Australian dairy company Bega Cheese has announced plans to build a new lactoferrin plant at its Koroit facility in Western Victoria.,"February 15, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/milk.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/bega-cheese-to-invest-24-1m-in-new-australia-lactoferrin-plant/,"Australian dairy company Bega Cheese has announced plans to build a new lactoferrin plant at its Koroit facility in Western Victoria.

The firm has secured a long-term lactoferrin supply agreement, which will support an investment of approximately AUD 34 million ($24.1 million) to establish the unit.

Lactoferrin is a naturally occurring iron-binding protein found in milk that is known for its anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and immunological properties.

Bega said that as a high-value and functional ingredient, lactoferrin is used globally in a range of consumer health and nutritional food products, including infant formula. The firm started manufacturing lactoferrin at its Tatura, Victoria, site in 2002.

Paul van Heerwaarden, Bega Cheese CEO, said: “The new lactoferrin plant will enable us to produce more than 35 tonnes of lactoferrin each year to be used in products such as infant formula and pharmaceuticals.

“This investment at Koroit will position Bega as one of the largest manufacturers of lactoferrin globally and is a major step forward in the growth of our bio-nutrients business.”

Bega bought the Koroit facility last year from Saputo for approximately AUD 250 million ($184 million). At the time, Bega said the purchase would significantly strengthen its milk processing operations.

As well as its cheese portfolio, Bega makes a range of dressings and dips under its Zoosh brand. This time last year, the firm secured a deal to buy the Vegemite spreads brand from Mondelēz International’s Australia and New Zealand business.",Bega Cheese to invest $24.1m in new Australia lactoferrin plant

PepsiCo turned over $64.66 billion in 2018, with steady growth in its Frito-Lay North America and ESSA (Europe and sub-Saharan Africa) segments offsetting smaller declines in Quaker Foods North America and AMENA (Asia, Middle East and North Africa).

For the final three months of the year – Laguarta’s first quarter as CEO – net revenue remained constant at $19.52 billion.

But despite the positive topline performance, operating profit fell by 2% across the whole of the business.

Laguarta replaced Indra Nooyi in October, 15 months after being appointed president of the company. He had previously been CEO of the (ESSA) division – the company’s third largest segment.

Its biggest business unit, North America Beverages, returned 1% revenue growth but endured a 16% contraction in operating profit – partly a result of higher transportation and commodity costs – in the results released today.

Ramon Laguarta said: “We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2018. For the year we met or exceeded each of the financial objectives we set out at the beginning of the year. Frito-Lay North America and each of our international sectors performed very well, and our North America Beverages sector made progress throughout the year.

“While adverse foreign exchange translation negatively impacted reported net revenue performance, our underlying organic revenue growth accelerated in the second half, and we ended the year with 4.6% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, we are excited about the outlook for our business. We are well positioned in large, growing categories and have developed strong and relevant capabilities over the years. In 2019, we aim to capitalise on the momentum we have as we enter the year, and to continue to invest in the capabilities that will better position us for success for years to come.”","Laguarta inherits a PepsiCo in good shape, 2018 results show"

Each is exempt from the UK’s soft drinks tax and contains zero sweeteners. CCEP said the line has a “clean, crisp and refreshingly light taste”.

The latest addition to the Appletiser portfolio will be sold in 250ml cans, designed to help food-on-the-go operators to maximise the increased demand for canned beverages, CCEP said.

The launch will be supported by a marketing campaign across digital, social media and out of home, as well as sampling activity.

Simon Harrison, vice president of commercial development at CCEP GB, said: “Appletiser has achieved strong growth in 2018, up 30% in retail sales value and this is largely due to the rising demand for adult soft drinks, as consumers look for delicious, alcohol-free alternatives.

“Appletiser Spritzer is a natural, light-tasting, sparkling fruit drink that will attract younger consumers to the Appletiser brand by catering to a variety of drinking occasions.

“The 250ml can format is designed to be enjoyed both on the go, or as a refreshing accompaniment to a meal, and demonstrates how we continue to energise our leading brands on our journey to becoming a total beverage company.”",Coca-Cola European Partners unveils Appletiser Spritzer line

European WaterCare has opened a new filter recycling centre at its headquarters and launched a new water filter recycling unit called WaterCare Recycling...,"February 22, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Water-1.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/european-watercare-launches-new-filter-recycling-unit/,"European WaterCare has opened a new filter recycling centre at its headquarters and launched a new water filter recycling unit called WaterCare Recycling.

The launch of WaterCare Recycling comes as European WaterCare seeks to minimise plastic waste from single-use filters and recycle/repurpose material straight back into the manufacturer of new products, creating a circular economy for filters.

WaterCare Recycling can recycle expired or unwanted filters from a range of major brands, including Brita, BWT, and 3M.

The recycling process occurs in three stages. Firstly, the filters are disassembled and sorted into plastic and aluminium and washed, and the aluminium is recycled.

Next, the expired resin is extracted from the filters, drained, de-humidified and sieved to separate the carbon and Ion exchange beads ‘resetting’ the resin beads for use in new water filters.

Finally, the plastics are sorted and cleaned before being ground into plastic pellets, which can then be used to manufacture internal parts for new water filters.

A statement from European Watercare said: “Building on our core philosophy of providing the most eco-friendly water treatment products available on the market today, it was a natural decision to progress this and develop a new area of our business dedicated to the recycling and re-purposing of all water filters.

“Therefore, we are now able to recycle and re-purpose all types of plastic and aluminium water filters using our newly operational recycling facility at our head offices in Harlow, Essex.

“We are also able to regenerate the expired resin from within these water filters to be used in future manufacture of new water filters.”",European WaterCare launches new filter recycling unit

Each will further commitments in moving towards a sustainable supply chain.

The Sustainable Soy Policy responds to concerns surrounding the production of soy in its contribution to deforestation. It outlines how Cargill will aim to ‘promote responsible production’ to positively impact on farmers and surrounding communities. Transparency will also be a key part to Cargill’s Soy Policy, through reporting of key metrics, progress and grievances.

Improvements to the supply chain are also addressed in the company’s updated Forest Policy by mapping the origin of goods, employing risk assessment to reduce levels of deforestation, and measuring progress across the supply chain.

Dave MacLennan, Cargill chairman and CEO said: “Farming and forests can – and must – co-exist.

“The world depends on agriculture to feed a growing population but also depends on the long-term viability of our natural resources. Leading sector-wide transformation means we can innovate, challenge what is possible and ensure that people and the planet have what they need for generations to come.”

Cargill will also work alongside industry partners, direct and indirect suppliers, customers, governments and farmer groups in order to deliver on commitments, the company said.

David Cleary, director of global agriculture at The Nature Conservancy, a charitable environmental organisation, commented on Cargill’s approach to improving the supply chain: “For more than 15 years, we have worked with Cargill and producers in Brazil to promote sustainable agricultural practice and protect forests.

“Comprehensive sustainability policies combined with action on the ground will help ensure we sustain natural landscapes, not only today but for years to come. There has been good progress but work must continue to end deforestation.”",Cargill launches further commitments to sustainability

The expansion represents EHL’s third unit at the facility, taking its total space up to 40,000 square feet.

The unit houses new machinery, including a vertical form filler, which fills pillow bags and tubs for dried herbs and spices, seeds and powders. EHL said it is responding to an increase in customer requests and from existing clients placing larger orders.

Tasneem Alonzo, joint managing director at EHL Ingredients, said: “We’ve outgrown our capacity in terms of storage, staff, machinery, administration and loading areas, so needed a space to allow us to expand the business longer term. We decided to stay on the same industrial estate instead of moving our whole premises, so when this unit came up we were keen to review it.

“Over the last 12 months, we’ve been taking orders for larger quantities which means we need to increase capacity. This new site will allow us to process more orders and higher volumes, more efficiently and quickly and the installation of the new machinery will enhance production and allow us to continue to innovate further.

“The food ingredient sector is certainly in a period of growth and with the rise in popularity of organic, free-from, vegan and vegetarian foods, we’re continuously innovating to bring retailers, brands, manufacturers and caterers the right ingredients to suit consumer trends.

“Despite the uncertain times we are in, we’re confident in our position as a company. We’ve strengthened our teams, developed many new herb and spice blends, broadened our product portfolio and expanded our customer base into new territories, especially in Scandinavia.”

The study revealed that 39% of consumers think retailers should be made to have a plastic-free aisle in every store. More than a quarter (29%) go further and believe every store should be completely plastic-free.

When considering the use of compostable packaging formats – packaging that breaks down completely and leaves no trace on the environment – almost half (46%) of UK consumers say they think compostable packaging is under-utilised by brands.

Likewise, nearly half (49%) of shoppers would welcome the introduction of labelling to identify that packaging is compostable.

When asked about flexible plastic packaging, used for many single-use products which are mostly non-recyclable, more than half (54%) of British shoppers say they check labelling before throwing these items in the regular refuse bin. However, confusion still exists in certain quarters as more than one in five consumers (21%) admit to throwing flexible packaging in the recycling bin because they didn’t know it wasn’t eligible for recycling.

Tipa CEO Daphna Nissenbaum said: “It’s great to see that public yearning is driving the service industry to rethink its relationship with flexible plastic packaging, which is often non-recyclable. We’re now at a point where people better understand the damage of plastic waste and are keen to reduce their carbon footprint but aren’t always sure how best to go about it.

“This often leads people to play it safe with packaging they aren’t sure is recyclable, due to unclear or unlabelled packaging, and end up using the wrong receptacles. This can cause unnecessary strain on recycling centres that have to sift through hundreds of tonnes of non-recyclable matter.”

She added: “The majority of people just want to do the right thing in a way that fits their busy lives. It is therefore incumbent on stakeholders in retail, groceries and the wider supply chain to clearly demarcate which packaging is plastic-free and which is suitable for recycling. By supporting consumers in this way, they will inspire greater brand trust among a public whose conscientiousness with plastic waste is only going to grow further in the future.”

"At ProSweets 2019, FoodBev Media spoke with Döhler about the creation of multi-sensory experiences for food and beverages...","February 22, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dohler-interview1.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/dohler-discusses-the-creation-of-multi-sensory-experiences/,"At ProSweets 2019, FoodBev Media spoke with Stefanie Engel, Döhler’s marketing manager B2C food, about the creation of multi-sensory experiences for food and beverages.

At the show, Döhler showcased a number of concepts which utilised natural flavours, such as the newly-developed “switcher gums”, fruit gums which combined two different flavours, with a sweet vanilla coating making way to a sour rhubarb centre when chewing the gum.

Engel said that the multi-sensory experience provided by concepts such as the switcher gums can appeal to consumers as they provide a unique taste experience, while also enhancing the taste experience of more traditional foods.

“Our concepts at the show are basically on the topic of the multi-sensory experience and nutritional excellence, and what we particularly want to promote our switcher fruit gums, made from a pectin base but they can also be made from a jelly base.

“We use a liquid flavour on the inside and a powder flavour on the outside, giving you a really interesting experience where when you put it into your mouth you have a certain taste, and when you bite into it you get a different taste, so the taste switches during consumption.”

When asked about the challenges which come with formulating multi-sensory flavours, Engel said: “First of all, the question is do you want to go with plant-based or not plant-based, that’s why we always offer a gelatine and a pectin-based product.

“Then it really depends on the market. Taste demands are different all over the world … and we try to find to find out what is most suitable for relevant markets.”

On plant-based products, Engel said: “For us, plant-based is a natural topic, throughout history we’ve always worked with natural and plant-based products, but now we find that large numbers of consumers want to avoid dairy and animal products and of course we offer a range of alternatives.

“We always look to create the best taste, but also for an ethical, ‘clean’ version of a product. You have to show both options, and if it’s combinable and the plant-based version has a great taste then we are fine with that.”",Interview: Döhler discusses multi-sensory experiences

Bimbo highlighted the strong performance in both its Mexico and North America units.

Daniel Servitje, Grupo Bimbo CEO, said: “We closed the year with record-breaking levels of net sales, gross profit, operating income and adjusted EBITDA, positioning us as a stronger and leaner company that will continue to create value and serve our consumers.”

Glanbia’s focus at the show was directed at the healthy snacking space, and the company showcased three high-protein bar concepts at the show, two of which aimed to demonstrate that high protein content can be delivered in a classic confectionary style bar.

Glanbia also showcased two multivitamin gummy concepts developed in collaboration with Swiss supplement company Domeco, which used Glanbia’s multivitamin premixes to provide a range of benefits, such as the support of immune health.

O’Mahoney told Foodbev that the growth of the healthy snacking space has offered a new route to market for confectionery producers offering healthier options, and that Glanbia’s expertise makes it a reliable solution provider for manufacturers operating in the confectionery space and beyond.

“As healthy nutrition is going more mainstream, consumers are demanding that products taste really good, they don’t want to compromise on taste and texture and as solution providers that presents challenges.

“The bar concepts we’re showing offer high-quality taste and mouthfeel … so consumers regard these products as high-quality and they aren’t compromising and I think that’s the key.

“We really understand products, understand their chemistry and understand the science behind them, and we fraction products into different components and understand how they actually work together.

“In addition to that, customers are looking for long-term working relationships, and we supply high-quality products on a consistent basis, and I think customers need that as changing suppliers can cost companies because you can get differing functionality and different quality.”",Interview: Healthy snacking a key trend for Glanbia Nutritionals

The factory predominantly produces glass bottles for premium wine producers in the Champagne, Burgundy, Loire Valley regions in France.

This investment will pay for all-new high-tech equipment, a new overall layout, and additional technical innovations, allowing O-I to produce bottles in three colours and in sizes ranging from 0.2-litres to Magnum-size.

The project includes the complete renewal of one of the plant’s two furnaces, as well as the addition of all-new industrial equipment on the attached production lines. The upgrade is expected to be completed by mid-2019.

The company claims that the equipment and furnace is more energy efficient than the equipment previously at the site, further reducing its environmental footprint.

O-I will also hire approximately 30 new employees in Reims to further strengthen the capability of the plant.

Francois Pierrot, country group executive, Southwest Europe, for O-I said: “This is a strategic investment to strengthen our position in the Champagne business.

“We will be able to serve our customers in the premium segment even better with improved flexibility at the plant and within O-I’s overall manufacturing network in France.”

The range, which represents the first global launch for Froneri, targets the adult evening snack occasion, where indulgent sticks have seen a growth of 25% year on year, according to the company.

Four flavours have been introduced across Europe: salted caramel and Australian macadamia, dark chocolate and Nordic berry, cookies and Idaho valley mint, and almond and Java vanilla.

Each stick is made with cream, coated in a thick layer of chocolate and “a more artisanal finish”. Froneri said the cocoa used in Nuii products supports responsible, sustainable cocoa farming.

Charlotte Hambling, UK head of marketing at Froneri, said: “The indulgent sticks sector continues to drive growth in both ice cream and the wider grocery market. However, there’s a real gap to add incremental growth by appealing to the adventure seeking, taste discerning audience who are looking for a premium stick that fulfils their indulgent treat requirements for an evening snack.

“Nuii takes premium indulgence to the next level. The quality of the ingredients we have sourced and the artisanal finish conveys the care and attention that goes into every one of the Nuii sticks.”

To support the launch of the new brand, Froneri is investing £3 million in an integrated marketing campaign to run throughout 2019.

UK-headquartered Dairy Crest manufactures and markets cheese, butter, spreads and oils under brands such as Cathedral City, Clover, Country Life and Frylight. It employs around 1,100 people in seven locations across the UK.

For the year ended 31 March 2018, Dairy Crest had revenues of approximately £456.8 million and profit after tax of £149.5 million.

Montreal-based Saputo said Dairy Crest is “a well-established and successful industry player with a solid asset base and an experienced management team”, adding that the Dairy Crest portfolio fits with its growth strategy.

In 2015, Dairy Crest sold its dairy unit to Müller in a deal worth £80 million. The division made the ready-to-drink flavoured milk brand Frijj, cream, bulk butter and milk powders.

Last year, Dairy Crest revealed a £75 million expansion of its creamery in Davidstow, Cornwall. The company said the investment will boost growth of its Cathedral City and Davidstow cheese brands, increase whey production and reduce the facility’s environmental impact.

One of the world’s top ten dairy processors, Saputo agreed a CAD 1.29 billion ($1 billion) to buy Australia’s struggling dairy business Murray Goulburn in 2017 – taking on 2,300 employees and 11 manufacturing facilities in Australia and China.

It has since bought US goat’s cheese manufacturer Montchevre and speciality cheeses and yogurts maker Shepherd Gourmet Dairy.

Last November, the company revealed plans to build a new dairy processing facility in Port-Coquitlam, Canada, in a move to expand its business in western Canada.

"Stephen Noblett, food and drink sector specialist at the Department for International Trade, explores how to capitalise on the surge in UK gin exports.","February 21, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gin-exports.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/opinion-capitalising-on-the-surge-in-uk-gin-exports-for-the-future/,"HMRC and the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) have reported record numbers for UK gin exports, and the industry has reflected this in the rise of popularity of such products, seen in the pink drinks trend.

How should companies capitalise on these figures, and what examples can be taken forward for the rest of the alcohol sector?

FoodBev spoke with Stephen Noblett, food and drink sector specialist at the Department for International Trade, to explore how British gin makers are capitalising on the global ‘ginnaissance’.

What are the fundamental reasons for the rise in UK gin exports?

UK gin producers are world-renowned for their quality. With the ‘ginnaissance’ boosting the spirit’s popularity globally, more consumers are looking for high-quality gin than ever before. Gin distillers across the UK, both large and small, are capitalising on the ‘ginnaissance’ and are taking their products to be enjoyed by new consumers around the world.

At the beginning of 2018, there were 315 distilleries in Britain, more than double the number operating five years previous.

The growth in distilleries here is evidence of increased interest and demand for gin. And as the British gin industry is supported by the historical tradition of making the spirit, global gin drinkers look to the UK’s heritage and artisanship to find their top-quality tipple.

Where does this figure place the UK globally for the gin market?

The UK is the world’s largest exporter of gin – according to the WSTA, three out of four bottles of gin imported around the world come from our shores – and our dominance in the market is growing. During the past year, our gin exports grew to £612 million, up 15% on the previous year.

This is part of a growing trend, with our exports of the spirit more than doubling since 2010. It’s clear that this is due to global taste for our gin.

Which regions are the most interested in UK gin? Can you say why this is?

According to the most recent WSTA statistics released in partnership with HMRC, the United States is the largest single importer of British gin, with sales reaching £191 million last year, up £13 million from 2017.

Despite being a smaller overall market size, the most impressive growth in demand for UK gin has been in South Africa, with the country importing 222% more British gin in 2018 than the previous year. Another notable increase comes from Australia, where imports of UK gin doubled from 2017 to 2018.

It’s clear that these markets are interested in our gin and that our distillers offer a wide range of products across different tastes and price points.

Do you see growth being fostered in other areas of the industry, such as beer and cider exports?

The rise in demand for gin comes at a special moment for the spirit. Consumers are rediscovering classic gin-based cocktails, adding new twists to them and reimagining the use for the spirit in its entirety. For example, a traditional gin and tonic has been elevated with new premium and craft gins mixed with fun and reimagined tonics.

However, the increased demand for British products is not for gin alone. While gin exports are higher than our beer exports, we are witnessing a rise in exports across a number of traditional UK beverages and spirits, with beer and cider being no exception.

Last year we saw British cider makers exporting to over 50 countries around the world. It’s clear that demand for UK-made beverages is up because the world wants our high-quality drinks.

Is it accurate to say that the rise in UK start-ups and craft alcohol has contributed to the rise in gin exports?

Small distillers from across the UK have been crucial to growing the country’s gin market growth. With sales of artisan brands in a major UK supermarket chain up 167% as compared to mass-produced brands rising 30%, it’s evident that smaller, artisanal gin companies are making a clear contribution toward growth in gin sales.

These smaller distillers have greatly added to the richness of our gin market, continuing to keep the UK a global leader in developing high-quality gins that consumers want.

One UK craft distiller that has taken advantage of global demand for our gin is the Cotswolds Distillery, which has seen its export sales grow by 350% since it began exporting in 2015.

To achieve this impressive growth, the company received help from the Food is Great campaign, working with a DIT International Trade Adviser to help navigate the exporting process. After focusing on the US market for its initial foray into exporting, the company now ships its gin to 28 markets around the world including to Australia and Hong Kong.

If the Cotswolds Distillery can achieve export growth success, other British companies can too. For companies curious about exporting, I would suggest that they get in touch with their local DIT office.

Could the health and wellness trend of low-ABV alcohols impact on future gin export figures?

We’re seeing growth in both traditional and new sectors, with British producers embracing both types of products. Whether low-ABV or traditional products, our heritage for quality means that there is a great opportunity for our products around the world.",Opinion: Capitalising on the surge in UK gin exports for the future

Approximately 1,100 employees work in the company’s current location in Plano, which it has occupied since 1998.

KDP CEO Bob Gamgort said: “We are excited to upgrade our Texas co-headquarters location to support the needs of our vibrant business, including enhanced technology capabilities and space to increase collaboration.

“The new location at The Star in Frisco will provide a state-of-the-art work environment and exciting amenities that will energise our employees and enable us to attract top talent in the area.”

The announcement follows a vote by the Frisco Economic Development Corporation (FEDR) board of directors approving an incentive package tied to certain performance criteria.

FEDR president Ron Patterson said: “Keurig Dr Pepper’s decision to locate here is a huge win for the city and residents of Frisco. This move will drive job growth opportunities, as well as create interest from other corporations across the nation seeking to expand and relocate their operations. As more companies move to Frisco, our residents and business community will continue to benefit.”

"Increased cannabis consumption in the US “poses a long-term risk” to the alcohol industry, according to new research from the IWSR and BDS Analytics.","February 22, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cannabis.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/cannabis-poses-long-term-risk-to-us-alcohol-industry-research/,"Increased cannabis consumption in the US “poses a long-term risk” to the alcoholic beverage industry, according to new research from the IWSR and BDS Analytics.

Though legal cannabis is currently only a fraction of comparable alcohol sales, the study shows that the risk to beverage alcohol is expected to expand as cannabis acceptance and consumption grows, particularly among beer and spirits drinkers.

The report also notes that millennial consumers represent 45% of ‘dualists’ (those who consume both cannabis and alcohol), which it says is a “sobering statistic” for alcohol companies who are trying to maintain sales in this important demographic.

Titled ‘Beverage Alcohol, Cannabis and the Changing U.S. Consumer: What are the Real Risks and Opportunities to Consumption Behavior?’, the report is an initiative between IWSR Drinks Market Analysis and BDS Analytics, the consumer research analysts in the fields of beverage alcohol and cannabis respectively.

The US cannabis industry has surged in recent years – ten states have now approved adult recreational use of cannabis products and 34 states have approved cannabis for medicinal purposes.

Jessica Lukas, vice-president of BDS Analytics, said: “Our research shows that up to 40% of adults 21 and over consume cannabis in states where it’s legal. Cannabis presents substantial opportunities across consumer industries, including new occasions that alcohol cannot and will not play.

“Consumers will continue to look to cannabis products over alcohol for occasions when they are feeling creative, need to get motivated, or seeking health, medical or wellness benefits.”

Brandy Rand, IWSR US president, added: “Though not yet mainstream, cannabis adoption is certainly growing in states where it’s legal and does pose a risk to the beverage alcohol industry in the future.

“It’s important that alcohol brands pay attention to their consumers, recognising that some occasions may result in a decrease in alcohol consumption in place of, or alongside, legal cannabis.”

The news follows a study by the Distilled Spirits Council published last month, which suggested that spirits sales have not been negatively impacted in the three US states that have legalised recreational cannabis the longest.

It revealed that since recreational cannabis was legalised, spirits sales grew in Colorado by 7.6%, in Washington state by 5.4% and in Oregon by 3.6%.

Distilled Spirits Council chief economist David Ozgo said: “Simply put, the data show there has been no impact on spirits sales from recreational marijuana legalisation.”",Cannabis ‘poses long-term risk’ to US alcohol industry – research

The company wrote down the value of assets including its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands by $15 billion. As a result of the poor figures, CFO David Knopf said the firm now “expects to take a step backwards in 2019”.

Following the initial SEC request, the company launched an investigation into the procurement area. In the fourth quarter of 2018, as a result of findings from the investigation, Kraft Heinz recorded a $25 million increase to costs of products sold, but said it does not expect the matter to be material to the current or past quarters.

Kraft Heinz said regulators are investigating matters “including, but not limited to, agreements, side agreements, and changes or modifications to its agreements with its vendors”.

For the year, the company’s net sales rose 0.7% to $26.26 billion, despite a dip in performance in the US – a market which makes up more than two-thirds of revenue. Losses for the year stood at $10.23 billion.

In an earnings call, Knopf revealed the company is considering selling off additional assets. Last October, it offloaded a range of its Indian brands, including children’s milk drink Complan, to Zydus Wellness for around INR 46 billion ($628 million).

It has since acquired US condiments and sauces brand Primal Kitchen for approximately $200 million.

Kraft Heinz CEO Bernardo Hees said: “Our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results reflect our commitment to reestablish commercial growth of our iconic brands, turn around consumption trends in several key categories, and expand into new category and geographic whitespaces.

“We are pleased with those actions, the returns on our investments, and the momentum built for 2019. However, profitability fell short of our expectations due to a combination of unanticipated cost inflation and lower-than-planned savings.

“Going forward, our global focus will remain on leveraging our in-house capabilities, developing our talented people, and delivering top-tier growth at industry-leading margins.”","Kraft Heinz posts full-year loss, writes down value of key brands"

Hansen has commercialised a new vegetable variety – the Hansen sweet potato Ipomoea batatas – using traditional breeding methods to create a natural red alternative to carmine.

The product is the result of the Danish company’s decade-long breeding programme.

“For the first time, we’ve created a whole new variety of vegetable to create the natural colour our customers are asking for,” said Jakob Dalmose Rasmussen, vice president of commercial development at Chr. Hansen Natural Colors.

“We call it the Hansen sweet potato. Over ten years ago, we discovered a promising pigment in a root vegetable’s tuber, but the plant’s pigment content was on the low side. We took this plant and embarked on a process of selective breeding using traditional, non-GMO methods. The result is a plant-based, brilliant red that gives our customers a natural alternative to carmine and synthetic colours.”

Luc Ganivet, vice president of innovation and application at Chr. Hansen Natural Colors, said: “It all starts with the right raw material. Our plant scientists spent years cultivating and selecting generation after generation of seedlings. We partnered with growers to learn the best ways to plant, nurture and harvest the Hansen sweet potato. And we perfected methods of handling, transportation and extraction. The result is the Hansen sweet potato with its unique combination of high-yield, brilliant colour and high per-plant pigment load.”

The Hansen sweet potato is the basis for Chr. Hansen’s recently launched FruitMax line of bright red solutions, which can be used in confectionery, water ice, bakery and bakery decorations, fruit preparation and fermented milk products.

Dalmose Rasmussen added: “Strawberry red is a popular shade for food products – from cakes to confectionary to milkshakes. But until now it has been nearly impossible to make a fire-engine red colour with no risk of off-taste without using carmine.

“And as consumers move towards vegetarian and vegan food choices, the need for a carmine alternative has become more pressing.

"We spoke with Tom Szaky, CEO of Terracycle, about new digital reusing scheme, Loop, and how this may impact sustainability efforts for the future.","February 22, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tom-szaky.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/digital-reusing-schemes-is-this-the-future-of-sustainability/,"Achieving a long-term solution for a circular economy is crucial for the entire industry, and many consumers take sustainability into consideration when making purchasing decisions. In order to use this consumer behaviour for the benefit of the industry, one way forward could be to involve the consumer directly in the re-using process.

To make this more accessible for consumers, digital reusing schemes are becoming more popular amongst companies. One of the most recent schemes to be announced is Loop, which directly links brands, retailers, and consumers to make the reusing process more efficient through the use of technology.

We spoke with Tom Szaky, CEO of Terracycle, about the company’s new scheme and how this may impact sustainability efforts for the future.

How far away are we in terms of finding completely sustainable solutions to waste?

Waste is now a world-wide global crisis that has been growing for over half a century. Consumers, big corporations and governments are becoming increasingly aware of the challenges due to waste and disposability. This is a huge first step.

Every day, more disposable material gets put into the ocean and landfills, so no matter how much we clean the ocean or recycle we’re never going to solve the problem. To us, the root cause of waste is not plastic, it’s using things once, and that’s really what Loop tries to change as much as possible.

Is convenience the answer to creating a circular economy?

Disposability is convenient so if a circular solution is not, it might not work in the long run. Circular systems need to offer consumers an experience that is as good – if not better – than linear models.

With digital reusing schemes, consumers have access to a convenient shopping experience that enables them to receive their favourite products at home in durable and premium packaging.

How does Loop impact the packaging industry for food and beverages?

Nowadays, when a consumer buys the product, they also buy the packaging, when what they need is just the product. With Loop, consumers will no longer own the packaging. Instead, it becomes an asset for the brand, which is an incentive for manufacturers to invest and design very durable containers that can be washed and reused many times.

In this perspective, brands can invest in developing packaging with better features. For example, in the US, the Häagen-Dazs container exclusively designed for Loop can keep the ice cream frozen longer.

How long will it take for reusing schemes to become mainstream?

We’ve had a very positive response from the public. I think the world is ready for schemes like this, because consumers and manufacturers have come to realise that recycling is critically important to help a symptom, but it is not going to solve waste at the root cause.

Will Loop become an in-store solution, and how does this change the face of shopping for food and beverages?

We are working with retailers in each of our launch markets. Carrefour in France, Tesco in the UK and a yet-to-be-named retailer in the US.

Loop’s retail partners are integrating the Loop engine into their e-commerce and later physical retail environments, effectively creating true “packaging free” aisles or sections.

In these models, the retailer purchases the Loop products from the manufacturers and sells them to the consumers. Partners also support recollecting the used packaging through a variety of methods (from direct pick up from consumers to store drop off).

Is digitalisation key to creating better solutions for reusable schemes like Loop?

Digitalisation is key for implementing circular solutions because it enables the platform to be convenient for consumers and easy to access from anywhere – unlike products that are only available in local stores.

Will Loop work alongside local recycling organisations, or is this a standalone service?

Loop is a standalone service. Disposable items available on Loop will be recycled by TerraCycle, not through kerbside municipal systems.

At the moment, is Loop restricted to the European market?

For now, Loop will be launched in Paris and NY in Spring 2019. Loop is planning to scale by adding more consumers to each active geography as well as expanding to new geographies in late 2019-2020, including London, Toronto, California, and Tokyo.",Digital reusing schemes: is this the future of sustainability?
"At ProSweets 2019, FoodBev Media spoke with Gerhard Schubert managing director Marcel Kiessling about the company's Lightline series of machinery...","February 25, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Schubert-interview.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/interview-gerhard-schubert-showcases-its-lightline-series/,"At ProSweets Cologne 2019, FoodBev Media spoke with Gerhard Schubert managing director Marcel Kiessling about the company’s Lightline series of packaging machinery.

Schubert’s Lightline Flowpacker was the company’s primary focus at ProSweets, and the Flowpacker on show featured Schubert’s newly-developed variable cross-sealing unit, which guarantees constant sealing times at variable chain speeds while gently packaging heat-sensitive products such as chocolate.

The Lightline series includes three variants, the Flowpacker, Cartonpacker and Pickerline, all of which are preconfigured, compact solutions equipped with Schubert’s automated robotic technology, capable of packaging a wide range of products efficiently.

The Flowpacker exhibited at ProSweets was capable of packing 250 products every minute, and the machine featured a 3D image processing system to ensure that only flawless products were processed and packed.

Kiessling told FoodBev: “Lightline stands for machines that are pre-configured. They are somewhat standardised as opposed to the machines we build for very complex packaging applications.

“I think this is probably the only machine on the market where we have fully integrated a flow wrapping with a picker line, so compared to conventional layouts with flow-wrapping machines it saves more space and that means lower costs.”

When asked about the specific benefits offered by a pre-configured machine, Kiessling said: “If your application fits into the configurations offered by the Lightline series, there is no engineering effort at all, it means we push a button, generate a bit of material and then we can start building the machine. This allows us to pass those lower costs onto our customers.”

When asked about the patented cross-selling technology, Kiessling said: “The issue when hot sealing flow wraps with heat sensitive products is that the chain speed could slow down, which may lead to heat build-up which could destroy the seal of the foil.

“That is impossible with our new technology because we keep the sealing time constant, even when there are changes in chain speed. So even for heat-sensitive products such as chocolate, it’s the perfect solution.”",Interview: Gerhard Schubert showcases its Lightline series

As part of the deal, the companies have entered into a multi-year supply agreement for certain ingredients used in SunOpta’s consumer products business.

The specialty and organic soy and corn business formed part of SunOpta North America-based raw material sourcing and supply segment and includes five facilities: four located in Minnesota and one in Iowa.

SunOpta said it will continue to operate its other North America-based sourcing and supply operations, consisting of sunflower and roasting operations, as well as its Europe-based international sourcing and supply platform, known as Tradin Organic, which were not part of the sale.

John Ruelle, senior vice president of raw material sourcing and supply at SunOpta, said: “Our specialty and organic soy and corn business has a long history of supplying high-quality specialty, non-GMO and organic ingredients to the food industry.

“I want to thank all of our employees who are transitioning to Pipeline Foods for their hard work and dedication. Each employee has had a meaningful impact and contributed to the company’s value creation plan during their time at SunOpta. We believe Pipeline Foods is well positioned in this space, which should serve the industry well and be positive for our transitioning employees.”

Pipeline Foods chief executive Eric Jackson added: “We are excited by this incredible opportunity to grow our business and expand the accessibility of organic and specialty grains in the US. With this move, we are merging the newest team in the sustainable agriculture supply chain business with the most tenured and respected team in the business, and creating something even better.

“With a focused passion, we seek to merge the best parts of each organisation’s culture, practices, experience, and relationships to build a world-class business that can deliver value to our farmer-partners as well as our customers.”

Carbery, which makes the Dubliner Cheese brand, said it is responding to increased market growth and consumer demand for mozzarella and other cheese varieties in emerging markets.

Located in Ballineen, County Cork, the plant will allow the firm to harness the “significant increase” in cheese consumption in Asian markets.

The new production facility will also expand milk production capacity at the site, which will have the capacity to process 4 million litres of milk a day.

It is expected construction of the plant will be completed in early 2020.

Speaking of the investment, Carbery CEO Jason Hawkins said: “Product and market diversification has always been a core part of our business and ongoing strategy, with this project in the planning for almost two years. As a global organisation, we are constantly looking to international consumption trends to further grow our offering and our business.

“Cheese such as mozzarella provide us with a more diversified product range and an opportunity to build a stronger foothold in new and emerging cheese markets such as Asia and the Middle East, while also providing us with a new product range and market opportunities in sectors such as foodservice.”

Peter Truby, vice president of marketing at Elmhurst, said: “Elmhurst 1925 is passionate about leading the plant-based milk category with on-trend innovation, and given the explosive growth of the hemp category, we’re excited to announce the industry’s first hemp creamer.

“Crafted simply with just four ingredients, including real hemp cream that’s produced from hemp grown on our own fields, original unsweetened hemp creamer is the first in a line of on-trend varieties we plan to introduce, starting at Expo West.”

The new unsweetened milked oats will also be launched at the Expo West trade show in early March. It is described as the counterpart to Elmhurst’s milked oats beverage but without sugar.

Made with three ingredients – oats, water and salt – the drink is free from added gums or oils and contains 20g of whole grains. Elmhurst said the product is suitable for drinking by the glass, stirring into oatmeal and mixing into smoothies.

Both the unsweetened hemp creamer and unsweetened milked oats are crafted through the HydroRelease method. Using just water, this process separates the components of a nut, grain or seed before reassembling them as a creamy, beverage-ready emulsion, maintaining the full nutrition of the source ingredient without added gums or emulsifiers.

Consisting of four variants – tomato, pumpkin, vegetable and courgette – the line has been launched in France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

Anthem said ambient soup supermarket aisles across mainland Europe are a “sea of sameness”. Knorr’s mission was to disrupt this uniformity with a new range of 100% natural ambient soups using simple ingredients to be packaged in glass bottles. Moving into glass packaging allows the brand to contribute to Unilever’s sustainability mission.

Anthem strove to create a design that mirrors the simplicity of the recipes and supports the naturalness of the products. It describes the packaging as “clean and uncluttered”, to both support the product message and also achieve stand out on shelf.

Taking inspiration from the chilled juice category, the agency used a shrink sleeve to amplify freshness cues. Meanwhile, the integration of illustrations with transparent windows looks to bring a new level of authenticity to the products.

Marie Leroy, Knorr Soups brand manager at Unilever, said: “Working with Anthem helped us tap into new ways of thinking and approaching design – what it means and how it’s perceived by consumers.

“We wanted to really revolutionise the way Knorr communicates on pack without losing recognition, focused on communicating naturalness and freshness which consumers are really searching for. The new designs hit all our objectives – achieving fantastic stand out, especially in France.”

The facility, which is situated in a 400-year-old building, also boasts a cocktail bar and visitor experience.

Production of The Dublin Liberties Distillery’s whiskey portfolio – which includes The Dubliner and The Dublin Liberties – will now commence under the supervision of master distiller Darryl McNally.

Quintessential Brands founders, Warren Scott and Enzo Visone, were inspired by McNally’s desire to push the boundaries of the Irish whiskey category, partnering with him to build a distillery to match his vision.

They were subsequently joined by Stock Spirits, which bought a 25% equity stake in the distillery and its brands in July 2017.

“Making whiskey is my passion, my lifeblood, and to be doing it in the heart of Dublin’s historic distilling district is nothing short of a dream come true for me,” said McNally.

“I believe the future for Irish whiskey is in innovation and pushing the boundaries – and that’s what I’ll be working with the team here to deliver the best Irish whiskey you could have the luck of getting on your lips. We’re inspired by the past, but not bound by it, and can’t wait to show the world just how diverse Irish whiskey can be.”

Shane Hoyne, chief marketing officer for Quintessential Brands, added: “Irish whiskey’s rise over the last few years has been phenomenal, but with talented visionaries like Darryl emerging, I believe we’re now entering its most exciting era yet. Darryl is a constant source of ideas and combined with his unrivalled distilling skill, there’s no limits for Irish whiskey.

“It is also fantastic to be partnering with a company of Stock Spirits’ calibre. Their involvement will also provide an opportunity for the brands to expand further into new regions such as Poland and the Czech Republic.

"Conagra Brands will invest approximately $78m to modernise and expand its Birds Eye operations in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.","February 21, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Conagra.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/conagra-brands-to-expand-birds-eye-plant-with-78m-investment/,"Conagra Brands will invest approximately $78 million to modernise its Birds Eye operations in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.

The expansion of the 350,000-square-foot cold storage and vegetable packaging facility is expected to create around 140 full-time jobs over the next five years.

Conagra bought Birds Eye last year as part of the $10.9 billion deal for its parent company Pinnacle Foods. Other brands included in the purchase included Gardein, Duncan Hines and Earth Balance.

The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) is supporting the Beaver Dam expansion by authorising up to $750,000 in state income tax credits over the next five years. The actual amount of tax credits that Conagra will receive is contingent upon the number of jobs created and the amount of capital investment during that period.

WEDC CEO Mark Hogan said: “Birds Eye frozen vegetables have been a fixture in freezers in Wisconsin and around the country for generations, and I applaud the company for continuing to invest and grow in our state.

“As a company with facilities all over the country, Birds Eye was looking at other options for this expansion. Its decision to expand in Wisconsin is a testament to the state’s strong business climate and outstanding workforce.”

The capsules will initially be available in four varieties, Anastasia, White Anastasia, Imperial Label and Be Cool, all of which are flavours in Kusmi Tea’s range of conventional tea blends.

Capsules can then be used with Nestlé’s Special T machines, relaunched by the company in 2016, which operate in a similar manner to the company’s other capsule systems, such as the Nespresso range.

Consumers first need to insert a tea capsule, and the machine will identify the variety of tea and then adjusts the water temperature and brewing time accordingly.

Catherine Bailly, business head of Special T said: “We are pleased to launch the first tea capsules that combine Kusmi Tea’s ‘savoir faire’ with the tea expertise and patented technology of Special T.

“We are confident that great innovation will ensure our growing success.”

Premier Foods has launched a strategic review and made a number of changes to its board as the company attempts to increase value for its shareholders...,"February 28, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Premier-Foods.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/premier-foods-launches-strategic-review-and-board-shakeup/,"Premier Foods has launched a strategic review and made a number of changes to its board as the company attempts to increase value for its shareholders.

The company – which owns brands such as Mr Kipling, Batchelors and Homepride – has been under pressure from its activist investors to sell units and streamline its operations to generate revenue.

Two of these activist investors, Daniel Wosner of Oasis Management Company and Orkun Kilic of Paulson & Co, will now join the board as non-executive directors with immediate effect. Oasis is the second largest shareholder in Premier Foods, while Paulson is the third, both of which hold stakes of around 12% in the company.

Simon Bentley, the executive chairman of UK-based ATM operator Cash on the Move, will also join the board as a non-executive director. To facilitate these appointments, non-executive directors Ian Krieger and Jennifer Laing will be retiring from their positions on the board.

According to a report from the Financial Times, Oasis attempted to oust Premier’s former chief executive officer Gavin Darby last July, claiming that “he had presided over five years’ worth of destruction of shareholder value”. This attempt failed, though Darby subsequently announced that he would step down from his position in January a few months later.

Upon Darby’s announcement, the company declared that it would aim to sell its Ambrosia brand to reduce its debts and focus on its other brands, but cancelled the plan earlier this month, blaming the current business climate.

"Keurig Dr Pepper recorded a 76% increase in 2018 net sales to $7.44bn, achieving results ‘in line with targets’, according to CEO Bob Gamgort.","March 01, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Dr_Pepper_Israeli_6Packgradblur610.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/keurig-dr-pepper-full-year-results-in-line-with-targets-says-ceo/,"Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) recorded a 76% increase in 2018 net sales to $7.44 billion, achieving results ‘in line with targets’, according to CEO Bob Gamgort.

The rise primarily reflected the impact of the merger between Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple last year.

On an adjusted pro forma basis – which are non-GAAP financial measures and assume the merger occurred in December 2016 – the company’s net sales grew 2.3%.

Net income decreased approximately 31% to $589 billion in 2018, largely reflecting the unfavourable year-over-year impact of items affecting comparability, partially offset by the impact of the merger. Adjusted pro forma net income advanced 23% to $1.45 billion.

In the firm’s largest division, packaged beverages, sales growth was flat. However, the firm drew attention to the strong performance of brands such as Canada Dry, Dr Pepper and Big Red.

In the coffee systems unit, sales were marginally down, in part due to a decline in brewing devices. KDP said the dip is a result of an increase in brewer quality that has resulted in consumers keeping their brewers longer.

Commenting on the results, KDP CEO Bob Gamgort said: “We finished 2018 on a strong note, successfully managing through the merger integration and achieving full-year results in line with our 2018 targets. We also delivered strong in-market performance, growing market share in carbonated soft drinks, single-serve coffee and other key categories.

“Looking ahead, we are confident in our outlook for 2019 adjusted diluted EPS growth of 15% to 17%, which is in line with our long-term merger target, despite the operating environment becoming more challenging.”

After the merger closed in July last year, KDP secured a deal to acquire US-based premium water company Core Nutrition for $525 million.

The firm then announced a deal with Danone Waters of America to sell, distribute and merchandise Evian water in the US, as part of a long-term agreement designed to accelerate the brand’s growth.

And last month, KDP said it will move its Texas headquarters from Pleno to a new 350,000-square-foot site at The Star in Frisco – home of the Dallas Cowboys American football team.

For 2019, the company expects to deliver net sales growth of approximately 2%.","Keurig Dr Pepper full-year results ‘in line with targets’, says CEO"

The three-year upgrade programme will restore a number of the original buildings at the site, while others will be removed and relocated to create more space at the facility.

A new visitor centre will be created, which will feature a café and retail space and will act as the ‘brand home’ for Bunnahabhain’s range of whiskies. Bunnahabhain estimates that the centre will be open by 2020.

The main production building will also be refurbished and a new filling store will be added, while six cottages will be built alongside the distillery, which will serve as holiday accommodation.

99% of the materials processed during the demolition process have been recycled, with the majority retained for re-use at the distillery.

Derek Scott, brand director for Malts at Distell International, said: “Our investment programme, here at Bunnahabhain, is about improving the operational side of our distillery for the long term future.

“We are restoring our buildings to their former glory and providing a visitor experience where we don’t just welcome visitors, after the long winding journey to get here, we help them enjoy a piece of Bunnahabhain life.

“The plans aim to make the navigation of the site much easier for the visitor and to, in simple terms, declutter it. This will ensure the buildings are more efficient from a storage point of view and located in better suited, more accessible locations to the production buildings.

“Furthermore, we are committed to reducing the environmental impact of the works. The whisky industry is starting to be more environmentally aware and our achievement of recycling over 99% of materials shows, with a little bit of extra effort, it is remarkable what we can achieve.”",Bunnahabhain invests £10.5m to upgrade its Scottish distillery

Tilray will issue an additional CAD 49 million ($37.2 million) in shares based on Manitoba Harvest achieving certain performance milestones in 2019. As part of the deal, Manitoba will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tilray.

Headquartered in Winnipeg, Canada, and founded in 1998, Manitoba sells products in more than 16,000 stores across the US and Canada.

Its portfolio includes a range of hemp-based granola, hemp-based protein powder and shelled hemp seeds. The firm plans to launch a line of wellness bars this summer.

The acquisition will expand Tilray’s product portfolio into the natural foods category, as it incorporates Manitoba Harvest’s expertise in working with cannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD).

By leveraging Manitoba Harvest’s established distribution network, Tilray plans to accelerate its expansion into the US and Canadian markets, where legal, for CBD products.

Tilray CEO Brendan Kennedy said: “We’re proud to officially welcome Manitoba Harvest to Tilray’s growing portfolio of brands and network of experts.

“We look forward to working collaboratively to develop and distribute a diverse portfolio of branded hemp-derived CBD food and wellness products in the US and Canada.”

Coca-Cola Amatil has switched to 100% sustainably accredited sugar across its non-alcoholic beverage portfolio in Australia.,"March 01, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Sugarfinal2.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/coca-cola-amatil-converts-to-sustainable-sugar-in-australia/,"Coca-Cola Amatil has switched to 100% sustainably accredited sugar across its non-alcoholic beverage portfolio in Australia.

Under contracts running to 2021, Amatil’s sugar purchases are now a mix of Bonsucro and Smartcane Best Management Practice (BMP) certified sugar. Bonsucro and Smartcane BMP are production frameworks which aim to increase on-farm productivity while reducing environmental and social risks.

The decision means the company’s sugar is obtained from farms that have decreased herbicide and pesticide use, a chain of responsibility process from production to final use, and increased use of ethanol – rather than fossil fuels – in growing and milling.

Alison Watkins, Coca-Cola Amatil managing director, said: “We have responsibilities to the community on resource use and renewal, and we’ve also heard customer feedback in favour of greater sustainability in the products we sell.

“The switch to sustainably accredited sugar is a step forward for our overall operations, and also in meeting that customer demand.”

Last year, Coca-Cola Amatil announced plans to reduce the sugar content in its non-alcoholic portfolio of sales by 20% by 2025, as part of an industry-wide pledge announced by the Australian Beverages Council.

In its full-year results published last month, Amatil said Coca-Cola volume sales in Australia grew in the second half of 2018, driven by Coca-Cola No Sugar and the ongoing consumer trend towards low- and no-sugar choices.

Coca-Cola No Sugar volume sales led overall Coca-Cola trademark volumes into positive territory for the half. “We’ve heard the message on consumer wellbeing, and we’re delivering with low- and no-sugar options for all our major beverage brands,” said Watkins.

In a move to boost its sustainability efforts, Coca-Cola Amatil earlier this year announced it will no longer distribute plastic drinking straws or stirrers in Australia and will instead stock fully recyclable and biodegradable Forest Stewardship Council-accredited paper straws.",Coca-Cola Amatil converts to sustainable sugar in Australia

“We’re excited to announce that to that end, we’ve received investment from Carlsberg as a minority partner to fuel Jing-A’s next chapter.

“We’ll be able to take the quality of our beers to the next level – including popular seasonal and small-batch beers from our brewpub – and make them more widely available to beer lovers in Beijing and throughout China.

"Britvic, the UK distributor of Pepsi soft drinks, has added a new raspberry flavour to the Pepsi Max soft drinks range...","March 04, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pepsi-Max-Raspberry.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/pepsi-max-adds-raspberry-flavour-to-its-uk-portfolio/,"Britvic, the UK distributor of Pepsi soft drinks, has added a new raspberry flavour to the Pepsi Max soft drinks range, capitalising on the growing appetite for raspberry-flavoured and low sugar soft drinks.

Pepsi Max Raspberry will supplement the cherry and ginger flavours in the sugar-free Pepsi Max range, which have generated a combined £80.5m in sales since they were launched.

As more consumers shift away from high-sugar drinks, Pepsi claims that the Pepsi Max range is an increasingly important part of its soft drinks portfolio, worth £365m and growing 25.2% in value year-on-year.

Available from retailers nationwide from March, the Pepsi Max Raspberry range will be available in 330ml cans with a suggested retail price of 67p, a 500ml bottle (SRP £1.39), a 600ml bottle (£1.39), a 1.5-litre bottle (£2.09) and a 2-litre bottle (£2.29).

Trystan Farnworth, commercial director, convenience and impulse at Britvic, said: “The latest addition of raspberry to the Pepsi Max range is incredibly exciting for the brand. Our ginger and cherry variants have already proved incredibly popular since their launch, with Pepsi Max Cherry being the number one flavoured cola.

“Pepsi Max delivers on all three category drivers; taste, health and relevance, and the launch of the new flavour will also deliver against these, helping retailers to continue to drive growth within the category.

“Pepsi Max Raspberry is available across a variety of pack formats within the channel, from the two-litre bottle, ideal for sharing, to the smaller 500ml price-marked pack and 330ml cans.”",Pepsi Max adds raspberry flavour to its UK portfolio

Hurrell, who first joined the dairy co-operative in 2000, was appointed interim CEO last August following the exit of Theo Spierings.

He will be paid a base salary of NZD $1.9 million ($1.3 million), with additional short- and long-term incentive payments based on the achievement of targets.

Fonterra chairman John Monaghan said the company’s board has been impressed by Hurrell’s leadership and commercial skills.

“Miles has been performing well under difficult circumstances. Our performance is not something that will be fixed overnight. It will require the courage to make difficult decisions, be upfront with farmer-owners, unitholders and other stakeholders, and instil a culture of accountability and performance right across the organisation.

“Miles has demonstrated the wisdom, skills, experience and frankly, the backbone needed to lead. His permanent appointment will bring much-needed stability to the co-op and our people during a critical period of change.

“His work alongside the board as we progress our portfolio review to re-evaluate our investments, major assets and partnerships; and the more recently announced full review of the co-operative’s strategy, has him uniquely qualified for the role.”

In its last full-year results, Fonterra reported a net loss of NZD 196 million ($128.5 million). For the year ended 31 July 2018, revenue from the sale of goods was down 5.9% to NZD 19.23 billion ($12.61 billion).

Last December, the company announced it is considering the sale of its New Zealand ice cream brand Tip Top as it aims to reduce its debt levels by NZD 800 million ($550.1 million) by the end of the financial year.

Hurrell said he is looking forward to the challenge of re-setting the business so that it delivers on its commitments.

“My six months as interim CEO have reinforced my view that, despite the challenges with our current performance, the fundamentals of this business are strong. To realise our potential we need to get the basics right and that means a full review of our strategy and ultimately, a fundamental change in direction.

“I’d like to thank the co-op’s farmer-owners and unit holders for their continued encouragement and support. It’s not something that I’d ever take for granted.”",Fonterra’s Miles Hurrell moves to permanent chief executive role
The Irish Whiskey Association has congratulated Clonakilty Distillery on becoming the 23rd operational Irish whiskey distillery on the island of Ireland.,"March 05, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Cheers.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/irish-whiskey-association-hails-clonakilty-distillery-inauguration/,"The Irish Whiskey Association (IWA) has congratulated Clonakilty Distillery on becoming the 23rd operational Irish whiskey distillery on the island of Ireland.

Clonakilty Distillery has this week inaugurated its new facility in County Cork, following a €10 million investment.

As well as a triple-distilled single pot still whiskey, the distillery will also produce Minke Gin, derived from whey and infused with a hand-foraged coastal botanical called rock samphire.

The distillery has commenced whiskey distillation and has opened the doors to a visitor experience, expected to attract up to 35,000 visitors annually. The distillery also boasts a gin school and The Whale’s Tail bistro.

IWA head William Lavelle said: “We are delighted to see Clonakilty Distillery open its doors and commence production of Irish whiskey.”

“It’s a welcome addition to Irish whiskey distilling, as the 23rd operational distillery on the island of Ireland, and the second distillery to commence operations this year.

“With its visitor experiences, Clonakilty Distillery also contributes greatly to the Irish whiskey tourism offering along the Wild Atlantic Way.

“Last year we saw 923,000 tourists visit Irish whiskey distillery visitor centres across the country. We expect this number to grow again in 2019. Clonakilty Distillery will play a strong role in driving this growth, educating Irish and overseas visitors on the heritage and innovation of today’s booming Irish whiskey industry.”

According to IWA figures, 2018 marked the first year that Irish whiskey sales broke the 10 million case barrier since before prohibition in the US in the 1920s.

The Clonakilty Distillery opening comes after Quintessential Brands last month inaugurated a €10 million facility for its The Dublin Liberties Distillery unit.

Located in Dublin, the distillery is said to combine traditional distillation practices with the latest in modern technologies, and features a natural spring water source on site to be used in the distilling process. Its whiskey portfolio includes The Dubliner and The Dublin Liberties.",Irish Whiskey Association hails Clonakilty Distillery inauguration

This investment comes as Beneo seeks to address the increasing consumer demand for plant-based protein sources, especially as interest in meat alternatives continues to rise.

The plant will produce the BeneoPro W-Tex textured wheat protein, made with wheat flour, wheat protein and water, which can be used as an alternative to meat in a wide range of traditionally meat-based products, such as burgers, nuggets and bolognese sauce.

The new plant will be operated by BioWanze, a subsidiary of Beneo’s sister company CropEnergies. The Wanze biorefinery utilises all raw material used in production to produce high-quality food, feed and fuel with no waste.

Christoph Boettger, executive board member at Beneo said: “We are seeing a big shift in consumer diets as an increasing number of consumers actively try to reduce their meat intake and seek out alternatives.

“Wheat protein was the most-used plant-based protein in new meat substitute launches in 2018 and we see great potential for this market in 2019 and beyond.

“Through this significant investment and new production facility, Beneo can take its first steps in exploring the market for textured plant-based proteins to allow its customers to capitalise on this rising trend.”

André Tonneaux, director of BioWanze, added: “We look forward to working closely with Beneo as we embark on this new joint venture to produce plant-based proteins.

Irish Distillers said the release marks a “bold step into the modern premium gin market” and underlines its “commitment to experimentation and innovation”.

The gin features a fusion of 16 botanicals, led by black lemon and gorse flower – imparting notes of citrus and spice with earthy undertones.

Method and Madness gin is the result of an exploration into historic gin recipes from 1798 and months of research into how botanicals work together to create unique flavours in gin.

Led by master distiller Brian Nation and apprentice distiller Henry Donnelly, the gin has been distilled in ‘Mickey’s Belly’, Ireland’s oldest gin still, which was first commissioned in 1958 at the micro-distillery in Midleton.

Nation said: “The release of our Method and Madness gin represents the next chapter in the story of us rewriting what a modern Irish spirits company can be. Through our work with the apprentices at the micro-distillery, Midleton, we continue to innovate and experiment with different grains, distillation methods and spirit types and look forward to sharing our creations with the world in the coming years.

“As a Cork native myself, bringing the spirit of premium Irish gin back to the city has been a personal highlight – and one that I look forward to enjoying being a part of for many years to come.”

Brendan Buckley, innovation and specialty brands director at Irish Distillers, added: “At the very core of Method and Madness is a commitment to push the boundaries of what we can achieve in Midleton Distillery, and I believe that taking a confident leap into the modern premium gin category is the very definition of this mindset.

“Many new producers in Ireland are releasing gins while their whiskeys mature, but we are in no terms late to the party – in true Method and Madness style, we are entering the gin market using our passion and unrivalled distilling expertise as our guide.”

With an ABV of 43%, Method and Madness Gin will be available with a recommended retail price of €50 per 70cl bottle. It will be released globally from July.",Irish Distillers boosts gin range with new Method and Madness

These organic colours can serve as a complementary targeted addition to confectionary, dairy, and beverage products, and Diana Food can also use the colours to create specialised colours blends for customers.

Diana Food says that its agronomy experts work closely with local farmers and seed developers throughout the growing process to ensure maximum quality and colour impact, in order to provide the best sensory experience for consumers.

The line also looks to tap into consumer demand for healthy snacking options, with each pack containing fewer than 99 calories. All three variants are vegan, gluten-free, sugar-free and contain no GMOs, MSGs or artificial ingredients.

The popped lotus seeds are made from the seeds of the lotus flower, which is a member of the water lily family and known for being rich in fibre, protein, iron, zinc and phosphorus.

Sourced directly from farmers in Bihar, India, each seed is heated using biofuels (popped shell husks and maize) before it is popped, which is said to create a healthy, yet light and crunchy snack.

Charlie Bowker and Darcy Ogston, co-founders of Native Snacks, said: “With consumers being more adventurous than ever and a growing change towards plant-based diets, we truly believe that Native Snacks is correctly placed to become the next globally loved snack brand, while taking our consumers on a snacking journey around the world.”

Garden Fresh Gourmet is part of the Campbell Fresh division, which also includes Bolthouse Farms.

As outlined last August as part of a portfolio review, Campbell’s is in the process of divesting both its Campbell Fresh and Campbell International businesses, in a move to increase its focus, significantly reduce debt and strengthen its balance sheet.

The divestiture has come after activist investor Third Point called on Campbell’s to sell up, attacking the company’s “dismal operating performance”.

Instead of selling up, it has focused on its Campbell Snacks and Campbell Meals and Beverages divisions in North America. As a result, the company last year raised its overall cost savings target to $945 million.

Campbell’s said the process to sell Bolthouse Farms and Campbell International are both on track, and it expects to name buyers by the end of July 2019.

Earlier this month, the company announced the sale of its Everett, Washington, refrigerated soup plant that was also part of Campbell Fresh.

Founded in 1998 and acquired by Campbell’s in 2015 for $231 million, Garden Fresh Gourmet makes, sells and distributes hummus, dips and tortilla chips both under the Garden Fresh Gourmet brand and private label products.

The unit is located in Ferndale, Michigan, and also has operations in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

"FoodBev spoke with Nielsen’s Gemma Cooper, and William Borrell, founder of Willow, to understand the competitive nature of the low-ABV beverage sector.","February 28, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/willow.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/navigating-the-competitive-space-of-low-abv-beverages/,"The rise in CBD-infused beverages and reported decline in alcohol consumption amongst younger consumers has changed the face of the alcohol sector in recent years.

One way companies have been meeting these changes is by introducing low-ABV versions of alcoholic beverages, or by releasing products such as botanical drinks and ‘adult’ soft drinks. This is in response to a wider need for health and wellness options for consumers.

With this trend continuing to grow, FoodBev spoke with Nielsen’s commercial business partner, Gemma Cooper, and William Borrell, founder of Willow, a low-alcohol spirit, to understand the process of creating and marketing low-ABV beverages in a competitive sector.

Knowing who purchases low-ABV beverages is key in knowing how to market them. Borrell notes the range of reasons as to why different consumers are reaching for these options: “The much misunderstood Millennial and Gen Z generations want to drink less [alcohol] for health reasons and are afraid of embarrassing photos surfacing online. Older generations are coming round to the idea that a break in their normal drinking habits can be beneficial – and can lead to more productive work output.”

Cooper explains that it is this more mature age bracket that may have more of a tendency to opt for low-ABV beverages compared to their younger counterparts, due to a difference in income.

“The majority of households who consume no/low alcohol beverages tend to be more affluent, and come from smaller, more mature households (45 years and above). It is interesting to see that millennial households are the least engaged demographic when it comes to purchasing no- or low-alcohol drinks in the off-trade.”

Larger companies may pose challenges to the low-ABV sector, Borrell says, as they have the power to determine how transparent the low-ABV space becomes.

“The key challenge is that larger companies don’t ruin this young category with outrageous pseudo-scientific claims and ridiculously high price points,” Borrell contends. “That sort of behaviour could kill it off.

“Also, there needs to be transparency – as there mostly is in the world of spirits. Questions such as: ‘What goes in your drink?’ and, ‘How is it made, exactly?’ need answering – but I don’t see many big firms prepared to do that, which is unsettling for consumers.

“Finally, the education between 0%-0.5% and low-ABV products is also a challenge as there can be big differences in flavour and shelf life – especially the more alcohol that is used in a product.”

Despite this, Cooper mentions how companies can use flavour challenges as an opportunity to differentiate themselves. This can either be through reranding, reformulating alcoholic beverages, or by creating new flavour profiles to complement this new beverage space: “Companies are exploring many different ways to enter into the no- and low-alcohol market, whether that be with well-known brands, new brands or creating sub-brands, so not exactly the same brand but using the brand equity to drive familiarity with consumers.

“Some companies are reformulating to ensure the same taste profile is present for their consumers, whilst others are looking at new ways to ensure a no- or low-alcohol offering which can mean a new taste altogether.”

Challenges within the sector could also be brought about for manufacturers, Cooper notes, in terms of justifying pricing points: “As the no/low alcohol trend continues to gain traction across both the on-trade and the off-trade, alcohol manufacturers need to think about how, or even if, they want to play in this sector.

“Non- or low-alcohol products can command a higher price point, with the average price of a litre of no/low alcohol being higher than the average price for an alcoholic offering, which presents a great opportunity for manufacturer growth.

“However, the shelf space in store allocated to these products is on the main alcohol aisle, therefore, as this category surely continues to grow it is worth bearing in mind that there will be alcoholic products which will lose space in order to accommodate for the influx of new no/low alcohol products.

“So, even if manufacturers are not intending to innovate into this sector, they still need to be aware of the growth in this sector and ensure their alcoholic products have a strong story as to why they should remain on the shelf.”

Borrell presents a good example of this in practice with Willow, which is a low-alcohol spirit. He says that he opted for creating this product from scratch as opposed to removing the alcohol from already existing products: “I started by diluting existing spirits to test the effect and then thought that the real joy – which is why I do this job – would come from creating a product from scratch.”

This has also created new flavour opportunities for Borrell to explore: “There are little-to-no rules surrounding this category. It’s why I settled on a base of Calvados and infused it with a unique and complementary combination of pineapple, cherry tomatoes and kaffir lime.”

Labelling and wording is also a new issue brought about by low-ABV spirits. Borrell’s opinion is that spirits without alcohol are not truly spirits. He explains: “There are now lots of these products aimed at adults. But there’s just too much obfuscation out there concerning production and ingredients. I also just don’t believe in the notion of de-alcoholised ‘spirits’ – because that’s what they’re definitely not.”

Instead, non-alcoholic beverages should be marketed as alternatives to alcohol, Borrell says: “My own passion has been to produce low-ABV spirits that can be enjoyed neat as an alternative to a spirit on the rocks – or, with tonic where the low-ABV % dilutes to create a genuine alternative to a G&T or Aperol Spritz.

“I believe that a small amount of alcohol really helps carry flavour – and taste delivery is crucial in this market. People should be able to enjoy low-ABV drinks, not ‘tolerate’ them or feel that they’re cheating themselves – which can be the case with those over-priced 0% ABV drinks.”

Cooper’s standpoint, however, is that alcohol-free beverages such as beer can be named in the same way as their alcoholic counterparts. It depends solely on their percentages: “Even low-alcohol wine can still be called wine and alcohol-free beer can still be called beer. Within the off-trade, the definition of what a low alcohol beverage is differs between categories, for instance no/low alcohol wine is 0-5% ABV, whereas within beer this is 0-1.2% ABV.”

Fears over low- and non- alcoholic beverages completely taking over the alcoholic beverage sector can be quelled, though, as Cooper explains how low-ABV beverages will become part of a wider range of options for consumers: “Alcohol will not disappear. It will continue to command space on the supermarket shelf as consumers increasingly demand greater choice.

“The growth of no- or low-alcohol allows for more choice for shoppers and consumers who may, for many different reasons, be looking to reduce alcohol consumption.

“Our Homescan Panel data shows that over a quarter of shoppers say that they are looking to reduce their alcohol consumption. And while most are doing this by simply drinking less, some are turning to low- or no-alcohol products.

"Campbell Soup recorded a 24.5% increase in second-quarter net sales, as the company benefitted from the acquisitions of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods.","February 28, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Mark-Clouse-240x300.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/campbell-soup-sales-boosted-by-acquisition-of-snyders-lance/,"Campbell Soup recorded a 24.5% increase in second-quarter net sales, as the company benefitted from the acquisitions of Snyder’s-Lance and Pacific Foods.

For the three months to 27 January 2019, the company posted net sales of $2.71 billion, while organic sales were flat.

However, the firm recorded a net loss of $59 million, largely attributable to $346 million of impairment charges on its Campbell Fresh business, which the company plans to sell.

Indeed, yesterday Campbell’s entered into an agreement to offload Garden Fresh Gourmet – a salsa and hummus brand that forms is part of the fresh division.

Mark Clouse, who was appointed Campbell’s CEO in December, said: “I am pleased that, for the second consecutive quarter, we delivered sales and earnings performance in line with our expectations, enabling us to reaffirm our full-year guidance for fiscal 2019.

“During the quarter, we continued to make progress against key strategic initiatives. Our efforts to stabilise our core business, integrate Snyder’s-Lance, deliver our cost savings agenda and focus and optimise the portfolio are all on track.

“Over time, these actions will enable us to increase investments in our core businesses while significantly reducing debt and creating meaningful value for shareholders. While we have made steady progress, there is much more work to be done to fully unlock the potential of our business.

“Since joining the team and immersing myself in Campbell’s business, I am confident in the plans in place to address our near-in challenges and opportunities, with the commitment to set a clear strategic roadmap for the future.”

Campbell’s Global Biscuits and Snacks unit has now grown to become its largest division after recording a 76% increase in sales in the quarter to $1.24 billion, in part thanks to the $4.87 billion purchase of Snyder’s-Lance. Excluding the benefit of the acquisition and the negative impact of currency translation, organic sales in the unit increased 3%.

In the Meals and Beverages business, sales in the quarter increased 1% to $1.23 billion. However, organic sales decreased 1%, as the positive performance of its V8 drinks line was offset by declines in Plum and Prego.

After coming under increasing pressure from activist investor Third Point last year, Campbell’s started a portfolio review, in a move to increase its focus, significantly reduce debt and strengthen its balance sheet.

As well as selling Campbell Fresh, the New Jersey-headquartered company is also looking to offload Campbell International, and expects to name a buyer by the end of July this year.",Campbell Soup sales boosted by acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance

According to Beam Suntory, the ABV Brands team has accelerated the growth of Beam Suntory’s portfolio in South Africa since the acquisition, delivering triple-digit sales growth in 2018 and establishing the Courvoisier brand as the country’s second-highest selling brand in the cognac category.

In total, Good Culture has secured $8 million as part of a fresh funding round, led by Cavu Venture Partners, alongside investments from Almanac Insights and 301 Inc.

This funding will expand the dairy company’s distribution capabilities and product development efforts.

Good Culture was co-founded in 2015 by Jesse Merrill and Anders Eisner, who saw a gap in the market for high-quality cottage cheese. The brand’s cottage cheese flavours include pineapple, strawberry chia, and peach.

The announcement follows on from funding by both General Mills and Cavu in the brand in 2016.

301 Inc managing director John Haugen said: “Good Culture is a trailblazing company with an incredible passion for disrupting an entire category. We are excited to partner with Good Culture to give consumers high-quality, delicious dairy products.”

Clayton Christopher, Cavu Venture Partners co-founder, said: “We are always seeking to find and support brands with a mission to change our environment and the way consumers eat for the better.

“We believed in them in 2016 and are excited to invest again with the brand as a part of their continued growth and progress, as Good Culture is at the helm of this dormant category’s reinvention.”

Good Culture CEO and co-founder Jesse Merrill added: “When we entered the market with our disruptive cottage cheese range, it was our aim to responsibly make real food, simple ingredient, superfood products that tasted amazing and worked toward a larger goal of creating a material change to the food system.”

The announcement comes as the company reports its 2018 results, recording a 3.2% decline in revenue to $54.62 billion, in part due to a struggling performance in Argentina, Brazil and South Africa. On an organic basis, revenue was up 4.8%. EBITDA was flat at $22.08 billion.

In North America, the company’s largest market, sales were marginally down. However, Mexico was the firm’s best performing market, growing volume in every major brand and every region.

Combined revenues of the company’s three global brands, Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, grew by 9% for the year.

AB InBev was boosted by a strong performance in China, as its super premium brands “continued to grow significantly”. In 2017, the company opened a new brewery in Fujian province, which is capable of brewing 1.5 million tonnes of beer per year.

The company drew attention to its ZX Ventures unit, which delivered “robust revenue and EBITDA growth in the year with strong commercial momentum”.

Last year, the venture capital division acquired UK spirits company Atom Group and Australian retailer BoozeBud, and announced plans to open a craft brewery in China. AB InBev said the platform allows it to engage with consumers more than ever before.

As a response to global health and wellness trends, AB InBev has upped efforts in the no- and low-alcohol sector – an area which now represents 8% of its volumes.

Last year, AB InBev CEO Carlos Brito said he believes 20% of the company’s sales volumes will come from its low- or no-alcohol portfolio by 2025.

The line is enhanced with a blend of omega-3s DHA and ALA as well as choline, which, according to Ingenuity Brands, can support childhood brain development.

In a statement, the company said: “Omega-3 DHA is an essential building block of brain cells and choline is an essential nutrient that connects and enhances our brain’s information ‘superhighways’.

Available in four flavours – strawberry banana, strawberry, mixed berry, and cherry vanilla – the Brainiac Kids range aims to meet a growing consumer demand for healthier yogurt options with added benefits.

Jonathan Wolfson, founder and CEO of Ingenuity Brands, said: “When we needed to switch our newborn to formula, my wife and I spent a lot of time investigating the options. The focus on brain nutrients made us wonder if our older kids were missing out. With the help of experts, we discovered that kids in America, including ours, are getting far too little of the critical nutrients their rapidly growing brains need.”

He added: “Our kids’ brains continue to develop after those first critical 1,000 days ― and we need good, kid-friendly foods to nurture developing brains throughout their childhood and teen years. These nutritional challenges presented an opportunity to create a food brand from the ground up, focused on brain nutrition and launched with yogurts that are not only delicious and fun for kids, but also help to feed their brains and close the nutrient gap.”

Mark Brooks, co-founder and president of Ingenuity Brands, said: “As a parent of three, I know how hard it is to get kids to eat good sources of these nutrients ― like salmon and broccoli ― which is why Brainiac Kids is so exciting to me.

“It’s a whole food that kids will love and parents can feel good about, as it helps every child get the brain nutrients they need to reach their full potential.”",Ingenuity Brands unveils Brainiac Kids yogurt with added nutrients
"Biotechnology firm Ginkgo Bioworks has launched Motif Ingredients, a new alternative protein development company, following a $90m funding round...","February 26, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Gingko-BioTechnology1368.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/gingko-launches-motif-ingredients-after-90m-funding-round/,"US-based biotechnology firm Ginkgo Bioworks has launched Motif Ingredients, a new alternative protein development company, following a $90 million Series A funding round.

Ginkgo Bioworks uses genetic engineering to create products for the food, pharmaceutical and other industries, and Motif Ingredients will leverage Gingko’s bioengineering capabilities and expertise to develop alternative proteins and other ingredients for global food companies.

Using biotechnology and fermentation rather than animal agriculture, Motif will engineer proteins derived from dairy, egg and meat without compromising the functionality, taste and nutrition of animal-based ingredients.

Major investors in the $90 million funding round included Fonterra, Louis Dreyfus Company, and Viking Global Investors.

Jonathan McIntyre, former SVP of R&D at PepsiCo, has been appointed as Motif’s CEO.

McIntyre said: “Sustainability and accessible nutrition are among the biggest challenges facing the food industry today. Consumers are demanding mindful food options, but there’s a reigning myth that healthy and plant-based foods must come at a higher price, or cannot taste or function like the animal-based foods they aim to replicate.”

“Biotechnology and fermentation is our answer, and Motif will be key to propelling the next food revolution with affordable, sustainable and accessible ingredients that meet the standards of chefs, food developers, and visionary brands.”

Judith Swales, the chief operating officer of Fonterra’s global consumer and foodservice business added: “To help feed the world and meet consumers’ evolving food preferences, traditional and complementary nutritional sources need to co-exist.

“As a global dairy nutrition company, we see plant- and fermentation-produced nutrition as complementary to animal protein, and in particular cows’ milk.

“Our partnership with Motif enables us to be part of this emerging area and help meet the nutritional needs of the world’s growing population.”

The popularity of alternative protein sources is growing as consumers are changing their consumption habits due in part to growing environmental and ethical concerns.

Last month, fellow US-based biotechnology firm Sustainable Bioproducts, which has developed a method of producing alternative protein sources through fermentation, also raised $33 million in a Series A financing round.

Earlier this year, Nestlé announced plans to introduce a plant-based, meat-free burger called the ‘Incredible Burger’, which is set to rival other meat alternatives such as the Impossible Burger and the Beyond Burger,",Gingko launches Motif Ingredients after $90m funding round
"Olam has acquired Indonesia’s largest cocoa processor, in a move to capitalise on surging cocoa powder consumption in Asia.","February 27, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Cocoabean-final.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/olam-acquires-indonesian-cocoa-processor-bt-cocoa-for-90m/,"Olam has acquired Indonesia’s largest cocoa processor, to capitalise on surging cocoa powder consumption in Asia.

The Singapore-headquartered agri-business has paid $90 million for an 85% share of YTS Holdings, which is the 100% owner of PT Bumitangerang Mesindotama (BT Cocoa). The remaining 15% is held by the founding members of BT Cocoa, Piter Jasman and his family.

The deal will add 120,000 tonnes of cocoa bean processing capacity and 30,000 tonnes of cocoa mass pressing capacity.

Olam Cocoa has been working closely with BT Cocoa for nearly three years and has made “considerable financial and operational improvements”, including helping the firm achieve a 30% reduction in energy consumption.

Olam said the acquisition supports the worldwide positive growth trend of chocolate and cocoa ingredient consumption and the expectation that the need for cocoa processing will continue to grow, supported by additional investment in cocoa producing and consuming countries.

In 2018, global chocolate consumption was above 6 million tonnes and is expected to increase in the next five years.

BT Cocoa’s prominence as an existing supplier to leading chocolate and confectionery manufacturers in the region will present new market opportunities for Olam Cocoa’s ingredients portfolio, such as cocoa powders brand Huysman, which was launched in Asia in 2018.

Olam Cocoa has been operating in Indonesia since 1996 and is the country’s largest exporter of cocoa beans.

Gerard Manley, Olam Cocoa CEO, said: “We are excited to have the opportunity to rapidly expand our footprint in Asia and to develop this business with the founder and family of BT Cocoa.

“Our longstanding relationship will enable us to deliver world-class cocoa ingredients and services to our expanded customer base and look to strengthen these relationships in the future in one of the fastest growing regions in the world.”

Piter Jasman of BT Cocoa added: “The relationship with Olam Cocoa represents a powerful opportunity for BT Cocoa to significantly expand our market with enhancements to quality, safety and ethically responsible cocoa products. The past three years of collaboration has clearly demonstrated the potential for delivering better value.

“The combination of Olam Cocoa’s expertise as the leading global supplier and processor of sustainable cocoa, with BT Cocoa’s strong local network, will provide our customers with increasing benefits.”

Last month, Olam revealed plans to sell off four business segments in the next six years to release $1.6 billion in cash for reinvestment.

As part of its 2019-2024 strategic plan, the company aims to offload its sugar, rubber, wood products and fertiliser businesses as well as other assets that no longer fit with its priorities.",Olam acquires Indonesian cocoa processor BT Cocoa for $90m

Each variant is sold with a suggested retail price of $5.49.

So Delicious Dairy Free was acquired by Danone in 2016 as part of its $12.5 billion takeover of WhiteWave Foods. It was previously bought by WhiteWave for $195 million in 2014.

The inaugural Stacy’s Rise Program will award $200,000 between five female-led businesses. The five finalists will be selected by a judging panel and each will be awarded a $20,000 funding prize, entrepreneurial advice and network building support, while one of these women will win an additional $100,000 grand prize award to “help take their business to the next level”.

Stacy’s has also partnered with NGO United Way to launch a separate microgrant programme which aims to raise $200,000 to support United Way’s ‘Women United’ programme, which supports initiatives in the field of health, education and finance which empower and support women of all ages.

To support this fundraising initiative, Stacy’s has released a third collection of limited-edition Stacy’s Pita Chips bags – designed by all female artists – which depict the six key stages of a female entrepreneur’s journey: inspiration, courage, grit, nourishment, success and community.

Ciara Dilley, vice president of marketing, Stacy’s Snacks. “Women have always embodied the same capabilities, courage and grit as their male counterparts to create and operate successful businesses.

“However, studies have shown that they continue to lack equal access, growth opportunities and financial investment – receiving only about 2% of all venture funding, despite owning 38% of the businesses in the country.

“As a female-founded brand, Stacy’s Pita Chips is determined to reduce that disparity and are proud that the Stacy’s Rise program will continue building upon a legacy focused on giving female entrepreneurs the nourishment they need to accomplish their dreams.”

The investment will help Kuli Kuli launch its new moringa ingredient business while continuing to boost output of its moringa powder, bars, and shots.

Similar in taste to matcha, moringa is said to be a versatile ingredient that adds a “complete protein” and an array of vitamins and health benefits for various applications.

Following the rise of matcha and turmeric, Kuli Kuli believes that moringa will soon be found in many products, from beverages to desserts.

Over the past five years, the brand has looked to pioneer moringa in the US, building a sustainable supply chain of small moringa farmers while selling moringa-based products in 7,000 stores.

Lisa Curtis, Kuli Kuli founder and CEO, said: “After Eighteen94 Capital led Kuli Kuli’s Series A financing in 2017, Kuli Kuli’s retail business tripled. We’re thrilled to continue to partner with Kellogg to grow our retail business while partnering with Griffith Foods to expand into the foodservice and ingredient space.

Simon Burton, managing director of Eighteen94 Capital, said: “Kuli Kuli was Eighteen94’s first investment and has served as a model for how large food companies can partner with start-ups to the benefit of both. We’re thrilled to grow and strengthen our partnership with Kuli Kuli.”

Griffith Foods plans to include moringa in its range of ingredient offerings for its foodservice customers, processors, retailers and distributors across 30 countries.

Brian Griffith, the company’s executive chairman, said: “Griffith Foods’ purpose, that ‘we blend care and creativity to nourish the world’, calls us to find innovative solutions to changing needs. We also know that Griffith Foods cannot do this alone.

“Our strategic partnership with Kuli Kuli will help both companies elevate moringa as an exciting new ingredient, and we look forward to bringing this sustainable and healthy offering to the food sector.”

MK is a family-owned distributor which covers food applications such as confectionery, bakery and dairy. Its employees and management will join Azelis.

Azelis said MK’s “well-equipped” laboratory is consistent with its own focus on innovation and product development.

Laurent Nataf, CEO and president of Azelis Asia Pacific, said: “MK and Azelis India have a solid and highly compatible supplier mix and this acquisition will help increase the value Azelis can bring to our customers and principals. It will provide us with an improved product offering and customer reach, in particular within the food industry.

“MK Ingredients won an award for best APAC distributor in 2016 and for exceptional business growth in 2018. This clearly demonstrates the great partnerships they have with principals, a value which is shared by Azelis.”

Azelis India managing director Aparna Khurana said: “Combining the Azelis food lab with MK’s modern and fully equipped food lab will complement our technical expertise, especially in the dairy and bakery sectors.”

Dipan Dalal, managing partner at MK Ingredients, added: “There is an excellent strategic fit and we are excited by the opportunity we now have for further growth in this market. We will benefit from Azelis’ speciality focus and connectivity with blue-chip principals on a global level, whilst the new setup will offer a much wider product portfolio and know-how to our customers.

Investment fund The Craftory led the $30 million round, providing more than 60% of capital, alongside support from Bezos’s family office, Bezos Expeditions, and existing investors Kaszek Ventures and IndieBio.

The funding will be used to support new product development, such as alternative milk and ice cream, and support NotCo as it branches out into new markets, including Mexico and the US later this year.

NotCo is the brainchild of biotech guru Matías Muchnick, biochemist Pablo Zamora and computer scientist Karim Pichara.

Its first product, Not Mayo, is made from garbanzo beans and is currently on sale at more than 1,000 stores in Chile.

NotCo CEO Matías Muchnick said: “It is a great endorsement to have both The Craftory and Bezos Expeditions invest in our business as we continue to innovate and create enjoyable, sustainable new alternative food products. Their expertise in both FMCG and technology will allow us to further disrupt the food industry and expand our offering to a global audience.”

Elio Leoni Sceti, co-founder and chief crafter at The Craftory, added: “NotCo is the epitome of a mission-driven challenger brand and has the energy and capabilities to topple the traditional food production giants. Their advanced thinking combines food tech, machine AI, and plant-based ingredients to create a sustainable non-animal protein source.

“We are thrilled to be working with Matías and the NotCo team as they transform the food production industry and give people the choice to consume environmentally conscious products.”",NotCo secures backing from Jeff Bezos as part of funding round
"Israeli start-up Inspecto is aiming to make food contaminant testing quicker, more affordable, more portable and more reliable with its pioneering device.","March 04, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/15776750_1772851746373315_3632347519310870706_1220.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/inspecto-meet-the-start-up-thats-simplifying-contaminant-testing/,"Testing for contaminants is one of the most critical guarantors of food safety, yet the current system may be needlessly expensive and fatally flawed.

Currently, a coffee grower in South America will ship a sample of their beans to a designated lab the other side of the world for testing. The process involves numerous skilled personnel such as chemists, the sample preparation and analysis itself costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time, and in all it takes approximately two weeks to gain the information.

“There are large Israeli companies that have their checks done in Germany, and we know of others that do them in Italy,” explains Yair Moneta, VP – business development for Inspecto.

The tech company – which was founded in 2016 but started to generate real pace at the end of 2017, when it had its first investments and partnerships – is attempting to popularise a new system of contaminant testing that will make it quicker, more affordable, more accessible and more reliable to identify unwanted substances in food.

Because the current system is convoluted and expensive, it often fails to do an adequate job, Moneta tells me. For instance, due to the complex procedures involved, the Israeli regulator can currently only perform survey testing for contaminants in fresh fruits and vegetables.

Inspecto’s solution consists of a portable device, sold at low cost, and disposable capsules that are specific to the contaminant they can detect. There are plans for capsules that can detect multiple contaminants at once by 2021, and Inspecto will also provide customers with optional data services.

The test kit uses surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, which involves a contaminant molecule attaching to an enhancement molecule to make the signal visible to the machine. This allows Inspecto to achieve a level of diagnosis in the range of parts per billion (ppb) – the sensitivity needed for food safety testing.

Inspecto’s device will be much less expensive to use, the company says. And with the industry expected to spend $18.5 billion a year on contaminant testing by 2021, it means that Inspecto’s solution could provide almost ten times as much data as existing methods, increasing frequency and reliability.

“Currently the companies aren’t conducting as many scans as they would want to conduct,” Moneta says. “Our feeling is they would allocate approximately the same amount of money to contaminant testing – but have much, much more information.”

Moneta explains that it usually takes a couple of weeks before companies they approach fully understand how Inspecto works, but, once they do the true potential of the device often dawns. As it is portable, they can take it around the world with them and test for contaminants wherever they are – on the process line, in the field, in storage, or at ports.

“We are talking about companies who conduct more than 100 scans per day for a single contaminant and right now they take from the chain, they send it to the lab, they wait a few days.

“Inspecto generates information about food contaminants within minutes, which means you can have reliable, actionable information. Anyone can use it; it really is a game-changer.”

And the device can still generate big data, meaning that a company’s quality assurance officers can have access to the information gained from the scans regardless of where it took place.

The start-up is concentrating on two verticals: it is aiming to offer a bespoke service to large packaged food companies, creating a solution that meets their specific needs. But 70-80% of its business will be focused on the world’s nine most commonly grown crops – including wheat, soybeans, rice and potatoes – and ensuring they are free from contaminants.

“We want to do good,” Moneta proclaims. “Fortunately for Inspecto, a lot of the contaminants apply to many crops, so the most relevant contaminants for rice are very relevant for soybeans, too.”

“Ultimately, we want to enable the food industry to be more efficient in production and help guarantee higher safety standards.”",Inspecto: meet the start-up that's simplifying contaminant testing

"The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has developed a new scanning tool to identify the entire DNA content of a food, in a move to help combat food fraud.","February 26, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Ingredients.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/irish-authorities-develop-dna-scanning-tool-to-fight-food-fraud/,"The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has developed a new scanning tool to identify the entire DNA content of a food.

According to the body, the tool can proactively identify all the ingredients and their biological sources in a food, which will aid regulators in protecting consumers in relation to potential food fraud and misleading labelling.

Working in collaboration with Identigen for two years, the FSAI has adapted a technology known as “next-generation sequencing” so that it could be used as a DNA scanning tool in food.

The idea is to compare the actual ingredients in a food, identified by their DNA profile, with those declared on the label. Previously, DNA testing of food required analysts to know what they wanted to look for specifically and then test for it – such target information is no longer a pre-requisite.

According to Dr Pat O’Mahony, chief specialist of food science and technology at the FSAI, this use of next-generation sequencing will be a significant new asset for regulators to identify exactly what is contained in a food and if that matches what is stated on the product’s labelling. It is now possible to scan the entire DNA content of a food without any prior knowledge or suspicion of what may or may not be present in that food.

Dr O’Mahony said: “Even with the restriction of having to target the DNA of certain plant or animal species in previous studies, the FSAI has been able to detect food allergens and GMOs, and demonstrate the mislabelling of fish products. Of course, targeted DNA analysis was also the method used by the FSAI in discovering horsemeat in beef products, which ultimately brought the global awareness of food fraud to a new level.”

Next-generation DNA sequencing is the basis of the new DNA food scanning tool and has been applied successfully by the FSAI to screen 45 plant-based foods and food supplements from Irish health food shops and supermarkets. It looked for the presence of all plant species in the selected products and identified 14 food products of interest that may contain undeclared plant species.

Of the 14 products selected for further investigation, one was confirmed to contain undeclared mustard at significant levels. Mustard is one of the 14 food allergenic ingredients that must be declared in all foods under EU and Irish food law. Another product, oregano, was found to contain DNA from two undeclared plant species, one at significant levels. A third product was found to have no DNA from the plant species declared on the label, but instead rice DNA was identified. All three products are under further investigation.

Dr O’Mahony added: “Our two-year project has proved that next-generation sequencing has the capacity to screen a variety of plant-based foods for the presence of undeclared plant species. It is important to understand that any results of the initial scan will always need to be corroborated by more established analytical techniques.

“Being able to scan the entire DNA content of a food means that it will be difficult to substitute or hide an ingredient of biological origin without it being detected. The plan is that in the future, the FSAI will apply the same technology for the screening of meat, poultry and fish products.”",Irish authorities develop DNA scanning tool to fight food fraud

Hansen has responded to increased innovation in the dairy alternative sector with the launch of nu-trish LGG DA probiotic for plant-based dairy products.

The Lactobacillus rhamnosus LGG strain has been included in more than 300 clinical studies and the new culture is specifically developed for fermented plant bases and produced under strict allergen control.

Chr. Hansen said nu-trish LGG DA is an adjunct culture that, in combination with a starter culture, “gives a fast and robust fermentation”. At the same time, it is said to ensure the correct levels of the LGG strain to make it relevant as a true probiotic.

“We are delighted to launch a solution that brings the goodness of probiotics into plant-based foods,” said Lasse Vigel Joergensen, global commercial development manager at Chr. Hansen. “That enables us to meet the increasing consumer demands for food products with added health benefits.

“However, while health is a key driver, it still has to taste good. A product can be as healthy as you could imagine, but if it doesn’t taste good, it will never take off. Building on our competencies in fermentation and our special cultures, we can ensure the mild and fresh taste of the fermented plant base that is required by lifestyle and mass market consumers – now with an added health benefit.”

Chr. Hansen senior marketing manager Kristen Katzman added: “We know from our recent consumer survey that consumers who choose fermented plant bases do so for a beneficial nutritional reason.

“Products focusing on general naturalness and health gain the most traction among consumers, and a ‘better for you’ profile is the primary motivator for purchasing plant-based foods.”

Last month, Chr. Hansen announced the commercialisation of a new vegetable variety – the Hansen sweet potato Ipomoea batatas – using traditional breeding methods to create a natural red alternative to carmine.

Available in the US, the beverage is made with 1% juice and has been created in response to the popularity of sparkling lemonade.

The Coca-Cola Freestyle beverage dispenser – which lets consumers mix and match drinks and flavours –had a hand in fueling the Sprite innovation pipeline. The fountain dispenser inspired the 2017 launch of Sprite cherry and Sprite cherry zero when data showed people were adding a shot of cherry flavour to the lemon-lime sparkling drink. Similar insights pointed to an affinity for fusing Sprite and lemonade.

“As we started to develop and taste test it, we realised we had a hit on our hands,” said Ryan Hughes, associate brand manager for Sprite. “Lymonade deliciously marries the sweet, crisp notes of Sprite with the tart-yet-smooth finish of lemonade.”

More than 20 flavours were trialed before the product development team settled with Lymonade, which is said to offer a “tart taste twist”.

A full marketing campaign will promote the new variant, including a TV spot featuring hip-hop duo Rae Sremmurd and a social media campaign capturing fans’ first sips. Sampling events are booked for college campuses and music and sporting events across the US.

“This is unlike anything we’ve ever done before with the trademark – Sprite Lymonade has a unique name, taste and look – so we want to make sure we educate consumers and build awareness about this brand,” Hughes said. “We think we’re on to something really special with this cross-category innovation, so we’re backing the Sprite Lymonade launch with a full media programme.”

Sprite Lymonade is available in the US in 20oz PET bottles. Coca-Cola Freestyle machines will also begin pouring Sprite Lymonade this month in a variety of flavours including peach, strawberry and raspberry, along with zero-calorie versions.",Coca-Cola launches new Sprite Lymonade with ‘tart taste twist’

"General Mills has committed to advance regenerative agriculture practices on 1m acres of farmland by 2030, in a move to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.","March 05, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Farming.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/general-mills-plans-investment-in-regenerative-agriculture-practices/,"General Mills has committed to advance regenerative agriculture practices on 1 million acres of farmland by 2030.

The US company will partner with organic and conventional farmers, suppliers and farm advisors in key growing regions to achieve the goal.

Regenerative agriculture is a holistic method of farming, deploying practices designed to protect and enhance natural resources and farming communities. These practices focus on pulling carbon from the air and storing it in the soil, in addition to helping the land be more resilient to extreme weather events.

It is estimated that the global food system accounts for roughly one-third of greenhouse gas emissions and 70% of water consumption.

General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening said: “We have been feeding families for more than 150 years and we need a strong planet to enable us to feed families for the next 150 years.

“We recognise that our biggest opportunity to drive positive impact for the planet we all share lies within our own supply chain, and by being a catalyst to bring people together to drive broader adoption of regenerative agriculture practices.”

General Mills will partner with key suppliers to drive adoption across key ingredients, including oats, wheat, corn, dairy feed and sugar beets.

“Our first on-farm training and education academies will focus on North American growers where we source high-quality oats for Cheerios, Annie’s, Cascadian Farm, Nature Valley and Blue Buffalo,” said Jon Nudi, president of North America retail for General Mills.

The company is granting $650,000 to non-profit organization Kiss the Ground to support farmer training and coaching through Soil Health Academies, where growers will learn how to increase farm profitability, build resiliency into the land and decrease input costs using soil health practices.

Kiss the Ground executive director Lauren Tucker said: “Investing in soil health and regenerating our soils has numerous benefits, including water infiltration, reduced pest pressure, resilience to unpredictable weather, and reducing greenhouse gasses.

The two companies have been working together in this area since early 2018, and in this time they have jointly developed tailored solutions for heat transfer, solid and lipid separation, and fluid transfer that can be integrated seamlessly into modular insect processing plant solutions.

According to a statement from Bühler, these solutions allow insect product producers to efficiently increase production as demand increases.

As part of the new formal partnership, both companies will further leverage their expertise to develop new solutions for this market, while also co-operating on further research and development, marketing and after-sales services. Products developed through the partnership will be sold by Bühler Insect Technology Solutions.

The potential health benefits of insects, the rising costs of conventional proteins and a focus on sustainability are driving the growth of the insect protein market, and a number of major food companies including Canadian meat producer Maple Foods have invested in this segment over the last year.

Andreas Aepli, CEO of Bühler Insect Technology Solutions, said: “In Alfa Laval we are proud to have found a partner who shares our approach and vision in this exciting new industry.

“Thanks to this collaboration, we can further increase the efficiency and reliability of our solutions, setting high standards for the industry right from the start.

Nespresso has committed $1.2m to improve the recycling rates of Nespresso coffee capsules through New York's curbside recycling programme...,"March 05, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nespresso-cups-586664_1280.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/nespresso-commits-1-2m-to-improve-coffee-capsule-recycling/,"The New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY), and Sims Municipal Recycling (SMR) have announced that Nespresso has committed $1.2 million to improve the recycling rates of Nespresso coffee capsules through New York’s curbside recycling programme.

Nespresso’s coffee capsules are largely made from aluminium, and Nespresso claims that the funding will allow SMR to better sort and capture lightweight aluminium, including foil and other mixed metals, making it possible for these items to be turned into new products.

SMR will use the funding to invest in technology that improves the efficiency of its non-magnetic household metals recycling process, helping to reduce the amount of aluminium that ends up in landfill sites.

The equipment is estimated to be operational in late 2019, and residents across the five boroughs in New York City will be encouraged to recycle their Nespresso capsules as part of their regular recycling routine.

Guillaume Le Cunff, president and CEO of Nespresso USA, said: “Nespresso is deeply committed to the circular use of our products, choosing aluminium packaging because it both protects the quality of our exceptional coffees and can be recycled and reused again and again.

“This collaboration will provide New York City-based consumers with another convenient way to recycle used capsules and other aluminium products at home, allowing these items to be given many new lives.

“New Yorkers are familiar with recycling aluminium cans, and we want to encourage people to also recycle a wider array of aluminium products that they use on a regular basis.”

Thomas Outerbridge, general manager of Sims Municipal Recycling, added: “Sims Municipal Recycling’s role is to take the household recyclables that DSNY collects from New Yorkers and convert them into commodities or raw materials for manufacturers.

“Nespresso has been extremely proactive in working with us to find an effective solution that is convenient for customers and that will allow us to direct the aluminium into productive reuse.”",Nespresso commits $1.2m to improve coffee capsule recycling
"Beyond Meat has added a new product to its meat alternative range called Beyond Beef, a plant-based alternative to ground beef...","March 05, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Beyond_Beef_Still.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/beyond-meat-adds-beyond-beef-to-its-meat-alternative-range/,"Beyond Meat has added a new product to its meat alternative range called Beyond Beef, a plant-based alternative to ground beef.

According to Beyond Meat, Beyond Beef replicates the taste, texture and versatility of ground beef, but with the added health and sustainability benefits of a plant-based meat alternative.

Made with a blend of mung bean, pea and rice protein, Beyond Beef has 25% less saturated fat than conventional ground beef, containing approximately 6g of saturated fat and 20g of protein per serving.

Beyond Beef can used in a range of applications as a substitute for ground beef, including tacos, meatballs, sliders, empanadas and more, and the product contains no antibiotics, hormones, soy, gluten or genetically modified organisms.

Beyond Meat says that the product will be released in retailers nationwide in the US later this year.

Ethan Brown, founder and CEO of Beyond Meat, said: “We’ve long had our eye on creating a product that enables consumers to enjoy all the benefits and versatility of ground beef while tapping into the human health, environmental, and animal welfare benefits of plant-based foods.

“As is our commitment, we’ve built this latest addition to our family of plant-based meats while being thoughtful about ingredient choices that support everyday use by the whole family, including strict avoidance of GMOs, soy, or gluten.”

Beyond Meat rose to prominence with the release of the plant-based Beyond Burger, and has since drawn investment from major meat companies such as Tyson Foods and from prominent figures such as Leonardo DiCaprio.

In November last year, the company announced its intention to go public an IPO worth $100 million, as the company aimed to capitalise on the rapid growth of its plant-based meat alternative portfolio.

Meat alternatives are becoming increasingly popular, with many consumers opting for plant-based products due to health and sustainability concerns, and a number of major food company’s are seeking to capitalise on the trend.

In January, Nestlé announced plans to introduce a plant-based, meat-free burger in the spring called the ‘Incredible Burger’, which is set to rival other meat alternatives such as the Beyond Burger and the Impossible Burger, while companies such as Aleph Farms – which released what it claimed is ‘the world’s first’ cell-grown minute steak – are opting for lab-grown meat as another method of ethnically-producing protein.",Beyond Meat adds Beyond Beef to its meat alternative range

Called the Laird Superfood Crescendo Machine, the product is a vegan, gluten-free and non-GMO automated hot beverage machine.

Laird said the venture gives it the opportunity to disrupt the traditional coffee machine category with an “all-natural” offering to appeal to health-conscious consumers.

The machine combines hot water or brewed coffee with Laird Superfood creamers to produce a superfood latte, superfood hot cacao or superfood golden milk with turmeric.

Laird aims to allow consumers to enjoy natural beverages in untapped markets, such as convenience and grocery stores, offices, hospitals and restaurants.

“We are excited to collaborate with Bunn to redefine the coffee experience for our customers by delivering a simplified method to craft power-packed superfood beverages at the touch of a button,” said Luan Pham, chief revenue and marketing officer of Laird Superfood.

“Bunn’s industry-leading reputation and unmatched support network provides us with the peace of mind that our valued customers will receive exceptional service worldwide.”

Ric Martin, Bunn vice president of sales, said: “Bunn’s partnership with Laird Superfood allows both parties to meet the increasing demand for vegan, non-GMO, gluten-free hot beverages that healthy consumers seek.

“Additionally, the Laird Superfood creamer line offers a variety of taste profiles that provide operators with the flexibility to customise their drink menus. We think the superfood latte platform is long overdue and will be well received in the marketplace.”

The machine, which is on show at Expo West this week, will be available for purchase or lease in the spring.

Laird Superfood was co-founded in 2015 by surfer Laird Hamilton. Earlier this year, the company secured $32 million in a funding round, as it looks to grow product development and expand its headquarters in Sisters, Oregon.

"Israel's A1C Foods was inspired by diabetes, but is now aiming to take low-carb food mainstream in everything from ice cream to bread.","March 05, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/delocatrio.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/the-food-brand-bringing-low-carb-products-into-the-mainstream/,"Having made sugar the focal point of public scrutiny, consumers today are faced with a daunting question: how can they embrace a healthier, less processed diet without losing enjoyment in the foods they eat?

For A1C Foods, the reason for asking that question is profoundly personal: after his daughter was diagnosed with diabetes, founder Ran Hirsch teamed up with renowned, Harvard-educated endocrinologist Dr Mariela Glandt – founder of Israel’s Glandt Center for Diabetes – whose father is also a type-1 diabetic.

“Our pain came from diabetes,” Hirsch tells me. “My daughter, Mariella’s patients and father – you name it. So we were trying to find food that would be desirable and good for diabetics. What we found out is that, actually, it’s good for everyone.

“Dieticians from Israel have started coming to us and saying it’s very good for weight loss. The first thing they tell their patients is ‘stop eating carbs, stop eating bread’, and they resent them for it. Now we can give them bread to enjoy that is both delicious and low carb, with no artificial sweeteners.”

A1C’s initial offering includes chocolate pralines and low-carb bread, and the company is developing other products – like pizza – with a view to bringing those to market, too. With all of the products in the range, the goal is to offer something that stands apart on taste: their low-carb bread actually tastes like bread, and they received positive feedback from an Israeli retailer on what they believed was just a first prototype of low-carb ice cream.

It is also exploring low-carb noodles, which would represent a huge opportunity in Asia alone, but the brand doesn’t want consumers to feel like they are compromising.

“There are some low-carb noodles, without mentioning names, that just aren’t the real thing,” Hirsch explains. “It gives you the feeling of eating rubber and the sauce doesn’t stick to it: it doesn’t give you the feeling of the real noodles or the real pasta.”

The products themselves are based on a formulation developed by Dr Glandt after much trial and error. There are no artificial sweeteners or ingredients that could fall out of favour later, and because the company can lower the glycaemic index of its products it has been able to use only familiar, natural ingredients.

There is still 2.3g of sugar in the chocolate pralines but, having experimented with healthy fats like palm oil that have attracted negative reception, the brand is seeking to reformulate further. Taking out these ingredients will make the formulation naturally sweeter, facilitating further sugar reduction, it says.

And for the bread, the formulation allows A1C to put a little white flour in the recipe, giving the product the same characteristics consumers associate with a full-carb loaf.

Hirsch says: “The bread has only 2g of net carbohydrates per slice, which is the equivalent of a small cucumber. When you eat bread usually, you don’t think of a cucumber as the comparison. It’s a good example of what we are trying to do: for me, toasted with butter, it’s one of my favourite foods now, and I hope the next developments we do will be even better.

“We are trying to give people the opportunity to live a low-carb lifestyle without being deprived of good food – enjoying food, enjoying life, without eating some sort of space food.”

For Glandt, a medical professional for the past 20 years, it is important to show consumers that their overall health is intrinsically linked to their diet – something they are showing a greater awareness of than ever before.

“In all of our chronic diseases of this century – heart disease, stroke, cancer – food is really what’s causing the problem. When we look at communities around the world that live really, really long, what they have in common is low insulin levels. And what raises our insulin is carbs.”

She criticises Ancel Keys, the physician who perpetuated the myth that ‘fat makes you fat’, and the American government for publishing a food pyramid that places grains at the bottom with little scientific reasoning.

“When you take carbs out of the diet, everything gets better: the quality of cholesterol improves, hypertension goes away, waist circumference improves – everything,” Glandt says.

The next step for the company is to take its products mainstream: having established a following of diabetic consumers, the company is rebranding its entire range as DeLoCa – which stands for ‘delicious low-carb’. With mass appeal in mind, it has brought on board Shali Shalit Shoval – a CPG veteran and former CEO at Sabra – as its new president.

“What I think is very interesting is that we all know two things: first that sugar has become a big no-no, and second real food is coming back,” Shalit Shoval tells me. “Real food is something that is very interesting. We all want to eat as clean-label as possible. Now the challenge is how to transfer the message to all of the population without calling it ‘diabetic bread’ or ‘diabetic chocolate’.

“Of course today, you think about ‘diabetic’ and you think it’s not tasty. The idea is to take pizza, bread, chocolate, spread and make them accessible to everybody so that your sugar levels are not going high, and the insulin is not coming out. It’s a complex message, but for a nutritionist it’s very easy.

“To have achieved this taste, this is what attracted me. And I think it can be big. The mission is to spread it as widely as possible.”",The food brand bringing low-carb products into the mainstream
Northern Irish meat producer Finnebrogue has invested £17m to build a new nitrite-free bacon facility and boost output of its Naked Bacon range.,"March 05, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nitrite-free-naked-bacon.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/finnebrogue-invests-17m-to-boost-nitrite-free-bacon-output/,"Northern Irish meat producer Finnebrogue has invested £17 million to build a new nitrite-free bacon facility.

Located in Downpatrick, the site is expected to create up to 125 jobs and boost output of the firm’s Naked Bacon line, which was introduced last year.

Nitrites are added to bacon to give the meat its pink colour, its texture and act as a preservative. Finnebrogue has worked with Spanish chemist Prosur to develop the nitrite-free flavouring process. The flavour is derived from a mix of Mediterranean fruit and spice extracts.

“It has been known for decades that nitrites used in curing meat can cause cancer,” said Denis Lynn, chairman of Finnebrogue Artisan. “That’s why, despite being the UK’s leading top-tier sausage maker, we refused to make a single rasher of bacon until we could figure out a way to make it better and safer.

“We always set out to make food the best it can be, without being bound by the way it has always been done. And so, after much research, we discovered a process that uses fruit and spice extracts to flavour the pork, keep it pink and retain shelf life. We are using this technology in our Naked Bacon and we’ve had a great response from both retailers and consumers.”

Business development agency Invest NI has offered Finnebrogue more than £1.3 million of support towards the capital investment. The 125 jobs will be created by 2022, with 30 already in place.

Commenting on the investment, Brian Dolaghan, executive director of business and sector development at Invest NI, said: “Northern Ireland’s reputation as a region that produces innovative, quality food has been enhanced by the innovation and development of nitrite-free bacon by Finnebrogue.

“The product has been welcomed by top food scientists as a significant advancement in food safety and has already found a market among health-conscious consumers.”

Finnebrogue, which also produces sausages under The Good Little Company brand, anticipates that sales of Naked Bacon will add £23 million to its turnover by 2022.",Finnebrogue invests £17m to boost nitrite-free bacon output

"FoodBev looks at the ways in which adventurous consumption may influence the dairy sector, according to a report published by NZMP.","March 01, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/adventurous-dairy.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/nzmp-report-indicative-of-adventurous-consumption-of-dairy/,"Recent consumption habits have impacted on consumer expectations, particularly for the dairy industry.

New formats and ways of consuming have also arisen, due to a phenomenon known as ‘glocalisation’, as a report on the top five consumer trends for 2019 by ingredients brand NZMP cites. This changing global demographic has shaped the way many products are perceived and consumed by the world’s population. New experiences and formats have been created to cater to this.

Continuing its prevalence, health and wellbeing is at the forefront of these behaviours. Emotional wellbeing is a core part of this, as consumers concentrate not only on their physical health, but their mental health too, NZMP says.

Under this comes the trend of gut health – which has catered to those concerned with physical health. However, the sector is now adapting to a rise in emotional health awareness, as NZMP contends that digestive wellness products can be used in health areas beyond the physical.

James Dekker, NZMP programme manager, Nutrition and Health, says: “In the past, the effect of probiotics on the gut microbiome has been all about digestive comfort and wellness. Indeed, dairy probiotics are sought after and are well known for supporting immunity.

“More recently, we have started to see evidence that probiotics may play other beneficial roles in areas such as cognition, anti-inflammation, and metabolic health. They are now moving more mainstream as part of sports and active lifestyle products for adults.”

These new reasons for consuming dairy has led to consumers reaching for yogurts as part of their top three ‘good foods’ for digestive health, the report contends. As well as this, the sector may well see products being linked with digital gadgets to achieve holistic wellness within consumers’ lives.

Ethics and sustainability is something that consumers will prioritise over the cost of a product – with 38% of consumers willing to pay a premium price for this, according to research organisation GlobalData. This concern about ‘healthy for the world’ means that consumers are also more aware about sustainable supply chains and the origin of dairy products, NZMP says.

Adventurous consumption is a key theme here. Global changes such as multiculturalism and a wider reception for global tastes have opened up new avenues for dairy, with consumers more ready than ever before to try these new ways to consume products from different regions.

According to Roshena De Leon, NZMP global insights manager, “New experiences as part of food and beverage consumption remain important. Consumers will place value on the authenticity of these experiences in place of generic products and will pay more attention to higher quality, unique and differentiated offerings.

“On top of this, the glocalisation of food that started years ago will be given a boost and we will see more ethnic foods being introduced, including ethnic dairy options.”",NZMP report indicative of 'adventurous' dairy consumption

Starting this month, the company will start selling Carrefour Quality Line micro-filtered full-fat milk featuring QR codes on packaging.

Consumers will be able to scan the code with smartphones and access an interface which will give them a “wealth of information” about the route that the product has taken – from where it was farmed or grown, right up to the date it was placed on the store shelves.

Shoppers will be able to see the GPS coordinates of farmers whose animals’ milk was collected, get information about the cows’ feeds depending on the season, find out exactly when the milk was collected and where it was packaged.

The technology will also enable consumers to identify the various stakeholders involved in the whole product line (names and photographs) and find out about what they do and if they use microfiltration to store milk and conduct quality checks throughout the production process, for example.

Carrefour’s Quality Line of milk is made at the Gillot dairy, using animals within a radius of 30km of the site and cows fed on GMO-free feeds, reared on modestly-sized farms in accordance with practices that ensure animal welfare.

The milk blockchain move follows similar use of the technology for Carrefour’s Auvergne chicken and farmhouse-fattened chicken, tomatoes, eggs and Carrefour Quality Line oranges.

Last year, companies including Nestlé, Unilever and Tyson Foods announced they are collaborating with IBM to apply the benefits of blockchain technology to the food supply chain.

The technology is being used to simplify supply chains with automatic tracking of information, such as temperature and quality of goods, shipment and delivery dates, and safety certifications of facilities.",Carrefour enables milk product traceability through blockchain

It follows the decision by Strömerstén to retire from his position after more than three years in the role, and after 36 years with the Tetra Laval Group.

Prior to her present position, Gimre held several managerial positions within Tetra Pak, including vice-president marketing and portfolio management, and vice-president technical sales and service. She started her career in 1983 as a design engineer at Alfa Laval Food Engineering, which was acquired by the company in 1991.

The announcement comes less than five months after Sidel completed a landmark move for packaging design company PET Engineering.

Founded in 1999 and based in Italy, the company produces a wide range of packaging and equipment for clients in the food and beverage industry – including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Efes.

In December, Strömerstén told FoodBev that PET Engineering would allow Sidel to offer an even broader service offering to its customers.

“For a long time, we have been supporting customers in ensuring that packaging, as a complete system (the bottle, plus the cap, plus the label) will offer the best brand experience to consumers,” Strömerstén said. “This aspect of our business will be enhanced through the acquisition of PET Engineering.”

As the new CEO of Sidel, Gimre will be taking over one of the world’s leading providers of processing equipment for packing beverages and food in PET, can and glass. Sidel has 5,300 employees and revenues in 2017 in the region of €1.4 billion.","Sidel's Sam Strömerstén retires, to be replaced by Monica Gimre"

Called Epic Rise & Grind, the line is available in two varieties: bacon and egg yolks, which offers 9g of protein; and chicken, egg yolks and apple, containing 13g of protein.

Taylor Collins, co-founder of Epic Provisions, said: “Everything we do at Epic is centred around positively impacting how animals are raised. Our Rise & Grind bars incorporate nutrient-dense egg yolks, enabling us to further support the egg-laying hen supply chain.”

The gluten-free and paleo-friendly bars will be available in the US as of June 2019.

This week at Expo West, Epic is also debuting a raft of new additions to its portfolio, including bison and chicken sriracha snack strips, cinnamon churro baked pork rinds, jalapeño pork cracklings, and coconut lime bar.

Collins added: “Expo West is the best place to share these new bars with the world. We’re also introducing some awesome new flavours to some of our most popular product lines.”

Founded in 2013, Epic Provisions was acquired by General Mills in 2016. Last year, a new line of protein bars made from cage-free egg whites, nuts, and dried fruit was launched.

"Cargill and Krones have teamed up to make a new edible oil line in Sidney, Ohio “the most efficient such line in North America”.","March 06, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Krones-201808JE01_0180.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/cargill-and-krones-team-up-on-most-efficient-us-oils-line/,"When manufacturers think of Cargill, or of Krones, they usually think about grains or filling lines for beer respectively. They very rarely think ‘edible oils’. But the two companies have teamed up to make their new edible oil line in Sidney, Ohio “the most efficient such line in North America”.

In 2016, Cargill sold its dressings, sauces and mayonnaise business, making room to expand its edible oil manufacturing capabilities. New equipment was needed at the Sidney plant since the existing system was not a true turnkey solution but rather a combination of machinery from different vendors. The line had only been used in production for a few years, and Cargill had quickly realised that it could not keep up with their production goals, which included selling to large retailers, restaurants, and food distributors.

They turned to Krones to provide a high-efficiency turnkey system that included a PET blow molder, filler, labeller and packer all from a single source.

Krones’ turnkey solution includes a Contiform Bloc and a Variopac Pro packer supported by a Robogrip robotic packer and palletiser. The Contiform Bloc is comprised of a preform transporter, PET bottle blow molder, and filler in a single block and requires up to 30% less space than a conventionally installed blow molder and separate filler; the versatile Variopac Pro offers the facility a wide range of packaging options, while the Robogrip enhances palletising operations.

After commissioning in July 2017, the turnkey line hit a high rate of acceptance on the first try. “Seven weeks after we made our first bottle we were at 98%,” said Alex Miller, North American engineering manager for Cargill.

According to Miller, many of Cargill’s customers want to buy in a portfolio of sizes from one vendor. Flexibility is needed so that they can offer all of the major sizes and volume options. The new Krones turnkey line enables them not only to meet these customer demands but to do so quickly, with accurate fills and consistent quality. “We calculate that with this equipment we can work 30- 50% faster than our competition,” says Miller. “This capability opens up a lot of options for expansion.”

This has led him to conclude that the new edible oil line is “the most efficient such line in North America”.

Another beneficial by-product has been a reduction in scrap waste thanks to the accuracy and efficiency of the line. According to Rich Szima, lead operator for the Krones line, production is running between 3% and 7% waste. With the new Krones line, Cargill has paved the way for efficient, cost-effective production in the future.

And Luke Schwieterman, operations superintendent for Cargill, had the last word: “I would put another Krones line in tomorrow,” he said.",Cargill and Krones team up on 'most efficient' edible oils line
UK-based dairy company Lancashire Farm Dairies has opened a new production plant in Rochdale following a £3.5m investment...,"March 06, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lancashire-Farm-Dairies.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/lancashire-farm-dairies-opens-new-3-5m-production-plant/,"UK-based dairy company Lancashire Farm Dairies has opened a new production plant in Rochdale following a £3.5 million investment.

Lancashire Farm Dairies produces a wide range of yogurts made exclusively with free-range milk. The new 70,000 square-foot facility doubles the amount of milk that Lancashire Farm Dairies can process, and the investment has increased capacity and capability in terms of milk intake, filling and storage.

The company claims that the investment follows on from a successful 2018 and is necessary for it to keep up with increasing demand for its products, as over the past three years, the company and brand has grown by 96%.

Jack Morrison, brand manager at Lancashire Farm Dairies, said: “As a brand we’re always looking to evolve.

“During a time of growth which has seen the company boost in sales with initial figures showing a rise of 20% since the free-range products hit shelves at the start of 2018, this investment is the latest sign that Lancashire Farm Dairies is going from strength-to-strength and is continuing to move forward as a key market player.

“As we’ve continued to see increased demand of our products, we needed to invest in the infrastructure that will continue to deliver that volume and ensure positive growth, and this new plant will do exactly that.”",Lancashire Farm Dairies opens new £3.5m production plant

As a direct result of the investment, some of the operations taking place at the company’s production site in Scherpenzeel – such as the production of pork ribs – will cease and be moved to the Boxtel site.

Vion says that the approximately 120 workers at the Scherpenzeel site will be relocated to the company’s Boxtel, Apeldoorn or Groenlo sites, or will leave “by means of natural labour turnover.”

According to Vion, this consolidation process will allow the company to operate a shorter supply chain and increase efficiency, while the operation of a single facility will make the company’s operations more sustainable. Vion estimates that the move will reduce the distance travelled by goods transport vehicles by one million kilometres annually.

The proposed plan is estimated to be completed by mid-2021, and has the full backing of Vion Food Group’s shareholders.

John de Jonge, COO at Vion Pork, said: “This investment in a more integrated production is an important step for Vion.

“It will improve our international competitive position and the quality of our products. Thanks to the careful approach, we limit the nuisance for neighbours to a minimum and it will contribute considerably to making the production of meat more sustainable.

“Optimising the production chain is one of the focal points in our strategy.”",Vion invests 35m euros to modernise Boxtel meat factory
Bubs Australia will form a joint venture with dairy company Beingmate to sell its portfolio of infant formula and baby food products in China.,"March 07, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Bubs-Australia-infant-formula.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/bubs-australia-and-beingmate-partner-for-china-joint-venture/,"Bubs Australia will form a joint venture with dairy company Beingmate to sell its portfolio of infant formula and baby food products in China.

Under the proposed venture, Bubs will supply its products to Beingmate’s distribution network, which covers 30,000 stores throughout China.

Bubs’ baby food range is already sold across 500 stores in the country and its infant formula is available through several cross-border e-commerce platforms.

Beingmate has 280 infant formula and baby food products in its portfolio and owns the largest number of registered infant formula brands in China, including 17 sub-brands and 51 product lines. Headquartered in Hangzhou, Beingmate was the first infant nutrition company to attain certification under China’s new registration system.

Bubs founder and CEO Kristy Carr said: “Beingmate’s extensive infrastructure, local knowledge, regulatory expertise and extensive domestic distribution footprint, coupled with Bubs’ unique premium international offering, will have the capacity to transform our business.

“Beingmate is particularly strong in driving distribution via China’s lower-tier cities, which are benefitting from China’s new multi-child family policy, and so there are higher expectations for addressable market growth than in the tier one cities where the costs to entry are high.”

Bao Xiufei, who was appointed Beingmate CEO last year, said: “We believe there is a terrific opportunity for Bubs to capture a material share of the super-premium infant formula and organic infant food sectors, both of which are experiencing rapid growth in China. In particular, Chinese parents are attracted to clean and green infant nutrition products for which Australia has an enviable reputation.”

He added: “We are particularly attracted to the control Bubs has over its goat milk supply chain, from the farm gate to the end consumer product, and the sheer size of its milk pool.”

New research from Advanced Lipids suggests that Chinese parents care much more about the quality and nutritional value of infant formula than its price.

Nearly three in five (59%) participants in a survey named nutritional value as one of the two factors most important to them when choosing formula, while 45% chose quality and 39% chose safety. Only 6% said price was an important factor.

According to Advanced Lipids, China accounts for almost half of all infant formula sales globally.",Bubs Australia and Beingmate partner for China joint venture

The products have gone on sale in the UK and Ireland this week in sharing and single packs. Each contains a mix of classic Milkybar white chocolate buttons with a cocoa filling and milk chocolate buttons with a milky filling.

The chocolate is being made at Nestlé’s factory in Fawdon, Newcastle, which also creates confectionery products such as Rowntree’s Fruit Pastilles, Jelly Tots, Matchmakers, Munchies, Caramac and Rolo. It’s the last of those, Rolo, which has helped to make Milkybar Mix Ups possible.

The individual Mix Ups chocolate buttons are created using a similar technique to the way a Rolo is made and are being produced on the Rolo production line with the same milk chocolate recipe. Along with Milkybar mini eggs, it is the first time that any Milkybar product has been made in Fawdon, away from its more usual home of York.

Alberto Pisanello, assistant brand manager for Milkybar, said: “We get a lot of requests from Milkybar fans who have been asking us to mix white chocolate with milk chocolate for a long time but it’s not something we’ve done before with original Milkybar.

“Milkybar is famously white chocolate so it needed to be something special if we were going to mix things up. We think Milkybar Mix Ups are very special, and if they are as popular out there as they have been at Nestlé HQ then we’re sure our fans will absolutely love them.”

Milkybar Mix Ups are on sale in a single 32.5g pack, a 78g pouch, a 95g sharing bag and a larger 196g ‘more to share’ bag.

Last year, Milkybar Wowsomes became the first product under the Milkybar brand to use two different types of chocolate in the same product.

Nestlé created the bar using a ‘world-first’ sugar production technique, which drastically reduces the amount of sugar in the bar.

The sugar contained in the Milkybar Wowsomes range is made using a process which produces aerated, porous particles of sugar that dissolve quickly in the mouth. Nestlé estimates that the Milkybar Wowsomes range contains 30% less sugar than similar chocolate bars thanks to this technique.",Nestlé’s new Milkybar Mix Ups blend milk and white chocolate

As a result of this appointment, Frank Guido will replace Colizza as the president and chief operating officer of the company’s Canadian dairy division, also effective from 1 April 2019.

The sparkling drinks are made using the same batch brewing and natural fermentation methods used for the brand’s ‘raw’ still kombucha drinks, but with the addition of a further proprietary pasteurization process while incorporating a naturally-fermented and live probiotic, DE111.

Sean J. Lovett, founder and president of Revive Kombucha, said: “Revive began with the simple idea to brew great tasting kombucha so people could kick their soda habits, just like I did so many years ago when my wife Rebekah handed me my first bottle.

“This is the closest we’ve come to meeting our original mission, as Revive Sparkling Kombucha is super tasty, yet doesn’t have a lot of sugar or calories and is loaded with live probiotics.

“Kombucha changed my life and putting this beverage in a transportable can and making it shelf stable means so many more people who are hooked on sugary sodas can more easily make the switch, without sacrifice of taste, to enjoy kombucha.”

Josh Mohr, vice-president of marketing for Revive Kombucha, added: “Our consumers are active so a portable, shelf stable can makes complete sense, yet we didn’t want to stop there. We wanted to push the lower limits on sugar and calories.

“Our sweet spot for Revive Sparkling Kombucha is the kombucha drinker that wants a lighter version they can drink more of, and the sparkling water drinker that wants added benefits from probiotics.”",Revive Kombucha releases sparkling kombucha line

"FoodBev meets Rilbite, the Israeli-based start-up making alternatives to minced meat using vegetables – and aiming to go toe-to-toe with real meat.","March 07, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/©-Rilbite-Screenshot-170.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/were-going-to-try-and-hit-meat-directly-says-rilbite-founder/,"The alternative meat category, even in its infancy, has so far been dominated by Beyond Meat and Impossible Burger. However, while both companies may be making great strides in terms of both taste and scale, price has become a real sticking point: take Beyond Meat, for instance, which typically costs retail customers in the US $5.99 for two meat-free burger patties. That often makes it twice the price of an equivalent beef patty, and possibly makes it one of the least valuable free-from products relative to the food it’s trying to replace.

One innovative start-up aiming to go toe-to-toe with the mainstream players, and aiming to compete on nutrition too, is Rilbite. The Israel-based start-up is making alternatives to minced meat using vegetables, and as founder Barak Melamed told us, has very humble beginnings.

“We’re completely, utterly healthy food-forward,” Melamed says. “My goal was to get the nutritional values right: I made a product for myself and my wife to eat, so I was looking for the best thing that I could do for myself. That was the main goal – to be extremely healthy – and yet to have a great bite and great taste.”

Rilbite produces an alternative product that combines just eight purely plant-derived ingredients including rice, lentils, tomatoes, soy or pea, unsweetened cranberries and onions. This means it has a clean-label nutrition deck often two or three times shorter than competitor products.

“Our entire ingredient list is made out of food,” Melamed emphasis. “What we have, in nutritional terms, is extremely healthy and extremely nutritious.” Rilbite contains just 146kcal (almost half that of the leading brands) with 22g of protein and 0.2g of fat per 100g of product.

The brand has a taste, smell and texture that all resemble ground beef, meaning it can be easily substituted in for meat without changing too much else. “A cook anywhere in the world could make the easy switch from minced meat to our minced vegetables in a second,” Melamed says.

“When you’re trying to do a meatball for example and you’re throwing it directly into the sauce, the product does not break; it behaves the same way that meat does.

“The inside of the product – you can’t see any evidence for rice or lentils or anything like that. The consistency and everything – it looks just like minced meat.”

The company is initially targeting the foodservice segment, beginning by getting its products into schools in Israel. The country mandates that schools must serve students at least one meatless meal per week, but children have so far struggled to get the right products and the right nutrition.

Chef Itai Farkas, who co-founded the brand along with Melamed and corporate veteran Shlomi Goren, explains: “We are participating in a programme called the 2030 Project, which aims to decrease the amount of child obesity by 50% by 2030. Our product was chosen to be used by the launch schools in Israel. We are the only vegan product that qualifies to be used in Israel in children’s foodservice. We believe that afterwards we will go seeking for other countries that want to feed their kids in a great way.

“Because we have lots of protein inside the Rilbite, we can give it to kindergarten kids and they can have a small amount, and still have enough protein by law – in Israel, we have to give them 15g of protein each day. So actually two small Rilbite balls with a bit of Bolognese sauce or half a patty is enough for the kids.”

The brand is focusing on this foodservice strategy for now, as Beyond Meat did. The reason, Melamed tells me, is because the entire product can go from field to fork in just 100 days – and with foodservice, the product can be ready one day and consumed the next. The brand will venture into retail at some point, and it’s then that Melamed wants Rilbite to compete on price.

“We’re going to try and hit meat directly,” he says.

How does it perform on sustainability?

With the growing proliferation of alternative proteins – from soy and rice to pea and hemp – there is a concern that sustainability will lose out. Consumers are better informed about proteins than any previous generation, so they are likely to know which will win out between whey, pea and rice. But do consumers understand how different proteins compare on sustainability? How much water do alternative proteins require, and how much land is needed to cultivate them?

Rilbite’s minced meat alternative requires just 76 litres of water, including the amount required to irrigate the eight different ingredients. By contrast, a leading competitor would require 670 litres to produce the same quantity, while a beef patty would use up 2.5 tonnes.

“In a world where we’re talking about sustainability and saving the planet, we’re actually doing it,” Melamed says. “We’re using 100% of the ingredients, we’re using no tap water, and we’re healthy, we’re sustainable.”

Melamed, who used to work in marketing, explains that the story behind the brand’s quirky name is a play on words from the fact that Rilbite contains only real ingredients.

“In marketing, the first thing that they teach you is that it’s very nice to find a good name – but get the domain name! Otherwise you’re going to see that you’ll have to spend a lot of money getting the domain name, because somebody else already has it. I thought about ‘Rilbite’ – but not with an ‘e’ and an ‘a’ because that’s old. Internet businesses are having the lettering fixed differently and honestly the first thing I tried was ‘Rilbite’.”

"US beer maker Craft Brew Alliance is forming a new business unit, pH Experiment, dedicated to creating, incubating and accelerating growth in new products.","March 08, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Craft-Brew-Alliance.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/craft-brew-alliance-launches-new-business-unit-to-anticipate-trends/,"US beer maker Craft Brew Alliance is forming a new business unit, pH Experiment, dedicated to creating, incubating and accelerating growth in new products.

The unit is the evolution of CBA’s innovation team and its pH Experiment beverage initiative, which launched in 2018 as a litmus test to explore opportunities outside of beer.

Tapping into CBA’s distribution capabilities and consumer research insights, the unit will develop, test, and evaluate a range of new products in select markets across the US.

Pre Aperitivo Spritz will be the first new product introduced from the division. Developed by CBA innovation brewmaster Thomas Bleigh, the beverage is a 6.6% ABV dry, botanical bubbly with a herbaceous bitterness. Available in 12oz six-pack cans and clear bottles, Pre is gluten-free, with 1g of sugar.

Bleigh said: “During focus groups with drinkers, Aperol Spritz was named as a favourite summer beverage, ranking #2 behind only beer, so we knew there was an opportunity to do something unique. With Pre, I created an infusion of herbs and spices that I believe really deliver on a classic aperitivo experience.”

CBA CEO Andy Thomas said: “What’s particularly exciting about the pH Experiment is that we’re mining a vast trove of recently acquired consumer insights and tapping into the strength of CBA’s infrastructure to anticipate and quickly deliver on emerging needs.

“With the pH Experiment, we now have the vehicle to unleash our innovation engine and create relevant new products and experiences for today’s drinkers, as we continue focusing on increasing topline growth and shareholder value.”

Karmen Olson, general manager of the pH Experiment, added: “Our goal is to provide long-term, sustainable growth for CBA. We’ll do that by combining the spirit and agility of an innovation start-up with the muscle of a large craft brewer, working side by side with drinkers, retailers and wholesalers to quickly get products to market, listen to feedback, iterate, and either expand or fail fast.”

While craft beer will continue to be at the heart of what CBA brings to consumers nationwide, the pH Experiment will be focused on anticipating and identifying drinkers’ needs. The unit is targeting $25 million in revenue by 2025.

Last October, CBA acquired three US beer firms: North Carolina’s Appalachian Mountain Brewery, Massachusetts’ Cisco Brewers, and Florida’s Wynwood Brewing Co. The Oregon-headquartered company plans to increase marketing spend and resources to fuel each brand’s growth and help drive continued innovation.",Craft Brew Alliance launches new business unit to anticipate trends
"Intersnack Group subsidiary KP Snacks has teamed up with TerraCycle to launch a recycling scheme for its packs of nuts, popcorn, crisps and pretzels.","March 08, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/KP-Snacks.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/kp-snacks-and-terracycle-partner-for-packaging-recycling-initiative/,"Intersnack Group subsidiary KP Snacks has teamed up with TerraCycle to launch a recycling scheme for its packs of nuts, popcorn, crisps and pretzels.

The free-to-use initiative will tap into an established network of recycling collection points across the UK. Packaging will be cleaned and made into small plastic pellets, which will then ultimately be recycled into items including outdoor furniture, waste bins or storage boxes.

To encourage collection and return of the packets for recycling, the scheme offers charity points based on the number of bags collected, which can be redeemed for a variety of charitable gifts or payment to a non-profit organisation.

UK-based KP – which bought Tyrrells last year and owns brands such as Hula Hoops, Butterkist, and Skips – aims for all its packaging to be recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025.

The business said it has been reducing its packaging usage over the last few years, most recently investing in its Ashby facility to enable a 23% reduction in the amount of packaging required on Hula Hoops multipacks. These new packs are being rolled out across the UK, and will be introduced to other brands in the future.

Mark Thorpe, KP Snacks CEO, said: “Plastic reduction is a significant challenge across both the manufacturing and retail environment that requires collaborative and innovative approaches. Giving consumers access to better recycling facilities is just one solution to a complex and challenging issue.

“The initiative forms part of our longer-term commitment which will also see us reduce the amount of packaging across our portfolio, with an ultimate goal of making all of our plastic fully recyclable by 2025 as part of our membership of the UK Plastics Pact.”

Earlier this year, TerraCycle, alongside a coalition of leading food and drink companies, unveiled a new online shopping concept that aims to challenge the reliance on single-use packaging.

Called Loop, the initiative seeks to enable shoppers to responsibly consume a variety of products in customised, brand-specific packaging that is collected, cleaned, refilled and reused. The content, if recoverable, will be either recycled or reused.

Speaking to FoodBev last month, TerraCycle CEO Tom Szaky said the project has been well-received by the public. “I think the world is ready for schemes like this, because consumers and manufacturers have come to realise that recycling is critically important to help a symptom, but it is not going to solve waste at the root cause.”",KP Snacks and TerraCycle partner for packaging recycling initiative
Glanbia Nutritionals aims to help snack makers capture a larger share of the high-protein snacking market with new XtraPro Seasonings.,"March 08, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Popcorn.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/glanbia-nutritionals-launches-xtrapro-seasonings-for-snacks/,"Glanbia Nutritionals aims to help snack makers capture a larger share of the high-protein snacking market with new XtraPro Seasonings.

Suitable for chips, popcorn, pretzels and other snacks, the products can boost protein content by 3g to 7g.

XtraPro Seasonings flavours include BBQ, ranch and cheddar, as well as more adventurous options such as garam masala and coconut curry.

A Mintel survey from 2017 revealed that 49% of consumers believe that healthy snacks should feature a good source of protein claim.

In a statement, Glanbia Nutritionals said: “Consumers are very clear: When it comes to healthy eating, they want protein. Whether it is to boost energy, manage weight and muscle, or enhance mental clarity, protein is now front and centre in consumers’ dietary desires. That’s led to an explosion of health-oriented meal products, but the demand for more health-conscious snack items continues to soar.

“With Glanbia Nutritionals’ new high-protein savoury XtraPro Seasonings, manufacturers can add protein and flavour to their products and capture a larger share of this vibrant and growing market.”

Speaking to FoodBev at Health Ingredients Europe 2018, Glanbia Nutritionals marketing manager Dagmar Ortlepp explained how the company is catering to consumers who are looking to consume protein through convenient, nutritious and good-tasting formats.

“We see that protein is a very important ingredient because the association of health with protein is known by mainstream consumers,” she said.

“What is interesting is that the protein is not now coming from bars which have been adapted from sports nutrition to the mainstream market, but people are looking to add protein to mainstream products like confectionery, muesli and cereal bars.”

Last month, Glanbia Nutritionals secured a deal to acquire US premix producer Watson, enhancing its ability to create new premix solutions that address the complex formulation requirements of today’s applications.",Glanbia Nutritionals launches XtraPro Seasonings for snacks
RPC Group has recommended an offer from packaging peer Berry Global that outbids the £3.3bn offered by private equity group Apollo in January.,"March 08, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1200px-RPC_Group_logo.svg3_.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/rpc-group-accepts-improved-offer-from-packaging-firm-berry-group/,"Packaging company RPC Group has recommended an improved offer from plastic packaging peer Berry Global that outbids the £3.3 billion offer made by private equity group Apollo Global Management at the end of January.

The bid from Berry Global, which values RPC at £7.93 per share – higher than the £7.82 per share that Apollo Global Management was offering – has been recommended to RPC’s shareholders by the company’s board. They say it “represent a superior offer for RPC shareholders”.

The recommendation for Apollo’s earlier offer has been withdrawn.

When FoodBev reported the offer from Apollo in January, some were suggesting that the sale price fell short of “what analysts had suggested was possible”. But Nicholas Hyett, an analyst for Hargreaves Lansdown, said that against a backdrop of intense public scrutiny over plastic waste, it would be “a bit much to expect” another company to outbid Apollo’s offer.

But that is just what Berry Global, through its subsidiary Berry International Holdings, has done. The Indiana-based business makes a variety of flexible, rigid and hybrid plastic packaging for food and other industries, as well as protective solutions like films and sheeting.

It also produces an extensive line in tapes and adhesives, and made an operating profit of $761 million from total sales of $7.87 billion last year.

The company had already made public the possibility that it may bid for RPC, after Apollo’s offer in January.

The deal is the largest in the packaging sector since Amcor agreed to acquire Bemis last year – a statement that would have still been true had Apollo’s deal gone ahead.

Last year, RPC saw revenue grow by 7% to reach £1.89 billion while operating profit increased by 3% to £214.3 million.

This is in spite of mounting pressure on the plastic packaging industry as consumer concerns around post-consumer plastic waste intensify. A total of 250 organisations – including food manufacturers and sustainability groups – signed a pledge in October to address rising levels of plastic waste, while food companies including Unilever, Arla and PepsiCo joined a similar pact earlier in 2018 to scrap unnecessary single-use plastics.

The sector is likely to come under further pressure with both the UK and European Union (EU) introducing new taxes – or outright bans – on single-use plastics.

Featuring whole grains on the outside and a nut butter centre, the bars are topped with crushed nuts and a chocolatey drizzle. Two variants are available: chocolate peanut butter and honey almond butter. Each pack contains six 37g bars.

Kind said the range is made with recognisable ingredients and contains no artificial flavours, colours or preservatives.

“Since day one, Kind has been obsessed with upholding our brand promise – to create innovative, premium foods that are both healthy and tasty,” said CEO and founder, Daniel Lubetzky. “Kind Nut Butter Filled Snack Bars continues that commitment.”

Stephanie Perruzza, health an wellness specialist at Kind, added: “Here at Kind, we are committed to empowering people to make healthy eating decisions. We saw this as an opportunity to elevate the current nut butter market with a snack that meets our high nutritional standards.”

Lubetzky founded Kind in 2004 with the aim to create snacks with ingredients that ‘people can see and pronounce’. It now sells a portfolio of more than 70 snacks. Last year, the company released its first protein bar range as well as a line of lower-sugar granola bars for children.

Called the Tetra Classic Aseptic 65ml Cube, the package is said to be an efficient solution for dairy, juice and liquid food.

The package adds to the company’s Tetra Classic Aseptic family, but compared to the Classic Aseptic 65ml packages, the new offering requires less secondary packaging and needs approximately 40% less space to transport the same quantity of products.

Tetra Pak said this means food “can now be delivered safely over longer distances, at lower cost, and made available to consumers at an affordable price”.

Hemant Krashak, product director at Tetra Pak, said: “With its robust food protection, minimal use of materials, and efficiency in distribution, the Tetra Classic Aseptic 65ml Cube package provides a simple answer to the rising need of environmentally sound packages while saving cost for manufacturers.

“Many customers with existing Tetra Classic Aseptic filling machines can easily switch to this new package with limited investment.”

The new package is now available with hand packing for secondary boxes. It has been in use since December 2018 at a customer in Southeast Asia selling coconut milk as a cooking ingredient in markets where logistics infrastructure is a challenge.

In a move to open up new opportunities in product customisation, Tetra Pak earlier this year announced a partnership with Bauer to offer full-colour digital printing on its carton packages.

It is expected the new digital printing technology will simplify the complexity of design handling, reducing the time from design to print and increasing the scope for flexibility in order placement.",Tetra Pak aims to optimise use of space with new Cube packaging

It will provide teaching and training for professionals who want to learn about new chocolate trends and recipes. More than 3,500 people have so far attended these events at the Shanghai chocolate academy.

Research from Euromonitor estimates that the chocolate confectionery category in China will expand from $2.8 billion in 2018 to around $3.9 billion by 2021.

Ben De Schryver, president of Barry Callebaut Asia Pacific, said: “As a global leader in the chocolate industry, serving food manufacturers and professional users of chocolate, we are excited about the great growth potential of China. Domestic chocolate production is increasing, and we have experienced double-digit growth in China over the last four years.

“Our confidence in the future development of the chocolate market in China, together with the desire to better serve our Chinese customers, have prompted the expansion of our footprint and distribution network across China over the next few years.”

Last year, Barry Callebaut celebrated ten years since opening its Suzhou chocolate factory, which was relocated to Shanghai in 2010. In 2017, the firm chose Shanghai for the global launch of ruby chocolate.

George Zhang, managing director Barry Callebaut China, said, “Barry Callebaut is well recognised by food manufacturers and the artisanal community in China for our innovative, high-quality products and superior customer service. Over the years, we have built our presence in China through outsourcing agreements with a number of Chinese food manufacturers, and we have established a strong network of nationwide distribution and committed channel partners.

“Today’s opening of our new Beijing office and chocolate academy centre marks a new milestone in our successful growth in this country. China’s second-tier cities, where consumption is expected to increase exponentially in the coming years, are also key growth areas for us. We will continue to extend our reach in these cities through an extended distribution strategy.”",Barry Callebaut expands in China with Beijing chocolate academy

The Denmark-headquartered company said it is now intensifying its commitment to make its meat products more sustainable. It is currently setting up a number of cross-organisational projects focusing on areas such as energy and water consumption, packaging and transport solutions. The aim is to define goals in all these areas and to establish partnerships with researchers and other companies in the industry.

Before the end of 2019, 90% of the pigs supplied to the firm’s Danish abattoirs will come from sustainability certified farmers, and the vision is for all meat to be climate-neutral by 2050.

Between 2005 and 2016, Danish Crown’s farmers in Denmark reduced the climate impact of producing 1kg of pork by 25%, of which agriculture accounted for 18%.

“We believe that we’re going to see a huge market for sustainable meat in future,” said Danish Crown CEO Jais Valeur.

“We want to capture this market and create a brand as the most sustainable producer of meat-based food products. We have a strong starting point, as our Danish owners are already leading the way on very many parameters, and this is something that we must now build on.”

He added: “Pork has unjustifiably been in the firing line for the climate impact. We’re going to change this because we now know that we could have been talking about sustainability from as early as the mid-2000s.

“We cannot turn back the clock but the results are there for all to see, and what we’re going to do is launch a concept which we, as well as our customers, can communicate and which is going to win the support of consumers. Because at the end of the day, it’s the choices being made by consumers that will drive the transition.”

The company has not finalised climate goals for beef and veal, but they will be closely aligned with the goals being set for Danish dairy production and the company’s sustainability certification for pork.

In November, Danish Crown secured a five-year deal with Alibaba’s Win-Chain worth approximately €300 million to supply an additional 250 tonnes of Danish pork a week to the Chinese market.","Danish Crown sets out climate goals, aims to form partnerships"

“As a brand, we look at everything from sustainability to company culture and how we can be a company where our clients are proud to purchase from.”

He added: “We are committed to making healthy eating easier. It’s a real problem, we all love great-tasting food. Oftentimes healthy foods don’t taste great, so we sometimes make bad choices, especially when it comes to snacking.

“We are committed to making clean and healthy paleo snacks that are craveably delicious – to make healthier eating easier. Our new Collagen Bars and Grain Free Granola Bars deliver on that promise.”",Caveman Foods debuts Collagen Bars and Grain Free Granola Bars

Plans include building a new furnace and will focus on the growing premium beer segment, which, O-I said, is highly differentiated and uses unique bottle shapes to build strong, premium brand equity. It is expected the project will be completed in early 2020.

O-I CEO Andres Lopez said: “Our customers recognise that glass brings unique brand-building capabilities. It delivers what consumers want – premium, healthy and sustainable packaging.

“The expansion at Gironcourt is an important part of O-I’s investment strategy to support the growing demand for glass in premium segments.”

The announcement comes weeks after O-I revealed plans to spend €50 to upgrade its glass packaging plant in Reims, France. The factory predominantly produces glass bottles for premium wine producers in the Champagne, Burgundy, Loire Valley regions in France.

This investment will allow the company to produce bottles in three colours and in sizes ranging from 0.2-litres to Magnum-size.

Last November, Ohio-headquartered O-I acquired nearly 50% in Empresas Comegua, a manufacturer of glass containers for the Central American and Caribbean markets.

"From probiotics and kefir to camel milk and reduced-sugar desserts, we take a look at the top day trends shaping the international dairy industry in 2019.","March 11, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/03-05-dairy-thematic-logo-600x400-300x200.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/5-key-trends-shaping-the-dairy-industry-in-2019/,"With the World Dairy Innovation Awards 2019 now open for entries, we take a look at the five top trends that are shaping the international dairy industry today.

With consumers becoming increasingly concerned with wellness, a focus on gut health and probiotics is set to be a major trend for the dairy industry this year. Dairy is said to be one of the best vehicles for carrying probiotics into the body, with some yogurt bacteria having been shown to improve lactose digestion for those with an intolerance. Kefir in particular has seen a surge in popularity in the global food and health market this year, with the global probiotics market predicted to reach over USD 73 Billion by 2024.

Growth in protein consumption has driven innovation within the dairy industry, with many consumers turning to dairy proteins as their protein of choice. According to Gail Sabatura of AMCO Proteins, whey protein, the protein found in dairy, has a 10 year CAGR of 7.5% and the market shows no signs of slowing down. Dairy companies are advertising products as “high protein” largely due to their functionality as a health ingredient, particularly as they contain all of the essential amino acids. From coffee creamers to desserts, yogurts and ice cream, we are seeing a vast increase in the number of protein-enriched dairy innovations.

Rising demands among consumers, particularly of the younger generation, for fun, new, interesting flavours are set to impact dairy product innovations. A recent report by NZMP was indicative of ‘adventurous’ consumption as global changes such as multiculturalism are opening up the possibilities for dairy. Alcohol-infused ice creams, flavoured butter and spicy marinated cheese are just a handful of the types of flavour experimentation we have seen in the dairy industry so far this year. With the plant-based dairy alternative sector now growing rapidly, competition is higher than ever and dairy companies have to think outside the box and experiment with flavours to stand out.

Delivering products with maximum taste but minimum guilt is set to be a challenge for dairy companies, to meet the demands of increasingly health-conscious consumers. So far this year we have seen a plethora of low-calorie ice creams and Cadbury’s have even released a new Dairy Milk bar containing 30% less sugar. However, some have said this still isn’t far enough as the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has argued for mandatory controls on unhealthy food. After the government introduced a sugar levy on drinks in 2018, this means we could potentially see high-sugar foods also being taxed, so we are set to see an increase in reduced sugar products for the dairy desserts market.

There are now a whole host of cow’s milk alternatives hitting the shelves and while many of these are plant-based nut milks, there is a new dairy contender – camel milk. Milk from camels is said to taste more similar to cow’s milk than plant-based alternatives and also garners many more nutritional benefits, including showing to be effective in treating diabetes. Camel milk is also lower in fat and cholesterol and rich in protein, so as trends lead towards consumers seeking healthier products with higher proteins, camel milk demand is likely to be on the rise this year.

Wider global food trends have a considerable impact on shaping trends in the dairy industry and while the trends discussed are set to be popular in the industry this year, it will be interesting to see what other trends emerge.

Britvic – which acts as PepsiCo’s UK soft drinks distributor and owns soft drink brands such as J20, Robinsons and Tango – has recruited Wilson from data science company Dunnhumby, where she also served as the company’s CFO.

Dunnhumby is part of UK retailer Tesco, and Wilson has previously held a number of financial and commercial roles at Tesco both in the UK and in the company’s international unit.

Wilson will replace Matthew Dunn, who has been appointed as the new CFO of online fashion retailer ASOS, though her start date has not been confirmed by the company.

Simon Litherland, chief executive officer of Britvic, said: “I am delighted to welcome Joanne to Britvic, she will be a strong addition to the Britvic board and executive team.

“Joanne brings considerable retail, digital and consumer experience. This, coupled with her commercial and financial expertise, will be invaluable as we continue to successfully execute our strategy and ambitious performance and growth plans.”

AB InBev-owned Carlton & United Breweries has started selling its Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught beers without plastic ring packaging.,"March 12, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Carlton-United-Breweries-2.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/carlton-united-breweries-to-scrap-plastic-rings-on-beer-cans/,"AB InBev-owned Carlton & United Breweries (CUB) has started selling its Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught beers in Australia without plastic ring packaging.

CUB’s Abbotsford brewery in Melbourne is now using cardboard to connect cans – a move that will reduce the number of plastic ring packaging being manufactured by up to 25 million a year.

The Abbotsford announcement follows the discontinuation of plastic six-pack rings at CUB’s Cascade Brewery in Tasmania last year.

As part of the company’s environmental commitments, CUB will also stop using plain shrink wrap on slabs of cans, to be replaced with new cardboard packaging.

While consumers will start seeing the new packaging in the coming weeks, it may take a couple of months for old stock to disappear entirely across Australia.

CUB CEO Peter Filipovic said: “Beer lovers can now enjoy their favourite beers from the can without worrying about their damaging effect on the environment.

“We’ve been around for 180-odd years. We’re determined to be around for another 180 and more, and our sustainability programme is critical to that. We’ve sourced and tested the new packaging, installed the new equipment, and now the new packaging is running off the canning line at Abbotsford.

“Last year, we made a commitment that 100% of our products will be in packaging that is returnable or made from majority-recycled content by 2025. The decision to stop using plastic six-pack rings is a major step towards achieving that.”

The move away from plastic rings follows similar commitments by other beer makers. Last year, Corona introduced plastic-free six-pack rings which are made from plant-based biodegradable fibre.

Corona said that if left in the environment, its six-pack rings break down into organic material that is not harmful to wildlife. It added that the industry standard plastic six-pack rings are made from a photodegradable form of polyethylene “that results in increasingly smaller pieces of plastic if not recycled”.

Meanwhile, Carlsberg released the Snap Pack, a technology which glues cans together and reduces the amount of plastic used in traditional multi-packs by up to 76%. Carlsberg won the best CSR/sustainability initiative at the World Beverage Innovation Awards 2018 for its use of the packaging.",Carlton & United Breweries to scrap plastic rings on beer cans

Called Smoobucha, the range has gone on sale in the US this week, with three variants available: citrus and guava, berry and ginger, and apple and greens.

Sold in 15.2oz bottles, the functional line includes 500 million colony-forming units of ‘good’ bacteria and is said to be an excellent source of fibre. Each flavour contains 40% less sugar and fewer calories than top smoothie items.

Odwalla brand director Sara Smith said: “Our innovation strategy focuses on bringing trends from the fringe to the mainstream health and wellness shopper. Kombucha is growing 40% year over year, but can be polarising because of its vinegary, tart taste.

“We saw this as the perfect opportunity for Odwalla to create a bridge for people who have been either intimidated to try kombucha or turned off by its taste.”

Arla Foods aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% per kg of milk over the next decade and work towards carbon net zero emissions by 2050.,"March 11, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Arla2.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/arla-foods-looks-to-cut-carbon-emissions-by-30-in-next-decade/,"Arla Foods and its 10,300 farmer-owners have launched their most ambitious targets so far to accelerate the transition to sustainable dairy production.

The Denmark-headquartered cooperative aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% per kg of milk over the next decade and work towards carbon net zero emissions by 2050.

The new strategy covers the whole value chain from cow to consumer and addresses the areas of climate, air, water and nature.

While the target is set for all markets where Arla operates, some countries might reach the target sooner based on local conditions, the company said.

Arla Foods chairman and dairy farmer Jan Toft Nørgaard. “We have worked towards sustainable farming for years and we need to go further and faster, not least to help fight climate change, which affects everyone on the planet, especially us farmers.”

Arla Foods CEO Peder Tuborgh said: “With our farmers’ further commitment, we are in a strong position to ensure that people maintain confidence in dairy as part of a healthy and sustainable diet for the future. Dairy is enjoyed across the world and plays an important role in providing nourishment to a growing world population – from a basic glass of fresh school milk to advanced whey proteins used in optimised medical nutrition.”

He added: “We believe that a growing number of consumers are willing to reward the most sustainable dairy farmers by paying a little more for their milk in the same way as we have seen with organic dairy. From today we are starting to work with a group of progressive farmers in both Denmark and Sweden to be able to offer more sustainable conventional and organic fresh milks leading the way on climate, animal welfare and farm management.”

Arla said the lion’s share of the total emissions from a dairy value chain comes from the farms. For obvious reasons, it’s not possible to reduce a cow’s methane emissions completely, but it can be significantly reduced, for example through optimised feed composition, which is a research area that the firm is investing in.",Arla Foods looks to cut carbon emissions by 30% in next decade

"Coca-Cola will launch the first energy drink under the Coca-Cola brand, putting it in direct competition with rivals Monster and Red Bull.","March 28, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/monochrome-2721732_1920-150x93.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/coca-cola-energy-brand-to-launch-its-first-energy-drink/,"Coca-Cola will launch its first energy drink under the Coca-Cola brand, putting it in direct competition with the likes of Monster and Red Bull.

Coca-Cola Energy, which will debut in Spain and Hungary next month, combines naturally derived caffeine, guarana extracts and B vitamins. It contains 80mg of caffeine per 250ml – so more than three times as much as regular Coca-Cola. The company will also offer consumers a zero-calorie, zero-sugar option – both packed in 250ml cans.

The launch is so contentious that Monster, the energy drink company in which Coca-Cola holds a 16.7% stake, is in the midst of arbitration over Coke’s decision to launch an energy drink. The company claims that it violates the 2015 agreement between the two firms in which Coca-Cola first invested in the business.

Coke already developed energy drinks like Relentless and acquired others like NOS – but those, and the rest of its energy portfolio, were transferred to Monster as part of that 2015 agreement.

Javier Meza, global chief marketing officer – sparkling for The Coca-Cola Company, said: “Coca-Cola Energy includes ingredients from naturally derived sources and a delicious and refreshing taste of Coca-Cola. We kept these two qualities at the heart of how we developed the recipe and are proud to offer it under the Coca-Cola brand, inviting people to try a new and different energy drink that is designed to complement upbeat and busy lives.”

Meza said that the Energy product would launch in additional countries through 2019 and 2020, mainly in Europe, with further announcements to be made in course.

Launching into new categories like energy drinks is an important milestone in Coca-Cola’s efforts to establish itself as a ‘total beverage’ company, much as PepsiCo is more reliant on its snacks than its soft drinks. That is to say, trademark Coca-Cola volumes are falling, so the company wants to diversify its revenues as much as it can.

James Quincey, the CEO of Coca-Cola, has previously said the company is “listening carefully and working to ensure that consumers are firmly at the centre of our business”

“If we embrace where the consumer is going, our brands will thrive and our system will continue to grow,” he said.

Quincey has previously refused to rule out a foray into alcohol – and indeed the company did launch its first ever alcoholic product for the Japanese market – while his ‘total beverage’ vision is epitomised by several recent launches.

Meza explains: “The launch of Coca-Cola Energy is in line with our work to diversify our legacy brands. This includes drinks such as Coca-Cola Plus Coffee… and the relaunch of Diet Coke in four new flavours. Coca-Cola Energy has a great Coca-Cola taste that people know and love with sweet and sour, fruity notes.”

The rationale for the transformation is clear: reducing sugar and offering sugar-free alternatives is a no-brainer, given the rise in consumer scrutiny and government intervention. But volumes have been falling too, and health-conscious consumers now drink more bottled water than they do CSDs – and without a change in thinking, that had the potential to hit Coke where it hurt.",Coca-Cola Energy: first energy drink released under Coke brand

For the three months to 28 February, the Minnesota-headquartered firm recorded net earnings on a US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis of $566 million.

Revenues were down 4% year-on-year to $26.9 billion, with the company affected by the outbreak of African swine fever in China as well as “unfavourable dairy economics in the US”.

Cargill’s animal nutrition and protein unit was the largest contributor to adjusted operating earnings, boosted by strong demand for beef as well as egg products. However, higher costs at the firm’s poultry processing joint ventures in the Philippines and the UK contributed to a decline in global poultry results.

Figures were mixed across the food ingredients and applications segment. Starches and sweeteners earnings declined on historically low ethanol prices in North America and higher energy and raw material costs in Europe. Lower sales volume and higher operating costs in North America trimmed otherwise strong cocoa and chocolate performance in other regions.

Earnings in the origination and processing division reflected a “challenging environment with ongoing trade tensions and other supply chain disruptions”, Cargill said. The trade turbulence negatively affected soybean crush operations in China, as did lower demand for soybean meal for feed following the culling of hogs to control the spread of African swine fever.

Cargill CEO Dave MacLennan said: “Disruptions and uncertainty in the global business environment continued to present challenges during the quarter, but our teams captured greater efficiencies across the company.

“We remain focused on our growth objectives. To achieve them, we are innovating what matters for our customers so they can win with consumers in local markets.”

During the quarter, Cargill announced a deal to acquire Smet, a Belgium-based supplier of chocolate and chocolate decorations. Cargill said the purchase aligns with its intent to accelerate growth in speciality ingredients. It is expected the transaction will close in the first half of calendar 2019.

Last month, the company launched a South America Sustainable Soy Policy and an updated Forest Policy, furthering commitments to move towards a sustainable supply chain.",Cargill posts third-quarter profit rise thanks to cost efficiencies

Crafted in open vats, poured into individual moulds and turned by hand, the resulting cheese is a blue that is said to be “creamy, mild and indulgent”.

The product comes with two inclusions: oatcakes and a sachet of caramelised red onion chutney. Other serving suggestions include with sliced fruit or spread thickly over a toasted hot cross bun.

Butlers created the Easter egg to introduce Blacksticks Blue to a wider audience. The dairy said the cheese has been known to convert those who dislike blue cheese.

An Israeli company is epitomising the growth in high-protein formats by releasing a hot beverage for post-workout with 21g of protein.,"March 28, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Hot-protein-drink-1.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/sports-nutrition-company-develops-hot-drink-concept-rich-in-protein/,"An Israeli company is epitomising the growth in protein formats by releasing a vegan hot protein beverage for post-workout.

Matok V’Kal has launched the Fit4style Protein Cup – a vegan protein shake with 21g of protein and amino acids in a lactose- and soy-free beverage, which can be consumed hot.

While there are many protein drinks on the market, none of them satisfies as a post-exercise recharge after a workout in cold weather, the company claimed. Proteins are ordinarily dispersible in cold water and can coagulate when heated, but Matok V’Kal has developed the new formulation that makes it technically possible to create a hot drink rich in protein.

The product comes in a disposable cup that includes the protein mixture, a stirrer, and a cap. To prepare the drink, consumers just need to remove the aluminium seal, add hot water and stir.

“The challenge of developing a heated protein drink was to find a creative solution that allows active consumers to enjoy a hot, flavourful drink after hitting the gym or engaging in other strenuous activities,” said Noam Kaplan, CEO of Matok V’Kal. “Proteins aren’t readily dispersible in hot water, so we had to overcome this problem through a painstaking process of combination and application of the essential ingredients for the formula.”

It expands the growing number of ‘new’ protein applications, with manufacturers now targeting casual protein consumers with everything from protein pizza and ice cream to protein chocolate.

Fit4style Protein Cup is the second product for sports nutrition launched by Matok V’Kal in 2019. It previously launched a mint-flavoured, 6kcal energy spray designed to provide an extra energy kick for consumers during sporting activity.

Kaplan added: “The inspiration for the Fit4style Protein Cup came from the desire of consumers engaging in an active lifestyle for an elegant, delicious protein drink in an easy-to-use format. Fit4style hot protein beverage is as easy and familiar to make — and enjoy — as a cup of coffee.”",Sports nutrition company unveils high-protein hot drink concept

At the moment, we have four flavours: lemon, cinnamon, peppermint and spearmint flavours. The next phase, fruit flavours, is aimed mainly at younger children.

“We will then look at functional options such as activated charcoal, and pre- and probiotic ingredients.”

Halai also noted how consumer demand for sustainable and all-natural products has influenced Chewsy’s approach.

“Because our ingredients come from all-natural products, this is helping producers. Mexico is currently the only country where chicle is being harvested. The original gum was created from this ingredient and taken to the US.

“Since big companies have been making chewing gum with a plastic base, harvesters of chicle have seen a decrease in income. We hope to bring that back on the table for them to sustain their families and farming. We are trying to preserve and conserve the forests in which this tree resides.

“Using all-natural ingredients means we are helping the farmers who are harvesting ingredients going into our gum.”

Challenges in creating the gum, which took two years to formulate, include the emulsification of natural flavours, Halai said. However, now that the base product has been created, Chewsy is looking forward to innovating further.

“We have learned a lot about the use of certain flavours and ingredients. As we’ve come this far, it will be not that difficult to create new products. By next year, we aim to have the functional and fruity gums out in the market.”","Chewsy's sustainable, plant-based solution to chewing gum"

Delamere, which produces a range of goat, sheep and cow’s milk products, now has its goat’s butter on sale in Australian supermarket chain IGA, three regional retail chains and a series of independent retailers across the country after the business made its first shipment to Australia at the end of 2018.

Knutsford-based Delamere Dairy now expects the value of its Australian sales to reach six figures by the end of 2019.

The business secured the distribution deal at a trade show in San Francisco, which it attended with support from International Trade Advisers (ITAs) as part of the Food is GREAT campaign – a cross-departmental initiative between the UK’s Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department for International Trade (DIT) to showcase UK food and drink overseas.

Jonathan Cope, export director at Delamere Dairy, said: “This new exporting opportunity has extended our international reach, and we’re expecting Australian sales to become a significant revenue stream for the business.

“Even though Australia has its own goat’s milk industry, we carried out analysis of the product range in major retailers via shopping websites, and it became quickly apparent there was a gap in the market for us. Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the health benefits associated with our products, demonstrated in the overseas demand we are seeing.

“To make it work we had to find the right distributor, which can sometimes take us up to 18 months and cost a significant amount of time and money. Thanks to support from our ITA, we were able to quickly find and secure an Australian partner, and we’re now stocked in stores across the country.”

Delamere Dairy, which began exporting more than twenty years ago, currently sells its products in more than 25 markets worldwide. It is currently in discussions with new partners in India.

The companies have jointly formed the Africa Plastics Recycling Alliance, which aims to turn the current challenge of plastic waste in sub-Saharan Africa into an opportunity to create jobs and commercial activity.

As part of the project, the companies will share knowledge, encourage innovation and collaborate on technical and other solutions appropriate for sub-Saharan Africa, as well as participate in local pilot initiatives.

They have also pledged to engage with the investment community and policymakers to accelerate the development and financing of the necessary waste management infrastructure and systems.

The alliance was announced this week at the CEO Africa Forum, a conference dedicated to the private sector in Africa.

In a joint statement, the Africa Plastics Recycling Alliance founders said: “Plastics will remain an important packaging material if we are to give African consumers the safe and affordable products they need. However, we need to ensure that used packaging does not end up as litter.

“Unfortunately, a lack of collection and recycling capacity in many African markets coupled with growing populations is creating a growing problem of plastics waste. We see an opportunity to tackle that problem in a way that creates jobs and reduces dependency on imported materials while alternatives to plastics are developed.

“Collaboration within and across markets will be key to success, so we are proud to launch the Africa Plastics Recycling Alliance today to increase those efforts and play our part as companies in finding solutions that work for Africa.”

While plastics make up less than 5% of Diageo’s total packaging materials, the company said it has been taking “firm steps” to minimise the impact of its plastics footprint.

Diageo Africa president John O’Keefe said: “Plastics are important to the future of Africa and in Diageo Africa we have plastic packaging alongside our glass and can formats to meet consumer needs in different markets.

“We have adopted a proactive approach to establish new, and leverage existing, multi-stakeholder partnerships which support the collection, processing, reuse and recycling of plastics and stimulate the market for recycled plastics. This new alliance represents the next important stage of this to accelerate and scale-up our localised in country recycling efforts.”",Major food and drink firms aim to improve plastic recycling in Africa
"A new report from Rabobank has suggested that demand for edible seeds in Europe has peaked, requiring food producers to find new ways to drive sales.","March 28, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Chia-Seeds.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/european-demand-for-edible-seeds-has-peaked-rabobank/,"A new report from Rabobank has suggested that demand for edible seeds in Europe has peaked, requiring food producers to find new ways to innovate and drive sales in newer markets.

Edible seed consumption in the EU exceeded more than 1 million tonnes in 2017, according to Rabobank, with imports of chia seeds and quinoa increasing fivefold since 2012.

However, demand and import growth have recently slowed in Europe’s most mature markets, such as Germany, France and the Netherlands, raising the possibility that the EU has reached ‘peak seeds’.

Product innovations in snacks and meat alternatives aimed at health-conscious consumers like flexitarians increasingly contain edible seeds, which will be key to creating fresh demand in mature markets, according to Rabobank. These innovations are providing consumers with alternatives to premium cereals and seeded bread as they look for new alternatives.

Rabobank believes producers will also look to tempt EU shoppers outside of maturing markets of north-western Europe into consuming more seeds to offset slowing growth.

Stefan Vogel, head of agri commodity markets at Rabobank, said: “We’ve seen so many new seed-based products hit the markets in recent years, such as snacks and bars, seeded breads, and alternative breakfast products, but the sector will need to further innovate to achieve future growth.

“Suppliers will need to have their finger on the pulse when it comes to feeding into product development. The consumer will ultimately determine how much of their products should be made up of chia or sunflower seeds, for example.

“Suppliers must keep on top of consumer trends to ensure supply aligns with developments on the demand-side.”",European demand for edible seeds ‘has peaked’ – Rabobank
Pernod Ricard has partnered with design agency Stranger & Stranger to create a new copper still-inspired bottle design for its Absolut Elyx vodka.,"March 28, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Absolut-Elyx-2.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/pernod-ricard-introduces-copper-inspired-absolut-elyx-glass-bottle/,"Pernod Ricard has partnered with London-based design agency Stranger & Stranger to create a new copper still-inspired bottle design for its Absolut Elyx vodka.

Made with more than 40% recycled glass, the new design aims to celebrate the vintage copper credentials central to the creation of the single estate vodka through a “sleeker, lustrous and more elegant form”.

Miranda Dickson, global brand director for Absolut Elyx, said: “With Absolut Elyx we always endeavour to challenge the normal conventions associated with luxury vodka to create a profile that is uniquely playful, luxurious and eclectic.

“We’re thrilled to have partnered with Stranger & Stranger, who truly understand our brand DNA and have produced a piece of art that captures the spirit of the Absolut Elyx lifestyle.”

Stranger & Stranger design director Rowan Miller added: “Our vision was to celebrate the special role copper plays in the distillation process in a way that lends well to the brand’s global reputation for elevated panache. The faceted bottle pays homage to the vintage copper column still from 1921 and gives the bottles a luminescent glimmer.”

Pernod Ricard describes Absolut Elyx as the “handcrafted luxury expression” of Absolut Vodka. The 42.3% ABV beverage is available in more than 70 markets and is made with soft winter wheat from a single estate in Åhus, Sweden.

In its second-quarter results published last month, Pernod Ricard recorded a 3% year-on-year increase in net sales, in part thanks to a strong performance in Asia.

In January, Pernod Ricard-owned Irish Distillers unveiled a new Jameson Irish Whiskey bottle to highlight the brand’s provenance and triple-distillation production.

The bottle shape now features a tapered body and a more generous shoulder curve, while a distinctive embossed label ‘eyebrow’ and heel at the base make the bottle more tactile.",Pernod Ricard introduces copper-inspired Absolut Elyx glass bottle
"McDonald's will acquire 'decision logic' innovator Dynamic Yield, allowing it to bring greater customisation to digital display screens at its restaurants.","March 26, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/McDonalds_Popular.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/mcdonalds-to-acquire-decision-logic-pioneers-dynamic-yield/,"Fast-food chain McDonald’s will acquire ‘decision logic’ innovator Dynamic Yield for a reported $300 million, allowing it to bring greater customisation to digital display screens at its restaurants.

Dynamic Yield uses artificial intelligence to deliver greater individualisation at customer touchpoints – whether that’s online, in app or at kiosk.

McDonald’s will utilise the American-Israeli company’s technology to provide a more personalised experience, varying digital Drive Thru displays to show food based on time of day, weather, current restaurant traffic and trending menu items. The decision technology can also suggest additional items for a customer’s order based on their current selections.

The fast-food chain, which in recent years has invested heavily in home delivery and digital technology like mobile ordering and digital menu boards, said the acquisition would “fast-track” its digital transformation.

The company tested Dynamic Yield’s technology in several US restaurants in 2018 and plans to roll it out to Drive Thru locations at restaurants in the US this year, before expanding to other countries after that.

McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook said: “Technology is a critical element of our Velocity Growth Plan, enhancing the experience for our customers by providing greater convenience on their terms. With this acquisition, we’re expanding both our ability to increase the role technology and data will play in our future, and the speed with which we’ll be able to implement our vision of creating more personalised experiences for our customers.”

Liad Agmon, co-founder and CEO of Dynamic Yield, added: “We started Dynamic Yield seven years ago with the premise that customer-centric brands must make personalisation a core activity. We’re thrilled to be joining an iconic global brand such as McDonald’s and are excited to innovate in ways that have a real impact on people’s daily lives.”

After closing, Dynamic Yield will remain a standalone company and will continue to work with other brands besides McDonald’s – but it remains unclear whether McDonald’s will exert a monopoly over the technology specifically for the fast-food market.

Dynamic Yield has already worked with food brands and retailers like Hello Fresh and Ocado.",McDonald's to acquire 'decision logic' pioneers Dynamic Yield

"Coca-Cola Canada will offer four of its best-known brands in a compact and resealable 'mini bottle', investing $14.9m to upgrade a production line.","March 25, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Mini_Bottle_Photo_for_Media2.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/coca-cola-invests-14-9m-to-upgrade-canadian-bottle-line/,"Coca-Cola Canada will offer four of its best-known brands in a compact and resealable 250ml ‘mini bottle’, investing CAD 20 million ($14.9 million) to support the rollout with upgrades to an existing production line in Ontario.

The new bottle has been described as “the first of its kind in North America”, taking inspiration from emerging markets, where Coca-Cola utilises smaller pack sizes to drive penetration in a pressured category.

Because the small size can affect carbonation during the packaging process, the mini bottle uses a coating called FreshSafe, which increases shelf-life by up to four months. But the packaging is still 100% recyclable, as with other PET plastic containers.

The $14.9 million investment will support an upgrade to production line capabilities at Coca-Cola’s plant in Brampton – a suburb of Toronto – to support production of the mini bottle.

The format will roll out across Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Diet Coke and Sprite.

“Mini bottle is one of the most exciting innovations we’ve seen in packaging in a long time,” said Coca-Cola Canada president Darlene Nicosia. “We know that people want more drink options and mini bottle is just one way that we’re meeting that desire.

“And it’s not just smaller package sizes; we’re also working to bring more low- and no-calorie drinks to the market to help Canadians choose the package size and sugar content that makes sense for them.”

Coca-Cola Canada has already promised to introduce more than 20 new beverages this year – including more low- and no-calorie drinks, bold flavours and soda water beverages.

The Coca-Cola system worldwide has increased its focus on lower-calorie and lower-sugar options since the sweetener became the object of public scrutiny a couple of years ago; the introduction of a smaller Coke bottle, which allows consumers to enjoy the same products in smaller portion sizes, plays right into that strategy.

Todd Parsons, president and CEO of Coca-Cola Canada Bottling, added: “We are so proud that one of our first announcements as an independent bottling company is that we have invested back in our Brampton facility. Having a local spirit and supporting our communities is very important to us and our aim is to grow our capabilities in Canada, which will in turn grow jobs.”

The investment follows an announcement last spring that Coca-Cola is investing CAD 85 million to build a new plant in Peterborough, Ontario to support production of Fairlife ultra-filtered milk. The new facility is on track to begin operations in spring 2020.

The mini bottle will be available in two packages: a 250ml single-serve bottle, as well as a pack of eight 300ml bottles.",Coca-Cola supports new 'mini bottle' with $15m investment
Nestlé aims to accelerate trend-based innovation in China as it inaugurates a new research and development centre in Beijing,"March 26, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/30856232495_16d423e1dd_o.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/nestle-opens-new-research-and-development-centre-in-beijing/,"Nestlé aims to accelerate trend-based innovation in China as it inaugurates a new research and development centre (R&D) in Beijing and a system technology hub in Shenzhen.

Located close to the Nestlé China headquarters, the new R&D site includes prototyping and packaging labs as well as a consumer insight area, and will create new food and beverage products for consumers in China and elsewhere in Asia.

More than 40 specialists will be employed at the facility, working across multiple product categories. They will collaborate with local universities and innovation partners. The site also houses the Nestlé Food Safety Institute in China.

Nestlé CEO Mark Schneider said at the opening event: “China is one of the fastest-changing food and beverage markets in the world, and a significant growth driver for Nestlé. We are strengthening our local R&D capabilities so that our teams can work faster and more efficiently to turn great ideas into the latest must-have products for consumers in China.”

The Shenzhen system technology hub is an extension of the Nestlé system technology centre in Orbe, Switzerland.

Nestlé said the location of the new facility near leading beverage machine and system manufacturers will enable it to turn new ideas for beverage systems and components into reality. Engineers based in Shenzhen will also scout new system technologies relevant for Nestlé’s global beverage businesses.

Nestlé CTO Stefan Palzer said: “We are constantly looking for opportunities to increase the speed of our trend-based innovation. The proximity of the R&D team to the Nestlé China headquarters and of the system technology hub to our suppliers and manufacturers will enable a strong collaboration that will help Nestlé push the boundaries by bringing breakthrough innovations to the market faster.”

Last year, Nestlé launched a China incubator team, which released a range of ready-to-drink herbal drinks and soups made with traditional Chinese ingredients. The company said the development of the Xingshan range shows how it is adapting to meet rapidly changing consumer tastes.

As part of the deal, Lantmännen is acquiring an oat mill with a capacity of 55,000 tons and an oat ingredients manufacturing facility.

The purchased facility has around 35 employees and currently produces oat protein, beta glucan and oat flour. Completion of the transaction will take place on 29 March 2019.

Joan Braca, president of food and beverage solutions at Tate & Lyle, said: “We are pleased to reach this agreement with Lantmännen which represents a good outcome for our oat ingredient employees and customers and enables us to focus our business on serving our customers in our main food and beverage categories. We wish Lantmännen and its employees every success for the future.”

Lantmännen said the additional oats capacity will enable it to meet growing demand from customers in the Nordic food industry.

The company has three oatmeal mills in Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and markets food and ingredients based on oats to the food industry. It is currently pursuing research and innovation to develop new oat products.

Per Olof Nyman, CEO of Lantmännen, said: “Oats are a strategic investment area for Lantmännen and the further development of our oats business is a key part of our ‘Field to Fork 2030’ strategy.

“We are already strongly positioned in oats and this acquisition gives Lantmännen access to a modern mill that complements our existing production capacity within oats and creates a unique opportunity to develop and manufacture ingredients based on oats as the raw material.”

Once the acquisition has been completed, the facility will become part of the Lantmännen energy sector.

Magnus Kagevik, head of the energy sector at Lantmännen, said: “Lantmännen’s energy sector already has specialist expertise within the processing of wheat, and oat products will be an excellent complement to our current business.

“The acquisition enables Lantmännen to increase the production capacity of heat-treated oats significantly and gives us an opportunity to create added value within oat processing. It also creates synergies both within the energy sector and our other businesses at Lantmännen.”",Lantmännen acquires Tate & Lyle’s oat ingredient business
Manufacturers are increasingly looking to profit from new opportunities in the hemp-based food and drink space following the passage of the US farm bill.,"March 25, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Manitoba-Harvest.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/tracking-growth-in-the-hemp-based-food-and-drink-sector/,"The passage last December of the US farm bill has opened new doors for innovation in the food and beverage sector as hemp became legal on a federal level in the country.

Instead of a controlled substance, the plant is now treated as a farm commodity, meaning there are far fewer barriers for companies looking to enter the market – leading to a surge in activity in the sector.

According to cannabis and CBD industry market research firm Brightfield Group, the hemp CBD market is growing at a “breathtaking pace” and could be worth $22 billion by 2022.

With such positive projections, hemp growers are increasingly under pressure to supply the best strains of the plant to meet demand.

This is a challenge that agricultural food ingredient company Arcadia Biosciences hopes to solve through a new business unit dedicated to the optimisation of cannabis plant content, quality, climate resiliency and yield.

“Industrial hemp, along with all strains of cannabis, are decades behind other agricultural crops in terms of improved plant genetics,” said Matt Plavan, Arcadia Biosciences CFO and president of the newly formed Arcadia Specialty Genomics unit.

“As with our wheat and soybean products, we will create hemp-­based solutions that allow farmers to be more productive and enable consumer packaged goods companies to differentiate their brands in the marketplace.”

Arcadia aims to create a suite of hemp varieties with more desirable plant content, such as zero-THC, higher-CBD varieties that can be harvested to create functional hemp-based ingredients such as CBD oil.

For Plavan, the passage of the farm bill has created an “enormous opportunity” to impact the quality and reliability of the hemp-based ingredient supply. “Today, the majority of the CBD found in food, beverages and supplements is imported, unregulated and often untested,” he said.

“The 2018 farm bill will change that landscape and respond to government, CPG and consumer demand for high-quality US-grown hemp – an ingredient with many associated health and dietary benefits that are highly desirable and marketable.”

With food and beverage manufacturers scrambling to develop and launch hemp-based products, there has been an increase in cross-sector collaborations. Earlier this month, cannabis company Tilray expanded into the natural food category after completing the $318 million acquisition of Manitoba Harvest, which it describes as the world’s largest hemp food manufacturer.

Canada-based Manitoba Harvest produces a range of hemp-based granola, hemp-based protein powder and shelled hemp seeds. It also plans to release hemp wellness bars this summer.

“Diversifying the Tilray portfolio to include hemp-based food products and expanding our production footprint to include hemp supply sources allows Tilray to be well-positioned to lead in the natural hemp foods, CBD and cannabis space,” a Tilray spokesperson told FoodBev.

“Our strategic acquisition of Manitoba Harvest gives us a major advantage of brand recognition, state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities, a robust supply chain network, distribution in over 16,000 major retailers, and 20 years of leadership and credibility in the hemp foods industry.”

One of the main challenges that Tilray and Manitoba are up against is the increase in product launches as new players enter the sector. One company that is looking to take advantage of growth in the market is Elmhurst 1925, a New York-based producer of plant-based nut and grain milks.

Last week, the firm released a new unsweetened hemp creamer, which is crafted with four ingredients, including hemp cream made from hemp seeds.

It took the company four months to bring the creamer from concept stage to a commercially packaged product. It has been created through Elmhurst’s HydroRelease method – a process that separates the components of a nut, grain or seed before reassembling them as a creamy, beverage-ready emulsion.

Elmhurst had to overcome the strong flavour of hemp and its stability in low-pH coffee but the firm believes there exists a demand for such products among today’s consumers.

Shashank Gaur, senior food scientist at Elmhurst 1925, said that as well as promoting diversity within the plant-based category, hemp-based products provide “exceptional nutritional and medicinal benefits”.

“As the hemp industry matures, the consumer taste preferences will continue to evolve and their palates will become more and more refined,” he said.

The company is already planning the launch of new hemp-based creamers, including French vanilla, hazelnut, and golden milk variants.

And with products as diverse as hemp water, hemp-based coconut snacks and even hemp liqueur going on sale in recent months, further growth can be expected right across the food and drink industry.",Tracking growth in the hemp-based food and drink sector

The plant – near Cuijk, in the southeast of the country – uses hydrolysation to break down cow’s milk proteins into smaller protein fragments, resulting in infant formula that is less likely to trigger an allergic reaction in infants with an allergy to cow’s milk protein, according to Danone.

The facility will have double the production capacity of its local legacy plant – despite using 60% less water, 25% less energy and emitting 50% less CO2.

It represents one of Danone’s largest investments anywhere in its European production network during the last ten years and, once fully operational, will employ close to 500 people.

A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held at the site this afternoon, more than three years after the investment was first announced.

Veronique Penchienati-Bosetta, executive vice-president for Danone Specialized Nutrition, said: “At Danone, we believe the health of people and the planet are interconnected, as expressed through our company vision ‘One Planet. One Health’. Our new Nutricia Cuijk facility is a significant investment towards achieving that vision. At this facility, we’ll be producing food for vulnerable babies; and we’re also doing everything we can to preserve a healthy and clean environment for future generations.”

Danone pointed out that the global prevalence of allergies was steadily rising, and research published in the journal Nature has suggested that between 2% and 5% of infants develop an allergy to cow’s milk protein within the first year of their life.

The new plant doubles Danone Nutricia’s production capacity in Cuijk while cutting water and energy consumption, as well as CO2 emissions.

The newly built facility uses advanced environmental technologies coupled with efficiently designed manufacturing processes to ensure that the plant’s overall footprint is kept to a minimum. And the site will be fully powered by renewable electricity, allowing it to reduce its carbon footprint further.

Danone is also targeting a reduction in Nutricia Cuijk’s full-scope carbon emissions. The plant will source dairy ingredients exclusively from Western Europe, which has the lowest CO2 emissions from dairy farming of any region in the world.

Of these ingredients, a significant majority are sourced locally – from the Netherlands and Germany. Nutricia Cuijk will also embrace the principles of the circular economy – 100% of the facility’s waste is recovered, including all packaging waste, Danone said.

The plant replaces an existing facility in Cuijk, which will gradually be phased out.

Carola Schouten, deputy prime minister of the Netherlands and minister for agriculture, nature and food quality, said: “Danone’s Nutricia Cuijk facility is not only a monument to innovation and sustainable production, but also a recognition of the Netherlands as a dairy country. With the opening of this factory, Danone again contributes to Dutch ‘Topsector’ [the industries in which Dutch businesses perform best] knowhow, and our expertise in specialised nutrition.”",Danone Nutricia opens 240m euro infant formula plant
Danone North America has expanded its Stok Cold Brew portfolio with dairy-free Stok Oatmilk Latte and Stok Almondmilk Mocha.,"March 26, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Stok.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/danone-north-america-releases-two-dairy-free-stok-cold-brews/,"Danone North America has expanded its Stok Cold Brew portfolio with two new dairy-free creamed coffees.

Stok Oatmilk Latte and Stok Almondmilk Mocha are brewed using a ten-hour process that results in a “smooth, coffee-forward experience”.

The oat milk variant is said to add a layer of creaminess while allowing the coffee flavour to shine through. It contains 135mg of caffeine per 12oz serving.

Meanwhile, the almond milk cold brew features 130mg of caffeine and 15g of sugar per 12oz serving and is complemented by chocolate.

Lindsey Morgan, marketing director for Stok Cold Brew, said: “At Stok, we take the craft of cold brew coffee seriously – but we also like to tinker with our recipes and have some fun.

“Our new Oatmilk Latte and Almondmilk Mocha Cold Brews offer coffee fans a delicious, creamy and ready-to-drink brew that they can enjoy whenever the need for a pick-me-up strikes.”

Dairy-free, gluten-free and certified vegan, both cold brews are available in the US in 48oz multi-serve bottles with a suggested retail price of $5.49.

Last year, Danone North America launched Stok Protein Cold Brew Coffee, which contains 16g of protein per serving.

Last October, Danone revealed plans to triple the size of its plant-based business by 2025, aiming to grow plant-based sales from €1.7 billion to around €5 billion.

Its Danone North America subsidiary has since opened a new building at its DuBois, Pennsylvania, facility to increase production of its plant-based foods.

Following a multi-million-dollar investment, the site will now produce Vega yogurt alternatives and nutritional powders, as well as Silk yogurt alternatives and So Delicious Dairy Free yogurt alternatives and dairy-free cheese shreds.",Danone North America releases two dairy-free Stok cold brews

Called Britannica, the bitter liqueur has been three years in the making and was part of an international tasting programme that Asterley Bros organised. More than 1,000 samples were sent to recipients worldwide to taste and critique at each stage of recipe development.

The final blend was selected by in late 2018 and features myrrh, rosemary, cacao nibs, hazelnuts, cinchona, cinnamon and yarrow, before adding London porter.

Fernet is a bitter sub-category of Italian spirit amaro. According to Asterley Bros, the beverage is growing in popularity in the US, where there has been a range of new releases in recent years.

Asterley Bros director and founder James Berry said: “We think the UK is ready to drink more fernet. We wanted to create a style that wasn’t just for the devoted bitter enthusiast but could be a little more approachable, for the wider public to enjoy.

“It was really important to us to be able to use London’s world-renowned porter-style beer, as it perfectly complements the botanicals in the fernet base and brings a rich, roasted malty complexity to the liqueur.

“By bringing together the classic botanicals of a fernet, and adding these new British elements, we have created our very own style – a London fernet.”

Britannica Fernet is now available in the UK in 500ml bottles at 40% ABV with a recommended retail price of £35.50.

In 2016, Asterley Bros released Dispense amaro, which is made from a blend of 24 botanicals and the brand’s signature vermouth – produced from British pinot noir supplied by Gusbourne Estates in Kent.",Asterley Bros creates Britannica Fernet liqueur using porter beer
Scientists at Nottingham Trent University have created ‘container farms’ capable of producing crops which are said to have bigger yields.,"March 26, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Nottingham.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/uk-scientists-develop-container-farms-to-produce-bigger-crops/,"Scientists at Nottingham Trent University in the UK have created two vertical ‘container farms’ capable of producing crops which are said to be more nutritious and have bigger yields than produce grown in fields.

The farms use a variety of automated feeding and environmental control systems to create the ideal growing conditions all year round. Each container farm is capable of producing three to five tonnes of crops a year.

Scientists at the university’s School of Animal, Rural and Environmental Sciences plan to use the containers for teaching and research – and to showcase the potential for precision agriculture in a time of global challenges for food security and safety. According to the university, nearly 70% of the UK’s fruit and vegetables currently comes from abroad.

The farms have been created as part of a project with scientists at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China.

Produce is grown vertically on racks using various LED light and nutrient ‘recipes’ to stimulate growth, depending on the particular species, variety of crop and its different developmental stages.

Suitable wavelengths of light enhance plant growth, giving crops higher yields, more flavour and increased nutrition.

Plants are also grown using include hydroponics – growing plants without soil in a nutrient-rich solution – and aeroponics, whereby plant roots are suspended mid-air in high humidity while being intermittently misted with a nutrient solution.

Recipes of the 17 different nutrients which control crop quality and flavour are automatically monitored and delivered to each plant via a software-based control system. The scientists said delivering these directly to the roots ensures almost all nutrients are taken up by the plant – hence bigger yields, faster growth and improved nutrition. Only about 30%-40% of nutrients are taken up by the roots when grown in soil.

Chungui Lu, professor of sustainable agriculture at Nottingham Trent University, said: “We want to address food security and sustainable agriculture issues by developing new farming systems which can provide an improved crop quality and yield.”

He added: “We believe that there is enormous potential for urban agriculture and vertical farming to meet these emerging challenges. Container farms have optimum growing conditions from germination right through to harvest. It is a hugely efficient and sustainable way of growing very fresh vegetables and some fruit all year round.

“Container farms the size of ours would be able to produce three to five tonnes of crops per year. Producing natural and sustainable local food under such protected conditions could be very attractive for a range of organisations, such as supermarkets and restaurants. The system is also completely autonomous so people wouldn’t need to know how to operate it.”

BrightFarms, Gotham Greens and Agricool are among urban farming companies to have secured funding in recent months.

France-based Agricool, which is backed by Danone Manifesto Ventures, has developed a technology to grow fruits and vegetables more productively and within small and controlled spaces known as ‘Cooltainers’ (recycled shipping containers transformed into urban farms).

The company said it is responding to reports which suggest that by 2030 20% of products consumed worldwide will come from urban farming – compared to 5% today.",UK scientists develop ‘container farms’ to produce bigger crops

The candy will become a permanent addition to the M&M’s line-up as the second new soft centre innovation after M&M’s caramel, which launched in 2017.

Allison Miazga-Bedrick, M&M’s brand director, said: “Chocolatey hazelnut spread unlocks a side of indulgence that’s all its own, so we wanted to tap into that mania and bring something to life that our fans would go crazy for.

“It’s no secret people love hazelnut spread and love M&M’S, so we can’t wait to see the reaction to this breakthrough taste experience.”

M&M’s hazelnut spread will be available in three pack sizes: singles (1.35oz), share size (2.53oz) and sharing size stand up pouch (8.3oz).

The release follows a range of new M&M’s products launched last year, including a white chocolate peanut variant and a chocolate ice cream sandwich.

In 2017, Mars teamed up with Chinese online retailer JD.com for an exclusive release of sweet and spice M&M’s, combining the original sweet, peanut and chocolate flavour of the candy with hot pepper.

For the three months to 28 February, the maker of Schwartz herbs and French’s mustard posted revenues of $1.23 billion. Operating income was up 8.7% to $196.9 million.

The company’s consumer segment sales were flat when compared to the first quarter of 2018, while flavour solutions segment sales increased 3%. Flavour solutions revenue in the Americas grew 6%, in part due to increased sales to quick service restaurants.

On the back of the strong figures, McCormick expects operating income to grow between 10% and 12% in fiscal 2019. Sales are forecasted to rise between 1% and 3%.

In a conference call, McCormick CEO Lawrence Kurzius said the company is aiming to improve its portfolio to strengthen its relevance for consumers. In the US, it is expanding its McCormick gourmet line with the range of premium salts and peppers. In China, it is relaunching packaging with fresh graphics in a move to drive premium perception and better shelf visibility.

“Consumer segment sales grew in each of our three regions driven by new products, expanded distribution as well as strong marketing programmes and promotional activities,” he said. “Our flavour solutions segment had excellent sales growth driven by increased base business and new product growth in the Americas and EMEA regions. In this segment, we continue to win with our customers through new products, expanded distribution and promotional activities.

“McCormick is a global leader in flavour with a broad and advantaged global portfolio which continues to grow and position us to fully meet the demand for flavour around the world. We are continuing to capitalise on the global and growing consumer interests in healthy, flavourful eating, the source and quality of ingredients, and sustainable practices.”

Last month, McCormick announced a partnership with IBM to use artificial intelligence (AI) for new flavour and food product development. Using IBM technology, McCormick said its product developers will be able to explore flavour territories more quickly and efficiently.

“We feel so fortunate to have found outstanding partners in New Crop and AccelFoods to help propel our brand in this next chapter.”

Cole Orobetz, co-founder and CFO/COO of Alpha Foods, said: “Our benchmark at Alpha Foods is to always create products that are appealing to meat eaters, vegetarians and vegans alike. Plant-based options don’t need to be extreme or polarising anymore.

“More consumers are looking to reduce their meat intake without sacrificing foods they know and love. Our foods have mass-market appeal because they are familiar, easy to prepare and can be enjoyed on the go.”

A key part of the redesign will be reducing the full printed sleeves that cover some of the manufacturer’s bottles. By reducing the sleeves and increasing their transparency, it will make it easier for automated sorting machines to identify the packaging and ensure that each bottle is recycled.

It is the company’s latest move to ensure all its packaging is fully recyclable within the UK’s current recycling infrastructure; the company has already pledged to ensure 100% of its plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025 and is taking “positive steps”, like Fitwater, to ensure new drink launches are designed with bottle-to-bottle recycling in mind.

Michelle Norman, director of external affairs and sustainability at Lucozade Ribena Suntory, said: “Lucozade Ribena Suntory takes its sustainability commitments very seriously and we are extremely proud to be announcing this packaging redesign to ensure our brands continue to be as sustainable as possible. While we continue to make positive changes to our brands it is important that wider changes are made by companies like us, government and industry to ensure recycling rates in the UK can continue to increase.”

Lucozade Ribena Suntory has already trialled Ooho, plastic free biodegradable packaging, to distribute Lucozade Sport to participants at sporting events. It has also invested in “behavioural change initiatives” to help change consumer perceptions of plastic and partnered with Hubbub, an anti-littering charity, to raise awareness and deter littering.

Additionally, the company has made several large investments to ensure its manufacturing process is as sustainable as possible. In 2010, the company invested £70 million to bring bottle production into its Gloucestershire factory, a move designed to reduce its carbon footprint. More recently, Suntory Beverage & Food invested a further £13 million to install a new filler at the factory that will reduce the water and energy used to produce a filled bottle by 40%.

Peter Maddox, director at sustainability charity WRAP, said: “As a founding member of The UK Plastics Pact, I am pleased to see Lucozade Ribena Suntory taking further proactive steps to minimise its impact on the environment. This redesign will help the reprocessing of their drinks bottles and shows that the company continues to take sustainability seriously. I look forward to seeing the results.”",Lucozade Ribena Suntory in overhaul of packaging portfolio

The company is buying a majority stake in Greek ingredients firm Stelios Kanakis Industrial and Commercial (Kanakis), alongside the purchase of Sweden’s Lecora and a minority investment in the owner of Portugal-based Captain Kombucha.

Founded in 1985, Kanakis produces confectionery, bakery and ice cream ingredients. Last year, the firm had a turnover of €20.2 million. Orkla has entered into an agreement to buy the company through its Orkla Food Ingredients subsidiary.

“Kanakis has a leading position in our core categories, in addition to a broad-based network of customers and suppliers who are well-known to Orkla Food Ingredients,” said Johan Clarin, Orkla Food Ingredients CEO. “The company is well-positioned in a region that is seeing good growth.”

Meanwhile, through its Orkla Foods Sverige subsidiary, Orkla has signed and completed an agreement to purchase Lecora, a Swedish manufacturer of frozen and chilled foods and ready meals.

Headquartered in Vadstena, the company had a turnover of SEK 95.9 million ($10.3 million) in 2018, which was primarily generated in Sweden.

Orkla Food Sverige CEO Henrik Julin said: “Orkla holds a leading position in the Swedish grocery trade, in numerous food categories. With the purchase of Lecora, we are strengthening our out-of-home business and expanding our portfolio of organic, vegan and vegetarian food products.”

Finally, Orkla has signed and completed an agreement to purchase 43.5% of the shares of Portuguese company Asteriscos e Reticências, producer of fermented tea-based health drinks that are sold under the Captain Kombucha brand.

Captain Kombucha was established in 2016 and is headquartered in Lisbon, Portugal. The business is currently owned by the two founders (85%) and the German venture capital firm Doehler Ventures (15%), which is financed by the ingredients manufacturer Doehler. After completion of the transaction, the founders will retain an interest of 48.5%, and Doehler will reduce its ownership share to 7.9%.

Orkla Foods International CEO Johan Wilhelmsson said: “In investing in the Captain Kombucha brand we are putting our money on a new and increasingly popular product. The probiotics and organic acids it contains have a positive effect on gut health, which is one of Orkla’s priority areas.”

Called Bombay Sapphire English Estate, the new beverage is said to balance the citrus notes of London dry gin with three new botanicals: pennyroyal mint, rosehip and toasted hazelnut.

Bacardi said the gin captures the essence of the hills and hedgerows that surround the Bombay Sapphire Laverstoke Mill Distillery in Hampshire.

Ivano Tonutti, Bombay Sapphire master of botanicals said: “I am lucky enough to travel the world to source only the finest botanicals to infuse into our heritage gins. However, some of the best ingredients are found right on our doorstep, gathered from the great English countryside.

“These new botanical additions within Bombay Sapphire English Estate have been carefully chosen to complement the existing formula of Bombay Sapphire, resulting in a unique flavour profile, so gin lovers can enjoy a taste of English summertime.”

Bombay Sapphire senior brand ambassador Sam Carter added: “Bombay Sapphire English Estate is a gin with plenty of complexity, but like all our unrivalled products, it is rooted in being of the highest quality.

“A slightly more prominent botanical taste provides an elevation in citrus flavour and is the ideal canvas for many creative cocktail recipes.

“Whether mixed in a spritz, combined with bolder flavours or kept simple in a G&T, it’s the must-have accompaniment to a summer’s day – whether the weather is playing ball or not.”

Bacardi said the launch marks the first of a number of new limited-edition Bombay Sapphire gins to be released in the coming years.

The new gin will be available in the UK as of April with a recommended retail price of £23.

Called Illy Cold Brew Aria, the unit features a tap handle with an adjustable valve that turns cold brew with bubbles into a “richer-tasting and effervescent experience”.

A patent-pending valve captures ambient air – already containing 78% nitrogen – that is immediately infused at high pressure into Illy cold brew coffee as it’s dispensed. The combination is said to create a cascading effect and a rich, creamy head.

The valve is adjustable and able to vary the levels of air and effervescence infused into cold brew, all the way down to no bubbles at all.

Illycaffè said Cold Brew Aria “is the only system that can produce either effervescent or regular cold brew with only one tap handle and one coffee source”.

The product arrives as cold coffee sales are booming. A study last year by Mintel suggested that one in five new coffee launches in 2017 was iced and ready to drink.

In the US, more than half (56%) of new RTD coffee launches in the US were cold brew in 2017, according to Mintel.

To pair with Cold Brew Aria, Illycaffè has released Bag-in-a-Box, a five-litre soft package filled with Illy cold brew, eliminating the need for space-consuming kegs.

Based in Huddersfield, Magic Rock employs 45 people and now aims to meet rising demand for its portfolio in the UK. The business also exports to more than 25 countries and sees opportunities to further grow outside of the UK with the support of Lion.

Magic Rock said it is close to maxing out the capacity of its current brewery, adding that the deal will allow it to purchase better equipment and produce better beer in larger quantities.

Lion launched its international unit in 2015 to take the company’s Australian and New Zealand craft beers and ciders into new markets and accelerate the growth of its wine business in North America.

The announcement follows Lion’s recent acquisitions of Four Pillars Gin and Teza Iced Teas. Last week, the firm’s US wine business, Distinguished Vineyards & Wine Partners, bought both Markham Vineyards and Textbook Wines. And last July, Lion bought British craft beer brand Fourpure.

Magic Rock co-founder and managing director Richard Burhouse, said: “With the support of the beer community, in eight years Magic Rock has become one of the UK’s leading craft brewers, distributing across the UK, as well as internationally. The best way for us to build on this legacy over the long term is to introduce Magic Rock beers to a much wider audience.

“We’re excited to be joining one of the world’s best brewing experts under the shared promise to keep making great beer, on a bigger scale, through their knowledge, expertise and investment.”

Anheuser-Busch InBev will rename its UK business 'Budweiser Brewing Group UK&I' as part of its continued transformation following the merger with SABMiller.,"March 25, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CDF_220319_GE_Budweiser_Brewing_Magor_23.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/new-name-for-anheuser-busch-uk-as-part-of-ongoing-transformation/,"Anheuser-Busch InBev will rename its UK business ‘Budweiser Brewing Group UK&I’ as part of its continued transformation, following its merger with SABMiller and subsequent divestment of brands such as Meantime and Grolsch.

On top of the name change, the company will open a new London headquarters and renew several CSR ambitions – including a target to become “the UK’s most sustainable brewer” as it works towards brewing with renewable electricity and locally sourced barley.

Anheuser-Busch, the world’s largest beer maker, said the move would introduce “a more recognisable name that drives awareness of the group and brings people together”. The Budweiser brand was selected because it is “the brewer’s most famous global brand”.

Budweiser Brewing Group’s new president, Paula Lindenberg, said: “We are a fast-paced, ambitious group that dreams big, and we have exciting plans ahead for the UK and Ireland. Through the power and recognition of the Budweiser brand, we want to open ourselves up to working with more partners to achieve our ambitions.

“We are looking forward to making a big impact in the year ahead, working towards brewing our beers with 100% renewable electricity and accelerating our progress towards 20% of our global products being no or low alcohol.”

The move to ensure its barley and electricity are both sourced from within the UK could be interpreted as a last-minute attempt to protect its UK business from the effects of Brexit.

With less than three weeks to go and still no certainty of a deal between London and Brussels, the prospect of a no-deal departure has never been higher; for companies with large operations in the UK, like AB InBev, reducing its dependency on European ingredients and supply chains – for the short term, at least – seems like a sensible measure.

The company, which had already announced its intention to make its beer in the UK using renewable energy, has a broad portfolio of brands in the UK including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Corona, Bass and Boddington’s.",Anheuser-Busch UK renamed as part of ongoing transformation

Mondelēz will work with the non-profit to offer educational opportunities and mentorship to entrepreneurs active in Chicago’s food and drink scene.

The partnership is one of several investments the company is making as part of SnackFutures – the firm’s innovation and venture hub that was launched last October and is aimed at unlocking snacking growth opportunities globally.

Through the collaboration, Mondelēz and SnackFutures aim to be able to connect with the local food and beverage start-up community and work together to accelerate and scale innovation.

Joining Pilgrim’s in March 2011, Penn has also served as senior vice president of the commercial business group and executive vice president of sales and operations.

“Jayson Penn has enjoyed a distinguished career in the poultry industry and has played an integral role in the success of Pilgrim’s over the last eight years,” said Gilberto Tomazoni, Pilgrim’s Pride chairman of the board of directors.

“Since joining the company in March 2011, Jayson has exemplified the leadership qualities, passion to succeed and business acumen that make him the ideal candidate to assume this role. The board’s decision is further validation of the Pilgrim’s strategy, implemented in 2012, to create a unique, diversified portfolio across multiple geographies, with a focus on key customers and operational excellence, to generate more consistent and higher margins.

Revenue dropped 1% to NZD 9.7 billion ($6.63 billion), as the company’s Australia ingredients business was impacted by drought, leading to a decline in milk collections in the country.

Fonterra is currently carrying out a major financial review, which was implemented after the firm posted a NZD 196 million ($128.5 million) loss for the 2018 financial year.

The company today announced it aims to sell its 50% stake in DFE Pharma, a joint venture established in 2006 between Fonterra and FrieslandCampina, which supplies pharmaceutical excipients.

It has also offloaded its interest in its Venezuelan consumer joint venture Corporacíon Inlaca to international food business Mirona.

Meanwhile, the firm said it has received “strong interest” in Tip Top ice cream brand, which it announced it would consider selling last year, and is “actively considering its options” for its shareholding in Beingmate.

Miles Hurrell, who was permanently appointed as Fonterra’s CEO earlier this month after serving as interim chief executive since last August, said the company is “well on track” to reduce debt by the end of the year by NZD 800 million ($546.8 million).

“The steady performance from New Zealand ingredients in the first half of FY19 has been offset by challenges in Australia ingredients and this has seen our total ingredients EBIT decline by 17% to NDZ 461 million ($315 million),” he said.

“Our Australia ingredients business continues to feel the impact of the drought. We can see it in the decline of Australian milk collections and aggressive price competition for milk, which is resulting in the underutilisation of manufacturing assets and tightening margins.”

He added: “Our three-point plan involves taking stock of our business and conducting a portfolio review, getting the basics right and improving our forecasting. We’ve made good progress so far and we will continue to take these steps in the second half to firm up our foundations and strengthen our balance sheet.

“The second half will also see us continuing the work on developing a new strategy to support a much-needed change in direction. We are doing the right things but it’s clear more is needed to lift our performance. We need to simplify and improve the co-op so we can grow value.”","Fonterra returns to profitability, plans to sell stake in DFE Pharma"
AAK aims to help food manufacturers create artisanal-style pizzas with a new range of flaked fats that are said to enhance crust taste and texture.,"March 19, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AAK2.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/aak-creates-new-flaked-fats-to-enhance-taste-of-pizza-crusts/,"AAK aims to help food manufacturers create artisanal-style pizzas with a new range of flaked fats that are said to enhance crust taste and texture – as well as offer easy handling during the production process.

The company said the products provide a simple way to improve the mouthfeel of crusts in both thin and deep pan pizzas.

Visual appeal is also said to be improved, as the fats create air pockets in pizzas and a more open dough structure.

Rasa Moorthamer, business development director at AAK, said: “Today’s consumers want pizzas with artisan quality, taste and texture. Our expertise in vegetable oils and fats ensure our flaked fats give the premium pizza experience consumers are looking for.

“This versatile solution allows for the creation of a tasty product that can make production simpler, while opening the door to unique sensory experiences, whether the pizza is sold frozen, chilled, fresh, or as a dry-mix.”

Sweden-headquartered AAK said that if using flavoured flakes, the taste is encapsulated in the flake until the pizza is baked and the fat starts to melt, resulting in an enhanced flavour.

Finally, the flaked fats are said to reduce oiling out – the oil migration from the crust that can make home-delivery boxes soggy. Preventing oiling out can allow for a better crust texture and has the extra benefit that consumers’ hands will get less greasy if they pick up their pizza to eat.

Last week, AAK announced it will invest around SEK 300 million ($31.9 million) to increase capacity at its facility in Zhangjiagang, China, adding additional capacity in the bakery segment to meet demand for its high-end bakery solutions.

The expansion will also include a processing plant for the company’s special nutrition unit, focusing on the production of infant nutrition solution INFAT, sold through Advanced Lipids, a joint venture between AAK and IFF.",AAK creates new flaked fats to enhance taste of pizza crusts

Turkey Hill produces a range of iced teas, fruit drinks, milk, frozen dairy products and ice creams. As part of the sale agreement, the Peak Rock Capital affiliate will continue to operate the Turkey Hill business out of its Conestoga, Pennsylvania, facility.

“We believe this is the right step to ensure the Turkey Hill business can meet its full potential and continue to grow its successful ice cream and beverage brands,” said Erin Sharp, group vice president for Kroger Manufacturing.

“Throughout this process, we were extremely impressed with Peak Rock’s professionalism and vision for the future of the Turkey Hill business. We look forward to working with them to ensure a smooth and successful transition for all parties.”

Peak Rock Capital managing director Robert Pistilli said: “Turkey Hill represents an exciting opportunity to invest in a premier brand with an established reputation for quality, flavour variety, and authenticity, within the large and growing ice cream and refrigerated drinks space.

“We are impressed with the accomplishments of the business under the stewardship of Kroger and look forward to completing a seamless transition of the business to a standalone entity and partnering with Turkey Hill’s management team to drive significant growth through continued product innovation.”

In total, four craft beers, four heritage beers, two ciders and an alcoholic ginger beer have been released.

The design of the four traditional beers is a subtle reimagining of the original Billson’s labels from 70 years ago. The most distinctive elements of those designs have been brought to the fore: the ostrich and kangaroo appear on the Prize Ale and flags feature on the Stout label.

“We took away the unnecessary elements, keeping only the parts that resonate today, and reworking them for a modern eye,” said Samantha Dumont, creative director at Cowan London.

“We also retained a sense of imperfection with a nod to the original handcrafted label designs. It’s the contrast of this traditional Australian imagery against the silver cans, with the Billson’s logo written in confident, bold typography that makes these designs pop.”

Meanwhile, packaging for the four craft beers draws inspiration from the brewery itself: a copper kettle for the Pale Ale can, the two chimneys for Lager, a 1950s Chevrolet truck for Golden Ale, and one of the brewery’s collection of horse-drawn carts on the Porter can.

The story behind each item is told on the back of the cans and the range is unified by the use of a vivid colour palette set against a matt finish.

Billson’s marketing manager Julia Vesval said: “Packaging design is critical in beers and ciders. We needed to find a way to convey the rich heritage of Billson’s but in a way that will connect with a contemporary audience.

“We needed a design team imbued with a sense of both Australian culture and cutting-edge craft beer design cues.”

Billson’s was founded in 1865 when Englishman George Billson started making drinks from the Australian Alpine spring water rising from the ground at Beechworth, north-east Victoria. In 2017 new owners came in, inspired by this heritage and eager to breathe new life into the brewer.

The new drinks take the total number of products launched and relaunched since the new owners took over to 39, including new small-batch sodas, which were introduced earlier this year.

“It’s inspiring to be part of a project that’s moving at such a pace,” added Dumont. “It requires a very entrepreneurial approach, with us adapting, developing and building the brand through each design. It’s also incredibly refreshing to be working with a brewery that can credibly play into the world of both heritage and modern craft.”",Billson’s debuts alcoholic drinks with designs by Cowan London

The snack company added more than $300 million in additional revenue compared to the same period last year, while operating profit rose by 14.4% to reach $651 million.

The Minneapolis-based firm has stabilised under CEO Jeff Harmening but has faced recent retail struggles in North America, its largest market, which saw declines in net sales of 2% and 3.4% respectively in its first and second quarters.

North America retail sales this quarter essentially matched the same period last year, General Mills said, with organic net sales growing modestly.

General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening said: “We had a strong third quarter, with positive organic sales growth and significant operating margin expansion. Our year-to-date performance and fourth-quarter plans give us confidence that we will meet or exceed all of our key fiscal 2019 targets. For the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted EPS and free cash flow conversion will exceed our initial targets, net sales will finish toward the lower end of our guidance range, and adjusted operating profit will finish toward the higher end of the range.

“Our improved execution and strengthened performance this year reinforce our view that a balanced approach to top and bottom-line growth, centred on our Consumer First strategy, will drive long-term value for our shareholders.”

The company is still $400 million stronger in revenue terms than Harmening’s first quarter as CEO, when the firm turned over $3.77 billion.

And it is in a better place generally since Harmening replaced Ken Powell as CEO, delivering back-to-back year-on-year growth and helping to re-focus the company’s efforts on stabilising and improving top-line performance.

In September 2017, General Mills vowed to continue prioritising its top line after net sales for the first quarter of its financial year fell by 4%, with Harmening calling it his “number one priority” as CEO.",General Mills 8% stronger as third-quarter sales reach $4.2bn

Clearly Drinks said that with the introduction of the UK’s sugar tax last year, Upstream is positioned in the emerging subcategory of zero-sugar premium flavoured waters.

The name and design of Upstream aim to embody the brand’s promise that the drink will offer a moment to refresh, step back and appreciate the positive things in life.

Ed Woolner from Upstream said: “We wanted to create a zero-sugar, low-calorie flavoured water that didn’t compromise on quality and offered a daily dose of refreshment.

“There are so many health-conscious consumers out there on the search for something different, presenting an opportunity for retailers to tap into the zero-sugar and low-calorie trend to drive sales.”

Upstream drinks are available in the UK in 330ml aluminium cans with a recommended retail price of £0.99.

"Agrana has invested €22m to open a new fruit preparation facility in Changzhou, China, its third production facility in the country...","March 19, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Agrana-Fruit-Eröffnung-Changzhou.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/agrana-invests-22m-euros-to-open-new-fruit-preparation-facility/,"Fruit, starch and sugar producer Agrana has invested €22 million to open a new fruit preparation facility in Changzhou, China, its third production facility in the country.

According to Agrana, the new site will be capable of producing 30,000 tonnes of prepared fruit a year, including strawberries, blueberries and peaches for the fruit yoghurt, bakery, ice cream and foodservice sectors.

The construction of the new facility was made necessary by the projected growth of the yogurt market in China and the subsequent increase in demand for fruit ingredients.

Statistics provided by research agency Euromonitor International estimate that the Chinese yogurt market has nearly doubled in the past five years, and will grow an average of 7.9% annually until 2023.

Agrana CEO, Stephan Büttner said: “We are delighted to be opening this new site after just one year of construction work. China is the world’s largest yoghurt market and is growing fast.

“Their locations mean that our production facilities are in close proximity to major dairy product customers. The construction of a second fruit preparations site in the Shanghai region was therefore a logical investment in order to consolidate our market leadership.”",Agrana invests 22m euros to open new fruit preparation site
"At Expo West 2019, FoodBev spoke with Julie Smolyansky, CEO of Lifeway Foods, about the growing trends towards plant-based dairy alternatives and kefir","March 19, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-194.jpg,https://www.foodbev.com/news/interview-lifeway-foods-talks-about-growth-in-dairy-alternatives-kefir/,"As for kefir – the high-protein cultured milk smoothie leading the fermented foods revolution – Smolyansky has a personal connection to the product.

“Kefir is a 2,000-year-old product that originated in the Caucus Mountains and it has a rich folklore history, very artisanal quality and style of production,” she says. “My parents and I were refugees from the former Soviet Union and when they came to the United States, they realised that there was no kefir. They really missed this product, and they needed it for their health; they use it preventatively for all these medical conditions.

“They launched Lifeway over 30 years ago, and we’ve been really leading the conversation about the benefits of kefir, of probiotics, of fermented foods. The science and research now is finally catching up to what our ancestors have known all along: that when they consume kefir, they experience a sense of wellbeing and of good feeling. It’s considered a gift from the Gods.

“This story is so rich, and when you combine this great folklore and history with today’s science and research, and the quality that Lifeway has brought to this category… it’s really a powerful combination.”","Interview: Lifeway Foods talks growth in dairy alternatives, kefir"
"Makers of high-protein falafel, gluten-free empanadas and frozen fruits are among the start-ups selected to take part in Chobani’s spring 2019 incubator.","March 19, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cocina54.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/chobani-launches-its-most-diverse-incubator-selects-eight-start-ups/,"Makers of high-protein falafel, gluten-free empanadas and frozen fruits are among the start-ups selected to take part in Chobani’s spring 2019 incubator.

Chobani said the class brings together a diverse mix of backgrounds, perspectives and culinary inspirations.

With eight start-ups taking part, the class is the most diverse cohort in the programme’s history, across genders, geographies, race and ethnicity, and country of origin.

Underrepresented minority founders make up 75% of the class, while 63% of brand founders or co-founders are female.

Running since 2016, the Chobani incubator programme aims to help entrepreneurs break into food and beverage industries through equity-free investment and a focus on mentorship.

Chobani founder and CEO, Hamdi Ulukaya, dreamed up the initiative and he selects all the final participants and spends time getting to know and mentor each company.
• Afia Foods (Texas) – uses Syrian recipes for frozen, protein-forward falafel and kibbeh made with Halal certified meat.
• Cocina 54 (Texas) – makes a range of frozen empanadas that aim to meet consumer demands for international flavours.
• The Meat Hook (New York) – a Brooklyn-based butcher with a focus on meat from small, family-run farms in New York.
• Mason Dixie Biscuit Co (Washington DC) – creates a range of preservative- and additive-free biscuits using real dairy and butter.
• Cannonborough Beverage Company (South Carolina) – produces four core soda flavours and a dozen seasonal items based on farmers’ varieties.
• Edesia Nutrition / MeWe (Rhode Island) – non-profit Edesia makes ready-to-use therapeutic foods for malnourished children around the world.
• Seal the Seasons (North Carolina) – sells 37 frozen food items in a variety of flavours, including blueberries, strawberries and peaches.
• Thaifusions (Washington) – makes sauces and curries based on family recipes that reflect the founders’ Thai heritage.

Chobani said the first two classes to participate in the incubator have, on average, achieved a 68% increase in distribution and a 67% increase in annual revenue in 2018 from the year-ago period. Overall, alumni have collectively raised more than $60 million since the programme’s inception in 2016.

Last May, Chobani launched an incubator programme with a focus on food tech and ag-tech start-ups for the first time. Called the Food Tech Residency, the scheme saw the dairy company aim to respond to pressing issues within the food and beverage industry.

When the initiative was launched, Chobani incubator director at Jackie Miller told FoodBev: “As a food maker on the front lines of the supply chain, Chobani wants to give those with technical expertise access to our knowledge, network and resources to build better innovative solutions that can make an impact on food systems at scale.”",Chobani’s new incubator is most diverse in programme’s history
"Hi-Cone, the manufacturer of ring carriers for the beverage industry, has partnered with TerraCycle to encourage consumers to recycle the plastic carriers.","March 19, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Hi-Cone.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/hi-cone-and-terracycle-partner-to-recycle-plastic-ring-carriers/,"Hi-Cone, the manufacturer of ring carriers for the beverage industry, has partnered with TerraCycle to encourage consumers to recycle the plastic carriers.

The new recycling scheme, which will launch in May 2019, will create a UK-wide network of public access ring carrier recycling points. Community groups and individual consumers are encouraged to set up locations for their communities, where the public can drop off ring carriers post-use, which can be sent, free of charge, to TerraCycle for recycling.

According to the British Plastics Federation, 99% of local authorities in the UK collect plastic bottles at the curbside, and 76% collect pots, tubs and trays. However, items such as ring carriers are collected and recycled by very few authorities.

As a result, Hi-Cone and TerraCycle now aim to spearhead the effort to ensure ring carriers can be collected and recycled, allowing them to have a new life post-use as items such as park benches, outdoor furniture and composite lumber.

Hi-Cone president Kenneth Escoe said: “We are extremely excited to be launching this new initiative with TerraCycle, which means that our product is now fully recyclable in the UK. Moving forward, our goal is to recover and reuse as many plastic ring carriers as possible worldwide, and the TerraCycle partnership helps us to achieve that. Hi-Cone has long been dedicated to reducing its environmental impact and this latest project forms part of a broader strategy that will ensure ring carriers are 100% recyclable or compostable by 2025.

“It is vital that packaging producers take the lead in pushing sustainable programmes forward, and that is why we have stepped in at this stage of our own journey to champion this process with TerraCycle. We will be monitoring the progress of this initiative very closely as it rolls out in the UK, and will then assess the possibility of widening its scope further into Europe, the US and beyond.”

Laure Cucuron, general manager at TerraCycle Europe, added: “To date, we have some 80 million people engaged in collecting waste materials across 21 countries and typically these programmes are funded by brands or municipalities.

“It is therefore very refreshing to have a packaging manufacturer such as Hi-Cone engaging with us and taking responsibility for the materials it sends into circulation. We have a shared responsibility to close the material loop and we would encourage more packaging producers to work with us and to follow the example Hi-Cone is setting.”

Earlier this month, Intersnack Group subsidiary KP Snacks partnered with TerraCycle to launch a recycling scheme for its packs of nuts, popcorn, crisps and pretzels.

Packaging will be cleaned and made into small plastic pellets, which will then ultimately be recycled into items including outdoor furniture, waste bins or storage boxes.",Hi-Cone partners with TerraCycle to recycle plastic ring can carriers

“Paula brings a deep understanding of our business, the marketplace and our consumers in Latin America, and commercial expertise across both the food and beverage categories.

“She has a proven track record of delivering results, while also advancing diversity and inclusion. I am absolutely confident she is the ideal leader for this key sector as we work to get closer to our consumers and capture new growth opportunities.

National Agricultural Development Company (Nadec) has hired GEA to build and supply the equipment for a new olive oil mill in Saudi Arabia.,"March 20, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Olive-oil.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/gea-partners-with-nadec-to-build-new-olive-oil-mill-in-saudi-arabia/,"National Agricultural Development Company (Nadec) has hired GEA to build and supply the equipment for a new olive oil mill in Saudi Arabia.

The order marks the second phase of an ongoing project and will enlarge the existing olive oil plant located in the region of Al-Jouf.

GEA said the contract follows on from the successful completion of the first phase, as well as a collaboration with Nadec in the dairy products sector.

The construction, which will include all necessary industrial equipment to manage the olive oil plant successfully, will be led by GEA and will include the combined efforts of several Spanish machine manufacturers.

Rafael Cárdenas, head of the Center of Excellence for Olive Oil of GEA, said: “We were able to offer Nadec a differentiated and integrated solution from the hands of a single supplier.”

Alvaro Martinez, GEA regional head of Western Europe, Middle East and Africa, added: “The cooperative relationship between Nadec and GEA’s Olive Oil Center of Excellence began in 2014. This project is a very good example of GEA’s ability to deliver large projects anywhere in the world and provide high added value to customers since not only the equipment but also the knowledge of the process is key.”

Last July, Germany-headquartered GEA partnered with dairy company Almarai to build what the companies described as Saudi Arabia’s “largest and most modern dairy processing facility”.

Located in Al Kharj, the plant includes multiple production lines for a range of milk and yogurt products and has the capacity to process 2 million litres of milk a day.

Last month, GEA secured a contract to construct a new infant formula plant in China for Shijiazhuang Junlebao Dairy. A GEA spokesperson said the new facility “will be the largest of its kind in China”.",GEA partners with Nadec to build new olive oil mill in Saudi Arabia
Recycling group Veolia and UK-based restaurant chain Leon have teamed up to trial a deposit-return scheme in the UK...,"March 20, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/RVM-receipt-1024x683.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/veolia-and-leon-trial-deposit-return-scheme-in-london/,"Recycling group Veolia and UK-based restaurant chain Leon have teamed up to trial a deposit-return scheme in the UK.

Located in King’s Cross, London, the reverse vending machine pilot has been designed to target the disposable drinks containers most commonly discarded on the go – bottles up to 750ml and aluminium cans – making it easy for consumers to recycle, reduce littering and enable more materials to be salvaged.

The trial will initially run for six months, and consumers will receive a voucher for 10% off at the nearest Leon restaurant once they deposit a plastic bottle up to 750ml or an aluminium can.

Veolia estimates that Britain fails to recycle 40% of plastic bottles because they aren’t placed in the right bins, meaning that an estimated 240,000 go to landfill or enter the environment every year.

A formal UK-wide deposit-return scheme has been touted as a solution to this problem, and UK retailers including Iceland, Tesco and The Co-Op have launched reverse vending trials in the last year.

Richard Kirkman, chief technology and innovation officer, Veolia UK & Ireland said: “A UK-wide deposit-return scheme is imperative if we want to round up the millions of stray plastic bottles and cans we as a country are not recycling.

“This pilot Veolia is conducting with Leon is the yardstick for on the go recycling. Located in a high footfall area and targeting the drinks containers most commonly misplaced – plastic bottles up to 750ml and aluminium cans – the machine offers an alternative to carrying recyclable items home or discarding as litter.

“Our research shows people are motivated to recycle, they care about the environment and the vast majority are poised to use a machine like ours when a reasonable walk away.

“Veolia will collect and process the machine’s contents, ultimately transporting the bottles and cans to be recycled into new products. We hope as the pilot unfolds, it proves the importance of recycling on the go as well as the need for appropriate infrastructure to facilitate it.”

John Vincent, CEO & Co-Founder of Leon, said: “At Leon we’ve been committed to being the most sustainable business we can be since we opened our first restaurant in 2004.

“Through our Planet LOVe programme launched in 2019, we will carry on investing in new ways to reduce single-use plastics and find better recycling solutions because, put simply, the planet needs us to.

“We’re really excited about this partnership with Veolia because we know that, as an industry, we need to push for the right facilities and infrastructure to ensure better recycling and reuse – this is a great step forward.

“And we can’t wait to welcome all the recycling warriors into our restaurants and reward their efforts with a little thank you from us.”",Veolia and Leon trial deposit return scheme in London

Called Valor Siren Ventures, the unit will be managed by investment firm Valor Equity Partners and will aim to serve as a growth driver for the next generation of food and retail start-ups.

The Starbucks $100 million commitment is the first of its kind for the company, and the new fund will seek to raise an additional $300 million in the coming months from other partners.

Under the leadership of CEO Kevin Johnson, Starbucks said it is looking to grow with focus and discipline, embracing innovations that are relevant to its customers.

“We believe that innovative ideas are fuel for the future, and we continue to build on this heritage inside our company across beverage, experiential retail, and our digital flywheel,” said Johnson.

“At the same time, and with an eye toward accelerating our innovation agenda, we are inspired by, and want to support the creative, entrepreneurial businesses of tomorrow with whom we may explore commercial relationships down the road.

“This new partnership with Valor presents exciting opportunities, not only for these start-ups, but also for Starbucks, as we build an enduring company for decades to come.”

Valor Equity Partners founder and managing partner Antonio Gracias said: “As experienced investors in food and retail technology, we are thrilled to partner with Starbucks, one of the most iconic and forward-thinking global brands. Under our partner Jon Shulkin’s leadership, we are incredibly excited to partner with Starbucks to drive innovation in the food and retail industries.”

Last month, Nestlé released its first range of Starbucks-branded coffee products, following the agreement to acquire the rights to the American coffee chain’s retail brand for $7.15 billion last May.

The new line includes a variety of signature Starbucks blends and single-origin coffees, as well as a selection of classic beverages such as caramel macchiato and cappuccino.

Nordzucker will invest €100m in its sugar processing operation in southern Sweden – but will consolidate by closing one factory.,"March 19, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-1.png?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/nordzucker-to-invest-100m-euros-in-swedish-sugar-production-operation/,"Nordzucker will consolidate its sugar production in southern Sweden, closing one factory and investing €100 million in another.

The company will close its refinery in Arlöv, north of Malmö, moving production to its plant in Örtofta 20km away. To make way for the extra capacity, Nordzucker will invest in Örtofta’s production methods and technologies, as well as an investment in the environment.

The first steps have already been taken with an extensive modernisation of Örtofta’s sugarhouse, which will be completed before the 2019 campaign. In the years to come, the investments will include building a high rack warehouse, rebuilding Nordzucker’s service centre, and adding a new liquid and syrup facility.

The entire project is expected to be completed in autumn 2021.

“We have come far in the planning and I look forward to being ready for the next stage,” said Nordzucker’s chief operations officer, Axel Aumüller. “With the consolidation, we not only ensure a long-term sustainable structure in Sweden, we also get a modern factory with efficient energy-optimised production and significant savings in the long term. [It is] an important step to position ourselves as a stable, profitable and competitive player in the sugar market.”

Katarina Silfversparre, managing director for the Swedish subsidiary Nordic Sugar, added: “I am very pleased that on the basis of this decision, we, in close cooperation with our beet growers, ensure the deliveries of Swedish sugar to our customers for the future. The consolidation will mean a reduction in the number of employees in the Swedish operations. It means a lot to me that we can handle this and the closure of the factory in Arlöv with internal relocation and natural retirement.”

The investments mean that energy consumption in Nordzucker’s Swedish sugar production can be reduced by 20%, and CO2 emissions by 18,000 tonnes per year. In addition, more rational logistics mean that transport by truck can be significantly reduced, with an increased part of the transports being done by rail.

Together with a silo inaugurated in 2017, and the energy-efficiency measures implemented in Örtofta in recent years, the new investments mean that the company has invested around €150 million in strategic projects to secure the competitiveness of its Swedish sugar production in the future.

It comes at a time of intense pressure for global sugar processors, in the face of universal backlash from health-conscious consumers.

Many producers are finding alternative ingredient categories, driving efficiencies, or consolidating their operations to secure a more viable future.

But Nordzucker is still planning for growth, too: in February, it announced a deal to

Called Kulture Clash Clear Mind, the 6.9% ABV beverage blends Brew Dr. Clear Mind kombucha and a Rogue imperial blonde ale and will be available for a limited time as of 1 April.

Opening with bright notes of citrus, the beverage is said to have subtle flavours of rosemary, mint, sage and green tea. The companies said the beer kombucha hybrid is “incredibly smooth and perfect for incorporating into a self-care Sunday routine”.

The launch marks the second in the Kulture Clash series between the two firms, following a similar launch in 2018.

Rogue Ales & Spirits president Dharma Tamm said: “We loved last year’s Kulture Clash so much we knew we had to do something with Brew Dr. again this year.

“We loved pairing our imperial blonde ale with Clear Mind kombucha — the imperial blonde rounds out the mint and sage notes of the kombucha. The combination creates a really delicious spring beer.”

Matt Thomas, founder and CEO of Brew Dr. Kombucha, added: “The image of Otis the sloth levitating and meditating on the front of the bottle embodies how we like to feel every day, but especially on Sundays. He’s so mellow and serene, and after drinking Kulture Clash Clear Mind, so are we.”

Called Äppelblom (apple blossom in Swedish), the seasonal whisky is “reminiscent of spring and fresh green apples in both taste and design”.

The limited-edition beverage is a result of a collaboration between Mackmyra and calvados producer Christian Drouin. Mackmyra master blender Angela D’Orazio worked with Christian and his son Guillaume to create the 46.1% ABV beverage, which is said to be “fruity and lightly spiced”.

D’Orazio said: “The choice of calvados producer was easy. Christian Drouin creates absolutely fantastic calvados in all respects, with genuine craftsmanship in every product since 1965, he has challenged French traditions in this area and is therefore the perfect match for Mackmyra’s approach and our enjoyment of experimenting.

“The light apple tones from our whisky, in combination with the more mature apple flavours from the calvados, give Äppelblom a generous cask character with a fine spicy balance.”

Guillaume Drouin, managing director at Calvados Christian Drouin, added: “Calvados is a delicate and fruity spirit. When discovering Äppelblom, I was very impressed by the delicate marriage between the pear and citrus notes of the whisky with the apple and oxidative flavours given by our casks. The result is a very expressive and elegant whisky, which will be just perfect at springtime.

“Since we have a very long ageing for our calvados we hardly get the opportunity to use them for a second fill, therefore I was happy to see the result of this innovative ageing using one of the very few casks we ship from our cellar.”

Located in Healesville on the outskirts of Melbourne, Four Pillars was founded by Cameron Mackenzie, Stuart Gregor and Matt Jones in December 2013. Its portfolio on gins includes Rare Dry, Spiced Negroni, Navy Strength and Bloody Shiraz.

On the back of the investment, the company is now looking to boost sales globally.

“The partnership with Lion really is a ripper for us,” said Stuart Gregor. “It would not be untrue to say that more than a few organisations have shown an interest in us over the past 18 months and Lion just felt the best.

“We like their focus on craft, we like the fact we will be their first and most important craft spirit brand, and we like the fact that part of the deal is a slab of Furphy every month for the rest of our lives.”

“We have a terrific relationship with the senior management at Lion and reckon this is the start of a really exciting new chapter for our business.”

Lion is part of the Lion Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Japan’s Kirin Holdings. The company’s portfolio of beer brands includes James Squire, Malt Shovel, Kosciuszko and Furphy.

Lion managing director James Brindley said: “The partnership with Four Pillars is really exciting for Lion, as we venture into new categories outside our core beer business.

“What Matt, Cam and Stu have done in creating Four Pillars in just over five years is nothing short of remarkable and we want them to keep their hands on the wheel, while we offer advice, counsel and assistance.”

Last July, Lion acquired British craft beer brand Fourpure, as part of efforts to gain a foothold in the European craft beer market.

The company will add a smoky ginger ale, spiced orange ginger ale and a ‘refreshingly light’ version of its premium ginger ale.

Sourced from Ivory Coast, Nigeria and India, the variety of gingers used in the drinks add “a freshness and aroma” that “complements the large variation of flavours” found in fine spirits, Fever-Tree said. The drinks will go on sale this spring with a suggested retail price of $5.99 for a pack of four 200ml bottles.

Fever-Tree USA CEO Charles Gibb said: “We see enormous opportunity for the Fever-Tree ginger range. Ginger ale represents more than half of the mixer category and is a $1.1 billion market. Moreover, our selection of three different gingers from three diverse regions ensures that we deliver an authentic, dynamic and real ginger taste on the palate.”

“Our ginger expressions pair exceptionally well with whisky, as well as other aged spirits such as cognac, brandy and rum. These exciting and dynamic spirits categories are enjoying fantastic growth. They deserve the right mixer to complement their diverse flavour profiles, because ‘if three quarters of your drink is the mixer, mix with the best’. After all, the craftsmanship of an exceptional spirit deserves the most delicious mixer.”

Ginger as a flavour has seen enormous traction in recent years, with Pepsi, Coca-Cola and Johnnie Walker all experimenting with the root flavour. Fever-Tree has thrown in a number of other beverage trends including smoky and spicy flavours, as well as a lower-calorie version.

Fever-Tree Refreshingly Light Ginger Ale blends fruit sugars with the same gingers used in the brand’s regular range for a 47% reduction in calories.

Fever-Tree USA marketing director Amanda Stackman concluded: “Fever-Tree revolutionised the tonic category by largely focusing on gin, which accounts for only 6% of spirits sales.

Packaging company Sealed Air has joined forces with Japanese firm Kuraray for a project to produce plant-based food packaging.,"March 25, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sealed-Air-MGM.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/sealed-air-partners-with-kuraray-for-plant-based-food-packaging/,"Packaging company Sealed Air has joined forces with Japanese firm Kuraray for a project to produce plant-based food packaging.

Sealed Air will spend $24 million to upgrade its facility in Simpsonville, South Carolina, to make materials made from Kuraray’s Plantic brand plant-based resin and post-consumer plastic. The expansion is underway and production is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2020.

To support this work, Kuraray is investing approximately $15 million to install plant-based high barrier resin production and supporting capabilities in Houston, Texas. The resin plant is scheduled to be completed at the end of September 2019 and will begin operating in early 2020.

In June 2018, Sealed Air and Kuraray America entered into an agreement to offer Plantic materials to package perishable foods such as poultry, beef and seafood in the US, Canada and Mexico.

As upgrades to both facilities progress, Sealed Air, under the agreement with Kuraray, will continue to serve customers in North America by importing materials from Plantic Australia.

Sealed Air CEO Ted Doheny said: “This collaborative effort with Kuraray expands our ability to deliver innovative, sustainable food packaging solutions that leave our world, environment and communities better than we found them.

“This investment also helps us reach our commitment to deliver 100% recyclable or reusable packaging offerings, and 50% average recycled content across all packaging solutions by 2025.”

Katsumasa Yamaguchi, Kuraray general manager of the global EVAL division, added: “Kuraray continues to pioneer proprietary technology to develop new fields of business, grow globally and improve the environment.

“We are looking forward to this collaborative investment with Sealed Air, which allows us to produce and offer a high-performing plant-based packaging option to the food industry on a much larger scale.”

Last month, Sealed Air acquired Philippines-based packaging producer MGM to expand its printing and lamination capabilities and better serve customers throughout the Asia Pacific region.",Sealed Air partners with Kuraray for plant-based food packaging
Nestlé has launched new variants of Rowntree’s Randoms to coincide with the fruit-flavoured sweet range’s tenth anniversary.,"March 25, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rowntrees.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/nestle-releases-new-rowntrees-randoms-alongside-brand-refresh/,"Nestlé has launched new variants of Rowntree’s Randoms to coincide with the fruit-flavoured sweet range’s tenth anniversary. The introduction coincides with a major refresh of the Rowntree’s brand.

Sharing bags containing only Squish’ems (squishy foam and fruity jelly in one sweet), Foamies (foamy sweets) and now sour sweets, Randoms Sours, have joined the existing range of Rowntree’s Randoms in the UK. Seasonal selection Randoms Easter mix has also been released.

Rowntree’s Randoms were introduced ten years ago and feature jelly sweets in a variety of random shapes with six flavours: raspberry, cherry, blackcurrant, orange, lime and ice cream. The new range adds several new shapes including a hashtag, a gnome, a unicorn and a flamingo, while sweets shaped like a cake, birthday present, party popper and number ten are all added to celebrate the line’s tenth anniversary. There are more than 100 shapes in four different textures and six different flavours.

In addition to the new shapes, the green sweets, which were previously lime-flavoured, will now be apple-flavoured after the change proved more popular in testing. Nestlé said all of the sweets continue to contain no artificial colours, flavours or preservatives.

Rowntree’s assistant brand manager Hannah Smithson said: “We are so excited to announce all of this new news for Rowntree’s Randoms. There is truly something for everyone in the new range whether you prefer the jelly Squish’ems, the foamy sweets or something a little more on the sour side.

“We’ve been working very hard to make this year the best yet for Randoms and are delighted to introduce new shapes, tastes, textures and flavours that all our consumers will absolutely love.”

The new Rowntree’s Randoms launch will be supported by a media campaign, which will include advertising, social and digital media as well as sampling activity.

The introduction comes at the same time as a major rebrand for Rowntree’s, which covers Fruit Pastilles, Fruit Gums and Jelly Tots as well as Randoms.

New packaging includes brighter colours and more prominent branding, while the Rowntree’s logo itself has a more modern look with a darker green colour and updated font.

Alongside the new Rowntree’s Randoms products, Nestlé has announced it will discontinue Tooty Frooties, the chewy sweets with a hard shell that date back to the 1960s.

A Nestlé spokesperson said: “Sweet tastes and trends change over the years and Tooty Frooties have become much less popular in the decades since their launch. In 2019, people prefer the jelly and foamy sweets you find in Rowntree’s Randoms and that’s why we’ve decided to concentrate on new products under the Randoms brand.”",Nestlé releases new Rowntree’s Randoms alongside rebranding

Meanwhile, the white cheddar puffs are a crunchy corn snack baked with real cheddar cheese. Both products are gluten-free.

Kevin Moses, senior brand manager of popcorn at Conagra Brands, said: “We’re excited to continue introducing new ways for consumers to enjoy Angie’s Boomchickapop.

“With sea salt air-popped popcorn, we now offer a ready-to-eat popcorn made with avocado oil and French sea salt that contains 35 calories per popped cup that doesn’t sacrifice on flavour or real, simple ingredients.”

Conagra also introduced a microwave popcorn range under the brand last year, available in three flavours: sea salt, real butter, and lightly sweet kettle corn.

The new sea salt air-popped popcorn has a suggested retail price of $3.49 for a 4.2oz bag. White cheddars puffs is available with a suggested price of $3.49 for a 6oz bag and $5.49 for a six-pack of 1oz snack bags.

Called Brewhub, the facility is located in Córdoba, Spain, and is open to all ‘nomad’ breweries that do not have their own plant or are looking to expand yet lack the necessary facilities to do so.

It will allow the production of a variety of styles and batches, covering the entire production process, from conception to the design of packaging and labels.

Madrid-headquartered Mahou San Miguel, which makes brands such as San Miguel and Alhambra, announced the facility last year. Initially, the Brewhub will have a production capacity of 50,000 hectolitres that, through new expansion phases, will grow to 110,000 hectolitres and could eventually reach 500,000 hectolitres.

Alberto Rodríguez-Toquero, Mahou San Miguel managing director, said: “As leaders in the sector, we maintain a firm commitment with the development of pioneering initiatives that enable evolution and growth.

“The craft movement is a clear example of this transformation and we wish to boost it through a project based on innovation and collaboration. This centre stems from the calling for becoming a point of reference in the artisan brewery sector at an international level.”

Mahou San Miguel said the facility has been designed to fulfil the requirements and distinctive features of craft production. It has hired Javier Aldea, founder of Nómada Brewing, as Brewhub manager.

In December, Mahou San Miguel invested €2.1 million in a new distribution model for the south of Spain. The firm said the project ensures both the competitiveness and long-term sustainability of its sites in Córdoba, Granada, Málaga and Jaén.

The company has a total of eight breweries: eight in Spain, two in the US and one in India.

Last year, it expanded its mineral water portfolio through the acquisition of a 51.8% stake in Aguas del Valle de La Orotava, a Canary Islands-based company that bottles and sells the Fonteide and Los Alpes mineral water brands.",Mahou San Miguel inaugurates Brewhub collaborative facility

Quintessential Brands North America will take over the management and import responsibility for Quintessential’s portfolio of spirit brands, beginning from the start of May. The separate entity will serve the US, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.

It represents the company’s first independent venture outside of Europe and will be led by former Edrington and Heineken executive Steve Ward, currently vice-president business development for the US and Canada.

The changes to the US business follow the recent unveiling of Quintessential Brands’ new distillery in the heart of Dublin, which opened in February.

Quintessential Brands co-founder and executive chairman Enzo Visone said: “Since we established Quintessential Brands in 2011, we have enjoyed great success in the UK thanks to our clear dual focus on providing unrivalled innovation and quality, but as a company with global ambitions, we’ve always had great aspirations for North America when the time was right.

“We believe that time is now, so by taking ownership of our route to market in North America, we can now become the masters of our destiny in the continent.

"Plant-based products are nothing new, but the past 18 months have seen a surge in animal-free alternatives everywhere on supermarket shelves.","March 26, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Megan-K-incubator-story.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/can-plant-based-products-and-dairy-live-together-in-harmony/,"Plant-based products and substitutes are nothing new, but the past 18 months have seen a surge in animal-free alternatives everywhere on supermarket shelves. Whether this has been fuelled by health incentives and lifestyle choices, increasing awareness of animal rearing practices, or simply from consumer diets, we have to ask: is dairy on its deathbed?

It’s no surprise that the dairy industry has taken a hit in the past few years; with social media movements such as #meatfreemonday and #veganuary making the rounds promoting plant-based living, it’s hard to compete when a new generation of consumers are getting the majority of their facts via their smartphones.

Since 20-somethings to 30-somethings have a majority share of platforms on the internet, it is easy to see why it appears that dairy and other animal-based products may be losing their edge based on the opinions of an elite few. For every Instagram post that sports a purple #acaibowl with star-shaped bananas in it, there is at least one photo of a grilled animal product oozing with cheese.

In the US, a potential class suit case against Blue Diamond Growers, one of the largest producers of almond milk in North America, was dismissed by the US Court of Appeals as it was determined the labelling of their almond milk was not misleading.

It was argued that dairy alternative milk should be labelled as “imitation milk” to distinguish the difference between the products. However, the court stated that almond milk is not an “imitation” of dairy milk within the meaning of federal regulations because it is a different product.

The general consensus is that consumers won’t be misled into believing that Blue Diamond’s almond milk products are nutritionally equivalent to dairy milk based on their package labels and advertising, the court said.

According to the National Institutes of Health, vitamin B12, found in cow’s milk, is required for brain functions. In light of non-dairy milk sales increasing by nearly 30% since 2017, there is also little evidence to show that it is actually taking away market share from dairy milk as the two have different core markets.

Since it was deemed reasonable that consumers would not assume that two distinct products have the same nutritional content, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been somewhat reluctant to police the use of the term; under its standard of identity, milk is summarised as being “the lacteal secretion, practically free from colostrum, obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows”. This non-stance has been present for nearly 20 years and dairy farmers are keen to get some clarification.

The dairy industry has worked tirelessly to establish the nutritional profile of milk, so it is no surprise that they are working fervently to protect its integrity. Soy milk has the most balanced nutritional profile amongst most non-dairy milk beverages. However, a study published in 2017 by the Journal of Food Science and Technology stated that “no plant-based milk product matches the nutrients provided by cow’s milk.”

While plant-based milk sales are steadily increasing year on year, other dairy alternative products such as cheese and yoghurt haven’t quite caught the success wave. In fact, traditional dairy cheese, yoghurt and ice cream have seen a slight increase in sales, suggesting that consumers are not adhering to strict dietary rules, but are cherry picking which products they would prefer to substitute.

James Wilde, the communications and market developer for the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), says, “according to our research, veganism is growing, but from a small base and is still having little impact on overall sales of meat and dairy.”

In many homes, almond milk cartons will be placed right next to a 4L of semi-skimmed 2% milk as consumers adopt balanced ‘flexitarian’ lifestyles. Consumers are likely to have an oat milk latte in the morning whilst eating a cheeseburger for dinner. And dairy products as of April 2018 still have a 98% penetration in most UK homes.

In a recent Financial Times article, Danone, which is the world’s biggest dairy yoghurt-maker, and recently acquired plant-based American food group WhiteWave foods, downplay the rivalry between plant-based alternatives and traditional dairy.

 

 “We believe that dairy and plant-based are two complementary health-focused categories and that there are growth opportunities for both,” Danone says. “Dairy and plant-based products can serve different dietary and lifestyle preferences. More importantly, an increasing number of consumers are so-called ‘flexitarians’ who opt for both dairy and plant-based proteins, depending on what suits them best in specific occasions.”

FoodBev believes plant-based alternatives have a place in the dairy aisle and that the trend is here to stay. So this year, for the first time, we have created a category in our World Dairy Innovation Awards to recognise excellence in innovation in this growing sector: Best dairy alternative.

Sitting alongside Lion New Zealand’s brands Höpt soda and Mac’s soft drinks, Teza will join the firm’s non-alcoholic division Drinks Collective, which earlier this month announced a strategic partnership with flavoured sparking water start-up Vista.

Founded by Greenstone Drinks Company, Teza Iced Tea is made with organic leaf tea, fruit juices and botanicals. The brand offers flavours such as feijoa and lime blossom, lemon and mandarin, and peach and passionflower.

Drinks Collective general manager Stefan Gray said: “The iced tea market is in strong growth globally so we’re incredibly excited to welcome Teza Iced Teas into the Drinks Collective. The brand’s premium offering complements our existing range nicely and will help us deliver greater choice and convenience for consumers across more social occasions. We’ll be leveraging our networks to make the brand more readily available nationwide.”

He added: “I think typically people associate Lion with alcohol products and don’t realise what an amazing non-alcoholic beverage offering we have – from coffee and juices to low-sugar sodas and kombucha. We have big plans to grow the Drinks Collective as part of our commitment to meeting the evolving world of sociability and by 2025 at least 10% of Lion’s sales will come from our non-alcoholic range.”

Lion’s Drinks Collective will take full control of the Teza brand and associated assets, with the founders, Joe Gehrke and Daphne Raj, now living in Australia where they are focused on growing Greenstone Drinks Company. They will still be involved in the brand via an agreement which will see them distribute Teza for Lion in the Australian market through Greenstone.

Teza founder Joe Gehrke said: “We created Teza when we moved home from our stint in the UK. We noticed a real gap in the market for a premium, more natural iced tea offering and are proud of the growth we’ve achieved for the brand so far, including Australia, Japan, and South Korea.

“We’re thrilled to pass the Teza brand on to Lion, who has a proven track record of nurturing and growing strong brands in the Kiwi market. Under Lion, Teza can be taken to the next level.”

Called Martini Fiero, the 14.9% ABV beverage is made with a blend of white wines, Spanish oranges grown in Murcia and botanicals artemisia absinthium and artemisia pontica.

The drink’s zesty, bittersweet orange flavour has been crafted to pair specifically with tonic water. Bacardi said the simple 50/50 serve answers the growing consumer appetite for longer, more refreshing ways to enjoy vermouth as part of the aperitivo occasion.

Martini master herbalist Ivano Tonutti said: “Creating Martini Fiero was an exercise in balance. From a botanical point of view, it was essential to harmonise the vibrant citrus notes of the Murcia orange peel with the bitterness and herbal aromatics of the artemisia alongside the many other botanicals, which in turn had to sit happily alongside the quinine in tonic.”

Beppe Musso, Martini master blender, added: “We also worked hard to ensure the intense flavours of our white wine and citrus core would come through when the tonic is added. We are proud of the result – a modern vermouth with a distinctive bittersweet orange flavour that comes to life when paired with tonic. Martini Fiero is the ideal drink for the modern aperitivo.”

‘Fiero’ means ‘proud’, ‘intense’ and ‘bold’ in Italian, reflecting the flavourful character of the vermouth, Bacardi said.

With an investment of £2 million behind the brand in its first year, Marini Fiero represents the biggest new product launch Martini has undertaken in recent years.

While the majority of breakfast consumption still takes place at home, Weetabix research suggests that a quarter of consumers eat breakfast on the move. Kara and Weetabix said they have launched the new muffins “to give operators an on-the-go, quick and nutritious breakfast offer for their customers”.

Jane Olney, commercial director for foodservice at Kara, said: “It was great to partner with Weetabix to bring this muffin to the market. Consumers are increasingly eating out of home at breakfast so it’s important that breakfast choices are healthy and help keep them full until lunch time.

“Not only have we kept the saturated fat and salt to a minimum, we’ve also packed the product full of fruit and high levels of fibre to ensure multiple nutritional benefits from each muffin.”

Weetabix marketing director Francesca Davies added: “Breakfast is a dynamic occasion for consumers and businesses and while the majority of people still eat breakfast at home, we understand that lives are getting busier. Being able to grab a convenient, nutritious and tasty breakfast has never been more important.

“We are excited about the possibilities that a muffin from Weetabix will bring for consumers looking to pick up a breakfast on the move and for retailers looking to delight their shoppers with something new and relevant.”

“The launch of 100% recyclable packaging, alongside our Free Grazing Promise, further highlights our commitment to help consumers make informed purchase decisions, something we believe can add real value and differentiation to the highly commoditised cheese category.

Meanwhile, flavours accounted for 89% of the revenue growth in Coca-Cola North America’s sparkling water portfolio, which also includes Dasani Sparkling.

Lauren Freedman, smartwater brand manager, said: “Fans – especially millennials – expect Smartwater to be creative, so we knew we needed combinations that would be unique and differentiated, yet approachable,” Freedman said. “We started with more than 20 options and are extremely proud of these three delicious flavours debuting this week.”

They will be sold initially in half-litre bottles in seven US cities: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Philadelphia and San Francisco.

The company will also rollout Smartwater Alkaline and Smartwater Antioxidant throughout the US, following a limited launch last year.

“Now is the right time for Smartwater to tap into this fast-growing category,” said Shannon Richmond, group director for Smartwater. “We see an opportunity for the brand to be part of more moments and occasions throughout the day.

Thirstie’s platform allows shoppers to order alcohol from the websites of brands, while providing brands with consumer insights analytics and the ability to measure the return on investment of marketing expenditure.

It said that with today’s emphasis on e-commerce, alcohol brands are increasingly working to create direct relationships with consumers and provide them with a superior user experience.

Funds will be allocated towards its product roadmap, rolling out a new data sharing platform, and enhancements that will enable alcohol brands to offer “advanced payment methods, personalised products and customisable subscription plans”.

Thirstie also announced its integration with Drinkworks – the joint venture between Keurig Dr Pepper and Anheuser-Busch – to deliver “a seamless e-commerce experience” across its portfolio.

Visitors to the Drinkworks website can now purchase alcohol directly without needing to redirect to a third-party point of sale. This streamlined capability is said to be critical for Drinkworks, as it sells both hardware and alcohol products.

Devaraj Southworth, CEO and co-founder of Thirstie, said: “Drinkworks understands that the current dynamic of alcohol e-commerce limits them in providing the smoothest possible point of sale. The most important component of our platform is the behavioural and transactional data we are able to provide to liquor brands, which have historically been lost through selling on third-party sites.

“With these additional funds, we’ll be able to make significant new strides to help companies like Drinkworks connect the dots behind these data points to drive smarter business decisions.”

The Moscow Mule contains six-times distilled vodka and the Kentucky Mule is crafted with 100% Kentucky bourbon whiskey.

The entire Monaco line of cocktail beverages is now packaged in Ardagh 12oz Sleek cans, as Atomic Brands looks to benefit from the use of aluminium packaging.

Atomic Brands CEO Don Deubler said: “Enthusiasm for craft and artisan cocktails is an exciting consumer trend. And it’s our commitment to provide Monaco consumers with a premium on-premise, bar cocktail experience in a quality package for convenience and accessibility.

“Aluminum cans also provide the best in package integrity, enabling the retention of very specific and satisfying taste profiles.”

Claude Marbach, CEO of Ardagh Metal North America, added: “We’re very pleased to partner with Don and the Atomic team as they grow their presence in the packaged cocktail category, delivering a consistent brand and taste experience in our eye-catching Sleek cans.”

“We remain excited about the growth potential of the craft cocktail category as brands seek to extend their market reach, supported by the filling, distribution and retail display economics provided by beverage cans.”

The Monaco craft cocktail product line is currently available in 34 states, including California, Illinois, Florida and Massachusetts. Atomic Brands expects the full line to be available across the US in the next 18 months.

In January, Ardagh announced the creation of a 187ml single-serve glass wine bottle, as a response to increased consumer demand for smaller bottle sizes.

The company said single-serve wine bottles represent “a significant” new category in the wine market, allowing wineries to attract consumers by letting them sample products without committing to a multi-serve format.",Atomic Brands debuts two new Monaco cocktails in Ardagh cans
"Packaging equipment supplier Sidel has opened a new aseptic laboratory at its plant in Beijing, ten years after the factory first opened.","March 21, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/vcsPRAsset_3534731_629423_1f2dab1d-6628-4eaa-a22f-60fa9f2bda54_02.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/sidel-invests-in-new-aseptic-laboratory-at-beijing-plant/,"Packaging equipment supplier Sidel has opened a new aseptic laboratory at its plant in Beijing, ten years after the factory first opened.

The new lab will mainly be used for validation tests of Beijing-made aseptic and ultra clean equipment, and includes a testing room as well as cleaning and sterilisation facilities.

With 56 sets of advanced equipment, Sidel’s local team can run preform and cap decontamination tests, hydrogen peroxide residual tests within the packaging, plus microorganism isolation and purification. The aseptic lab also offers customers strong training support, in addition to troubleshooting potential product-related issues.

The Italian-headquartered business – part of the Tetra Laval Group – told FoodBev that demand for aseptic PET lines was likely to grow, given the rising interest in categories like liquid dairy and plant-based drinks; according to figures from Euromonitor, this market segment ranks third behind water and beer in terms of value CAGR, and second only to water for volume CAGR.

Scarlet Chen, vice-president beverages equipment sales and services for Sidel in the Greater China region, said: “With more than 1,000 installed references for sensitive products worldwide, over 40 years of aseptic expertise and nearly 100 joint complete line projects with Tetra Pak Processing Systems, local players active in the food and beverage markets can leverage our clear leadership in this segment.”

Earlier this month, Sidel announced that CEO Sam Strömerstén will retire this summer and be replaced by Monica Gimre, who is currently executive vice-president processing solutions and equipment for Tetra Pak.

The announcement was made less than five months after Sidel completed a landmark move for packaging design company PET Engineering, boosting its range of end-to-end solutions for its customers in PET packaging.

Strömerstén said: “Our Beijing site was the largest industrial investment ever made by Sidel, the only factory we have that is able to manufacture such a wide variety of packaging equipment. Nearly 4,000 installations in the country, the professional technical trainings offered in our 1,200 square meters Technical Training Centre and our continuous focus on quality, based on a LEAN manufacturing approach and driving our industrial footprint globally, are clear proofs of our commitment to the Chinese market.”

The 40,000-square-metre facility in Beijing was opened ten years ago, and this year marks the 30th anniversary of Sidel’s presence in China.

Scarlet Chen continued: “With nearly 400 Sidel complete line solutions in the region, we have extensive and rich experiences in building customer successes. Our expert team in Beijing – closely partnering with our packaging scientists based in Shanghai – ensures a 360° service to our clients during the pre-, in- and post-execution phases.

We spoke with an attorney at law specialising in biotechnology and food safety to ask how the USDA ruling will impact the US food and beverage industry.,"March 21, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/gmo-labellimg.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/how-will-the-usdas-ruling-on-gmo-labelling-affect-us-food/,"The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has ruled that GMOs in US products must be disclosed, forcing food manufacturers to be more transparent about which of their ingredients are bioengineered. This has been established in order to gain a mandatory, uniform standard of disclosure of information to US consumers about what they are purchasing.

We spoke with Stan Abramson, an Arent Fox Law Firm attorney at law specialising in biotechnology and food safety, to ask how the USDA ruling will legally and practically impact the US food and beverage industry.

What key legal points were outlined in the recent USDA ruling?

The legislation was an outgrowth of consumer interest in what information they receive when they buy food, as well as concerns on the part of the food and beverage industry from individual states.

If each developed their own labelling or disclosure requirements, we would face a localisation of labelling in the food and beverage industry. For many packaged goods or raw commodities, it would be almost impossible to deal with different disclosure standards.

When concerned members of the food industry approached congress, there was a general understanding that this was an area where action needed to be taken to prevent a calamity due to the inability to comply with requirements coming from all directions.

In terms of the legal aspects, from the beginning it was understood that congress had the authority to act in the interests of maintaining a flow of goods in interstate commerce, but also that whatever standard congress put forward had to be pre-emptive – it had to be the national standard for recovered products in order to make sure we didn’t have this disjunction between federal, state, local, and so on. That meant that the statute had to have a very specific pre-emptive clause to make sure that that would be the case.

I think that those are most likely the issues that have to be addressed in the legislation, which was then carried forward in the rulemaking proceeding.

How have GMO products changed the face of the food industry in recent years?

There have been a growing number of food and beverage products that have adopted one voluntary labelling regimen or another. The one that most consumers may be familiar with is the Non-GMO Project label. Of course, up until now, companies would have been free to put their own label on there to state that they were non-bioengineered or non-GMO. You see a lot of that in US grocery stores.

A number of surveys have also been done on the impacts on consumers. Many food and beverage companies have responded to this by altering their labelling slightly in attempts to address concerns.

Negative claims include statements such as ‘non-GMO’, ‘non-bioengineered’ and so on. There are a variety of different negative claims out there.

One thing that the rulemaking and legislation does not do is address these negative claims, and I’m sure that many companies will want to do this. The general legal requirement at state and federal levels for any labelling is that it has to be truthful and not misleading.

Any company that puts that sort of ‘negative claim’ must comply with these general legal requirements. The claim that’s provided for under the bioengineered statute and USDA’s implementing rule is by definition not misleading, but it still has to be truthful. A company that claims this has to prove that it, in fact, does not contain these bioengineered products.

The new rule makes this clear.

Does this impact the labelling more so than the ingredients themselves?

I am aware that there are some food companies who have made an effort to source from non-GMO suppliers.

You sometimes run into instances where a product, such as lettuce, an onion soup, carrots and so on, will say that it is non-GMO. This can become misleading because those sorts of products do not have biotech versions. This would make the consumer think the company has gone the extra mile in comparison with competing products. There is also the potential for consumers to be misled in thinking that other iceberg lettuces or carrots may contain GMOs.

That’s something that is going to be up to the state attorney generals, the federal trade commission and the FDA in exercising their authorities over the food label to determine whether it is misleading or not. The USDA won’t police this sort of thing except for meat, milk, and eggs.

Will this ruling impact on any imports and exports?

The rule is very clear on the fact that it will affect imports. Exports must comply with the rules of the country they are being shipped to. They may have to have a re-labelling before exporting them, but this isn’t a change brought about by the USDA’s ruling – this has been the case for a while now.

Companies must be aware of the labelling restrictions their products will face in the countries they are being exported to.

What do the changes mean for the agriculture sector?

This is a question of sourcing. There are a number of companies already doing this, but it comes down to an issue of contract law.

Each company, whether it’s a grocery store chain, processed food facility, or restaurant – for any company that is in the chain of commerce for food and beverages, it is their obligation to specify to their suppliers exactly what products are they are getting.

For example, if they are bioengineered, they must be labelled accordingly, if they are not bioengineered, then the facility should be advised of that.

Whatever it is the company wants consumers to know about their products, they need to spell those out in the contractual agreements with their suppliers so that there are no misunderstandings on the part of either party.

The facility that is receiving the commodities and the one that is supplying them must both understand what is required in terms of labelling and disclosure, and that becomes a contractual issue.

Are there any regional differences in terms of GMO foods?

I would say that Europe has a much greater interest in knowing and in some cases actually prohibiting bioengineered food products; I think that the US has seen an increase in that interest, but I don’t think that it is nearly as pervasive as it is in most of the European countries.

Why have concerns amongst US consumers been raised recently towards GMO products?

I think this is due to the growth of awareness created by a number of public interest groups.

These groups have served the cause well by striving towards this USDA requirement for individual states to disclose what is going into new products. It’s been a long-standing effort of theirs, and I think that more consumers than ever before are paying attention to such messages.",How will the USDA's ruling on GMO labelling affect US food?

Treasury Wine Estates global marketing manager Bo Jakubenko said: “We’re really excited to bring Gin Fizz to market – it’s the result of direct customer feedback about what they want to see from the Blossom Hill brand and the wine category in general. We know that gin is booming and that people are looking for refreshment and convenience from their drinks purchases.

“With Blossom Hill’s Gin Fizz we have developed a product that responds to this need. With its delicious, refreshing taste, coupled with the convenience of simply pouring it over ice, we’re confident Gin Fizz will prove successful with consumers by offering them something new and innovative from a well-established brand.”

The company – which makes brands such as St Pierre, Baker Street and Paul Hollywood – has also announced the appointment of former Tyrrells CEO David Milner, who comes on board as non-executive chairman.

The funding has been made by investment group the British Growth Fund and Lloyds Bank, and will see the company look to increase penetration in existing markets and boost new product development. Its products are currently stocked in 20,000 stores worldwide, with 60% of its distribution in the US.

Emmi has expanded its line of Caffé Latte coffee drinks with the addition of two variants: Emmi Caffé Latte Cold Brew and Emmi Caffé Latte Colombia Edition.,"March 21, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emmi-CAFFÈ-LATTE-Cold-Brew-230ml-EU1.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/emmi-adds-cold-brew-and-colombian-varieties-to-caffe-latte-range/,"Emmi has expanded its line of Caffé Latte coffee drinks with the addition of two new variants.

Caffé Latte Colombia Edition combines intense arabica coffee from Colombia with Emmi’s Swiss milk. The new variant replaces the outgoing Mexico Edition and has an “intensive coffee aroma thanks to a roasting process which is perfectly matched to the high-quality beans”, Emmi said.

Meanwhile, new Caffé Latte Cold Brew is somewhat milder, brewed with cold water for twelve hours for less acidity. At the same time, coffee brewed in this way requires the addition of less sugar, the dairy company pointed out.

Both drinks will be available in the Caffé Latte range’s distinctive 230ml cups.

“During the scorching summer of 2018, demand for Emmi Caffè Latte literally exploded,” a company spokesperson said. “Both in Switzerland and internationally, Emmi achieved growth in the low double-digit percentage range, with gains recorded in all countries where the chilled coffee beverage is sold.

“Of course, the successful concept of Emmi Caffè Latte is not founded on an unusually hot summer. Since the product was first launched in 2004, our chilled white coffee drinks have seen growth every year thanks in particular to their unrivalled taste. The secret of our success is not really a secret: high-quality coffee, which is brewed straight after roasting and teamed with fresh Swiss milk. Unsurprisingly, market research conducted in the UK showed that seven out of every ten consumers prefer Emmi Caffè Latte to competitors’ products.

“To ensure that the “fairy-tale” summer of 2018 continues, Emmi is investing a great deal in the further development of Emmi Caffè Latte, with our primary focus on coffee expertise.”

Both new varieties are available now in Swiss retail outlets; Emmi said that the cold-brew version would remain exclusive to Switzerland for the time being, while Caffè Latte Colombia Edition will be exported to Germany, Austria, Belgium and Spain.

The Lucerne-based business has built a steady trade on its RTD coffees, seeing group sales rise by 2.8% to CHF 3.46 billion ($3.47 billion) for 2018 – with chairman Konrad Graber and CEO Urs Riedener citing the “good performance” of its Caffé Latte coffee drinks as a contributing factor.

Awareness of how supply chains impact the overall product was a prevalent theme at this year’s show, and Morimoto explained how Tcho is working with key members of their supply chain to create a self-sustaining way of producing high-quality chocolate.

“Most people don’t even realise that the vast majority of cacao farmers haven’t even tasted chocolate, and that’s problematic when you’re trying to create a high-end chocolate product.

“So we’ve tried to solve that problem by going down to each region that we source our cacao from – Peru, Ecuador, Dominican Republic, Ghana and Madagascar – and built what we call ‘Flavor Labs’, which are small laboratories with everything you need to make small batches of your own chocolate.

“We then train all of our farmer partners on how to make chocolate, but more importantly, we teach them how to taste it. What does it taste like when it’s not fermented properly, or it’s not dried properly? We can help them change their processes to maintain a high consistency but also quality throughout their part of our supply chain.”",Interview: Tcho on how cacao education can impact on quality

If finalised, the new regulations would amend the allowable levels of fluoride added to bottled water to 0.7 milligrams per litre.

The proposed rule would not affect the allowable levels for fluoride in bottled water to which fluoride is not added by the manufacturer but which may contain fluoride from its source water.

The FDA said the proposal is based on findings from research on optimal concentrations of fluoride that balances its benefits in preventing tooth decay with its risk of causing dental fluorosis, a condition most often characterised by white patches on teeth.

If adopted, the rule will align with the recommended level of 0.7 milligrams per litre set forth by the US Public Health Service (PHS) for community water in 2015. At that time, the FDA also advised the bottled water industry that the PHS recommendations should be considered for their products as well.

Susan Mayne, director of FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said: “Fluoride provides an important public health benefit by helping to reduce cavities and tooth decay. But too much fluoride over a long time when teeth are forming under the gums can cause changes in the appearance of tooth enamel, called dental fluorosis. Striking the right balance is especially important for children under the age of eight as their permanent teeth are still forming.

“It’s the FDA’s responsibility to ensure that if fluoride is added to bottled water, it is added at appropriate levels so that consumers receive its important health benefit while also being protected from potential adverse effects. That’s why today we are taking this step to lower the amount of fluoride in bottled water if added by manufacturers.”

She added: “Most fluoride added to bottled water is already at or below the limit being proposed. Today’s action, if finalised, is a step toward helping to ensure that bottled water strikes the right fluoride balance by setting out requirements that manufacturers who add fluoride to bottled water must adhere to.”

The proposed rule provides a 60-day period for the public, industry and other stakeholders to share comments with the FDA.",FDA proposes updated rules for fluoride added to bottled water

Founded in 2001, Leeb Biomilch obtains its milk from around 100 Austrian organic farmers and produces a range of yogurt, milk and cheese products.

Supplying customers throughout Europe, the company generates annual sales of approximately €15 million, just under half of which comes from Austria.

Other key markets include Germany and the Netherlands, where it collaborates with Emmi subsidiaries AVH Dairy and Bettinehoeve, among others.

In 2016, the company created the MyLove-MyLife of vegan milk alternatives, featuring products made from almonds, coconut and oats.

Leeb Biomilch owners Hubert Leeb and Jörg Hackenbuchner will retain the remaining 34% stake in the company and continue in their current roles as managing directors. No changes to staff are planned in other areas.

Hackenbuchner said: “Together, we have managed to develop organic sheep’s and goat’s milk products from very little to an attractive niche range that enjoys strong demand throughout Europe.”

Urs Riedener, Emmi Group CEO, added: “Leeb Biomilch GmbH is not only a good fit for Emmi based on its goat’s milk products, but also on its clear commitment to quality, innovation and sustainability.”

Emmi entered the goat’s milk products business in 2010 through its acquisition of Californian company Cypress Grove and Swiss brand Le Petit Chevrier. Positive experience in the segment has prompted it to strengthen its position in what it describes as an “attractive niche”.

Emmi’s goat’s milk network now includes two processors in the US (Cypress Grove and Redwood Hill), two in the Netherlands (Bettinehoeve and Goat Milk Powder), one in Spain (Lácteos Caprinos) and AVH Dairy, a global trading company also based in the Netherlands.

With immediate effect, Döhler will manage Zucasa’s juice production facility located in the Huesca region of Spain through its subsidiary Döhler Fraga.

Zucasa began production in 2010 with three lines for processing fruits and vegetables: two of which are for purées and one for juices. Currently, it employs around 50 people on permanent contracts, reaching 150 workers during high season.

Döhler said the deal marks a “great step forward” in one of Europe’s largest fruit production areas, adding that its customers will benefit from a more diverse offering in the stone fruits segment as well as in apples and pears.

In a statement, Döhler said: “Zucasa’s extensive expertise and ability to provide fruit and vegetable juices, purées and concentrates for food and beverages, combined with the broad product portfolio and the comprehensive industry knowledge of the Döhler Group, will create unique synergy effects.”

Headquartered in Darmstadt, Germany, Döhler is active in more than 130 countries and has more than 40 production sites globally.

Last October, the company acquired a majority stake in Italian firm Nutrafood, in a move to boost its plant-based food and beverage offer.

Speaking with FoodBev at SIAL Paris, Döhler product manager for fruit and vegetable ingredients Julian Bopp revealed how the company has created a fruit and vegetable juice concept that blends orange and zucchini juice.

"Nestlé has announced its biggest move into the meat alternative market, unveiling plans to launch plant-based burgers in Europe and the US.","April 03, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Garden-Gourmet.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/nestle-to-launch-plant-based-burgers-in-europe-and-the-us/,"Nestlé has announced its biggest move yet into the meat alternative market, launching a new plant-based burger in Europe and unveiling plans for a similar product in the US.

Released under the Garden Gourmet brand, the Incredible Burger will launch in Europe from April, first coming to Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.

Featuring natural protein from soy and wheat, the product is 100% plant-based. Natural plant extracts – beetroot, carrot, and bell pepper – help create the look of a beef burger before, during, and after cooking, Nestlé said.

Wayne England, head of Nestlé’s food business, said: “These new burgers don’t compromise on flavour, texture and cooking experience. They underline Nestlé’s increased focus on tasty, authentic plant-based food. We believe this trend is here to stay, as consumers look at different ways to enjoy and balance their protein intake and lower the environmental footprint of their diets.”

As of this autumn, Nestlé will also roll out a plant-based burger in the US under the Sweet Earth brand, customised for the American consumer. Called the Awesome Burger, the product aims to complement Sweet Earth’s existing veggie-centric burgers. Nestlé USA acquired California-based Sweet Earth in 2017.

Nestlé said both new products are the result of a collaboration between culinary chefs, alternative protein researchers and food experts at both Garden Gourmet and Sweet Earth.

Wayne England added: “We’re proud of our ability to make healthy and sustainable food accessible to everyone through our trusted brands. This includes plant-based food products under our Garden Gourmet range in Europe and the Sweet Earth brand in the US.”

The announcement comes as consumers increasingly look to cut back on their meat and dairy consumption, due in part to ethical and health concerns. According to a study by research firm IGD last year, 52% of British grocery shoppers say they either follow or are interested in following a plant-based diet, with 68% of 18 to 24 year olds claiming to follow a vegan, vegetarian or flexitarian diet.

Earlier this year, Impossible Foods released a new meat-free burger, containing no gluten, animal hormones or antibiotics.

The 32% ABV beverage features a base of Bacardi Superior white rum, which is then infused with natural lime flavours to provide “an intense flavour with aromas of lime zest and natural bright citrus notes”.

Bermuda-headquartered Bacardi said lime was the obvious choice for the new flavour as it is the most popular fruit to be paired with rum.

Roberto Ramirez Laverde, vice president, Bacardi for North America, said: “As soon as the weather warms up, people are ready to take their drinks outside, whether it is for an outdoor barbecue, party on the beach or happy hour on a rooftop bar – Bacardi lime is the perfect complement to these spring and summertime occasions.

“We have watched the flavour space grow year after year and we know that consumers are going to embrace this new infused rum, especially when they’re on the hunt for a refreshing new cocktail.”

Starting this month, Bacardi Lime will be available for a suggested retail price of $12.99 (750ml).

The rum joins eight other flavours under the Bacardi rum range in the US: banana, limón, raspberry, grapefruit, coconut, pineapple, mango, and dragonberry.

Last month, Bacardi Spiced was introduced in the UK as a response to the increasing global demand for flavoured rums. The 35% ABV spirit is made with gold rum mellowed in American oak for a “hint of smokiness” and blended with natural flavours and spices to create a “bold, yet smooth taste”.

Made using 100% pork salami and 100% mild cheddar, the Peperami and Cheese Snack Box is said to be high in protein.

In a statement, Jack Link’s said: “Not only is Peperami and Cheese Snack Box convenience at its finest, but it’s the ultimate alternative to a sugary treat. With its real ingredients, you know you’re getting a powerful protein kick instead of a sugar slump.

“They’re a match made in heaven for lunchboxes, or if you just want something to keep the kids quiet with while you’re trying to read their maths homework.”

In 2014, Unilever offloaded its meat snacks business – including the Peperami and BiFi brands – to US company Jack Link’s.

At the time of the deal, Jack Link’s CEO Troy Link said: “Jack Link’s’ mission is to be the number one provider of branded meat snacks throughout the world. This acquisition is a significant step in delivering on that mission.”

Last October, Jack Link’s announced the release of three high-protein snack products in 2019: Smokehouse Beef Sausages, Steak Bites, and Cold Crafted Linkwich.

The company also added new packaging for its beef jerky in the UK, which aims to educate consumers about the range. The beef jerky line is available in three flavours: original, sweet and hot, and teriyaki.",Jack Link's introduces Peperami and Cheese Snack Box in the UK
"Bubs Australia will acquire Australia Deloraine Dairy, a Melbourne-based infant formula producer that meets regulatory import conditions into China.","April 02, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kristy-carr2.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/bubs-australia-targets-growth-in-china-with-deloraine-dairy-deal/,"Bubs Australia has secured a deal to acquire Australia Deloraine Dairy, a Melbourne-based infant formula producer that meets regulatory import conditions into China.

The consideration includes AUD 25 million ($17.8 million) in cash and AUD 10 million ($7.1 million) in Bubs shares. If certain performance targets are met, further payments of up to AUD 15 million ($10.7 million) will be paid to Deloraine over the next three years.

Bubs first entered a manufacturing agreement with Deloraine in June 2018 to produce Bubs goat milk infant formula and CapriLac goat milk powder products. Its Melbourne facility has the capacity to process 10 million tins of formula with its existing production line and could double capacity with capital expenditure in the future if required.

Kristy Carr, Bubs Australia founder and CEO, said the deal “represents an important step” in the firm’s vision to expand in China.

“Importantly, the acquisition will have a significant positive impact on our business through a material reduction in our production costs, as well as placing Bubs in the best possible position to achieve SAMR (State Administration for Market Regulation) brand registration to enable the company to export their infant formula products to China to be sold in physical mother and baby stores.”

She added: “We believe this is a win-win all round – for Bubs and Deloraine’s customers, suppliers, relationship partners and employees alike. In the meantime, we don’t intend to change any material aspect of the Deloraine business or the customers it already serves. Deloraine’s principal and general manager will continue the day-to-day management of the business as a full-time employee of Bubs.”

The announcement comes a month after Bubs said it will form a joint venture with dairy company Beingmate to sell its portfolio of infant formula and baby food products in China. Under the proposed venture, Bubs will supply its products to Beingmate’s distribution network, which covers 30,000 stores throughout China.

Bubs has also revealed it has entered into an agreement for a private share placement with private equity firm C2 Capital Partners, which will raise approximately AUD 31.4 million ($21.3 million). Funds from the capital raising will be used, in part, for the Deloraine acquisition.

C2 will ultimately hold a 15% stake in Bubs and the firm’s managing partner Steve Lin will join the Bubs board as a non-executive director.

“We have been very impressed with the important milestones that Bubs has achieved in Australia and China,” said Lin. “We see great potential in China for Bubs, an authentic Australian brand that is building on a sophisticated vertically integrated supply chain and high-quality and trustworthy infant nutrition product portfolio. We are pleased to partner in its financial underpinning and look forward to contributing impactful strategic value.”",Bubs Australia targets growth in China with Deloraine Dairy deal

The site currently has four furnaces to produce and supply approximately 300,000 tons of glass containers annually for Grupo Modelo brands such as Corona, Modelo Especial and Pacífico.

O-I expects the business to contribute approximately $140 million of revenue and $40 million EBITDA on an annual basis. The glass manufacturer will also enter into a long-term agreement to continue to supply glass to Grupo Modelo.

These, along with the investment in the Nueva Fanal glass plant, are examples of the near-term strategic growth opportunities we discussed at our November 2018 investor day and incorporated into our 2019 outlook.”

The Gironcourt plant expansion was announced last month and will see O-I invest more than $60 million as it responds to growing consumer demand for sustainable glass packaging. It is expected the project will be completed in early 2020.

The companies have started developing NFC-enabled OpenSense closures so that brands can protect their products and assure customers that the contents of the bottle are authentic and safe to consume.

The OpenSense solution detects when a closure seal has been broken and alerts the consumer that the container or bottle may have been tampered with.

Tapì and Thinfilm plan to release a suite of integrated smart closures to the premium segment of the spirits market over the coming months, addressing a broad range of spirits closure styles and design, aesthetic, and protection requirements.

A second closure type, based on the Thinfilm SpeedTap tag, is designed to allow brands to open a direct channel to customers for delivering real-time experiences throughout the consumer journey.

We are excited to offer cutting-edge IoT technology in the beverage sector, which will protect and enhance our customers’ products on several fronts.

"At Hannover Messe 2019, Tetra Pak will debut its new 'factory of the future' concept and announce an energy assessment programme in partnership with ABB.","April 01, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/johan-nilsson-warehouse.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/tetra-pak-debuts-factory-of-the-future-partners-abb-on-energy/,"This week at Hannover Messe 2019, Tetra Pak will unveil its “factory of the future”, where digital technology revolutionises the way food manufacturing plants operate.

Machines will be able to communicate with each other as well as with the digital systems of the entire operation, automatically taking on tasks such as diagnosing problems, ordering and delivering parts, and looking for an engineer who is most suitable for the service needed. The technology builds on previous measures to bring the benefits of digitalisation to the food and beverage industry, such as the launch of Tetra Pak Plant Secure and condition monitoring.

Supported by these smart solutions, the workforce will be able to focus on managing the plant, making quick, informed decisions and continuously increasing the speed of production, reducing errors and minimising product waste.

Johan Nilsson, vice-president for industry 4.0 and digitalisation at Tetra Pak, said: “We are in a period where the market is changing at high speed. Consumer demands coupled with regulations require a new way of food manufacturing that is much more efficient and food safety guaranteed.

“At the same time, we believe humans should continue to be at the centre of the management of food manufacturing, with digital solutions as their support.”

Tetra Pak has been working on the digitalisation of food manufacturing with partners including Microsoft, ABB, SAP and the automated logistics solutions provider Elettric80. Combining these cutting-edge technologies with the company’s food expertise, Tetra Pak’s ultimate goal is to lead the digital transformation of food manufacturing and offer greater support to its customers in the digital era.

Tetra Pak has also today announced it is developing an energy assessment programme in collaboration with ABB to help food and beverage producers lower their environmental impact and cut costs. These solutions are being showcased in the Swedish Pavilion at Hannover Messe 2019.

The programme provides an assessment of the entire plant, helping customers minimise their environmental impact and maximise profitability. Based on this analysis, Tetra Pak provides recommendations for food producers on opportunities to reduce energy consumption and help them make informed decisions about how resources are used in their plants.

Based on pilot projects in the Americas, the programme can potentially reduce carbon emissions for food and beverage manufacturing and cut energy cost by between 15% and 25%.

The strategic collaboration will combine the strengths of ABB Ability digital solutions and Tetra Pak’s unique expertise in food manufacturing – and will build on both companies’ global installed base, deep domain and digital transformation expertise.

Nilsson continued: “There is a sense of urgency for all industries to reduce their environmental impact across their operations, and we are developing programmes together with our partners to reduce this impact for our customers and the overall industry. The plant assessment programme is an excellent example of an area where we have found and created opportunities for environmental savings.”

And Visar Krasniqi, group vice-president for digital transformation at ABB, added: “With this strategic collaboration, Tetra Pak and ABB will create and drive a leading manufacturing ecosystem to provide Tetra Pak’s customers with the most advanced digital solutions and services. Additionally, this will enable Tetra Pak’s customers to run ABB’s digital solutions and their operations with improved overall efficiency, flexibility and sustainability.”

German milk processor Deutsches Milchkontor (DMK) will acquire baby food brands Alete and Milasan as it continues to invest in the baby food market.,"April 01, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kategorie-getraenke2.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/germanys-dmk-announces-deal-for-baby-food-producer-alete/,"German milk processor Deutsches Milchkontor (DMK) has announced a deal to acquire baby food producer Alete – part of what it calls a “continued restructuring” that has seen the business protect itself against falling consumption of dairy.

The acquisition, which has already completed, will see DMK inherit Alete’s flagship brand of baby food – as well as the contract manufacturer German Babyfood, which operates a baby food factory in Bavaria and owns the Milasan brand of baby food products.

DMK said that “dairy concern continues to restructure its product range”, suggesting that other non-dairy acquisitions might be in the pipeline. The company’s baby food business is strategically important to DMK; it already has brands including Humana and Milram, and in February opened a high-tech baby food facility in Strückhausen, northern Germany for its Humana brand following investment of approximately €145 million.

With its latest acquisition, DMK is “opening up additional segments” as part of its baby food strategy, the company said.

Stefan Eckert, COO of DMK’s baby food business, explained: “We expect there to be more profitable growth for the baby food market in the coming years. With the acquisition of Alete and Milasan, we are making a sensible addition to our product range whilst also significantly expanding our sales and distribution radius.

“Alete is a well-regarded and traditional baby food brand in Germany. It enjoys a high level of consumer confidence, especially in the traditional complementary baby food sector, which is a highly dynamic and attractive sector with sustained growth rates. Together with our baby milk brand Humana, we will be able to offer parents two brands with an age-specific range in future.”

DMK is not acquiring the “production element”, but said that the range of baby food made by Alete and Milasan would continue to be produced at an existing plant in Bavaria. Around 25 employees working in sales and administration at a site in Bad Homburg will move forward under the DMK Group.",Germany's DMK announces deal for baby food producer Alete

Kellogg announced in November 2018 that is was exploring the sale of its cookies and fruit snacks businesses so it could focus on its core operations.

The proposed sale comprises a significant portion of Kellogg’s North American snacks business, and includes the entirety of Kellogg’s North American cookies unit, which is composed of brands including Keebler, Mother’s, Famous Amos and cookies manufactured for the Girl Scouts of the USA.

According to Kellogg, the combined operations of the businesses included in the transaction recorded net sales of nearly $900 million and operating profits of approximately $75 million in 2018.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approval, and it is expected to be completed by the end of July 2019.

Production facilities located in US cities including Augusta, Georgia; Florence, Kentucky; Louisville, Kentucky; Allyn, Washington; and Chicago, Illinois are also included as part of the deal.

This agreement does not affect the rest of Kellogg’s North American snacks business, which includes brands selling products such as crackers, salty snacks and toaster pastries.

Steve Cahillane, Kellogg’s chairman and CEO, said: “This divestiture is yet another action we have taken to reshape and focus our portfolio, which will lead to reduced complexity, more targeted investment, and better growth.

“Divesting these great brands wasn’t an easy decision, but we are pleased that they are transitioning to an outstanding company with a portfolio in which they will receive the focus and resources to grow.

“On behalf of our entire company, I want to thank the many employees who support these businesses and have contributed to the strength of these brands.

“We appreciate their passion, commitment and everything they have done for Kellogg. These talented individuals are going to a first-class organisation in Ferrero, where they undoubtedly will thrive.”

Mahou San Miguel and another one of its US-based craft beer partners, Founders Brewing Company, have together purchased a 40% stake in Avery for an undisclosed figure. Mahou San Miguel previously owned a 30% stake in Avery, so the latest purchase gives Mahou and Founders a 70% stake in the brewer.

Mahou also owns a 30% stake in Founders Brewing Company, which was ranked by craft beer trade group the Brewers Association as one of the largest beer companies in the US.

According to Mahou, the US is one of its key target markets, and the purchase will allow both Mahou and Avery to grow their brands and help stimulate the growth of the craft beer segment.

To achieve this, Mahou says it will invest in Avery’s marketing and commercial development to boost the profile of its craft beer range, which includes beers such as White Rascal, Real Peel IPA and Liliko’i Kepolo.

This purchase forms part of a concerted effort by Mahou to expand its presence in the craft beer segment. This strategy saw the company invest €11 million to build a BrewHub in Córdoba, Spain, earlier this week, which serves as a collaborative space for craft breweries to share ideas and develop their beers.

Alberto Rodríguez-Toquero, general director of Mahou San Miguel, said: “This agreement reinforces our business in the United States, a market that is leading the craft revolution and that fits perfectly with our capacity for innovation and passion for beer culture.

“For us, it is another step that brings us closer to realising our vision of becoming a benchmark in the craft and premium segment nationally and internationally.”

Founders Brewing co-founder and CEO Mike Stevens added: “Avery Brewing is one of the pioneer artisans of the Western United States and the Avery have been our friends and confidants for several decades.

“Our industry needs people who want to focus on the legacy and creation of multigenerational breweries Avery Brewing’s dedication to quality speaks volumes about what all of us, as craft brewers, have built over the years.

Brands included in the transaction include Clos du Bois, Black Box, Estancia, Mark West, Wild Horse, Franciscan, and Ravenswood.

Meanwhile, included wineries are Mission Bell, Turner Road Vintners, Clos du Bois and Wild Horse in California, Hogue Cellars in Washington, and Canandaigua in New York.

Bill Newlands, Constellation Brands CEO, said: “One of the hallmarks of our success over the years has been our ability to evolve and stay on the forefront of emerging consumer trends. This decision will help enhance organisational focus on a more premium set of wine and spirits brands that better position our company to drive accelerated growth and shareholder value.

“In turn, Gallo is acquiring a collection of great brands that complement their operational model and business strategy to provide quality products to consumers at every price point.”

Joseph Gallo, chief executive officer of Gallo, added: “We are committed to remaining a family-owned company focused on growing the wine industry. While we continue to invest in our premium and luxury businesses, we see a tremendous opportunity with this acquisition to bring new consumers into the wine category. We will continue to provide our customers and consumers with quality products at every price point.”

In its most recent quarterly results, Constellation recorded a 9.5% rise in net sales, as its Corona and Modelo brands continued to drive growth. However, sales growth in the company’s wine and spirits segment was stagnant, up 0.4%

The firm predicted that for fiscal 2019 it expects net sales and operating income in its wine and spirits unit to decline low-single digits.

Following the divestiture, Constellation said its remaining wine and spirits portfolio represents a collection of “powerhouse brands”, including Svedka Vodka, Casa Noble Tequila, High West Whiskey, Mount Veeder Winery and The Prisoner Wine Company.

Abrahams explained how the brand’s new lighter, carbonated range of protein waters are marketed towards the convenience space of beverages.

This new product uses collagen as a protein source as opposed to traditional whey.

“Collagen is one of the body’s biggest building blocks – for hair, skin, nails and so on. It has a protein benefit of restoring muscles, but also there’s a benefit for the whole body in general through using collagen,” Abrahams said.

Collagen Boosters are another new product released by the brand, which target consumers who want to maintain healthy skin.

“These can be taken over breakfast or whenever you’d like to take it at your convenience.”

Abrahams also noted the flavour combinations of lotus flower and jasmine, which adhere to the trend of botanical-inspired beverages.",Protein Water Co: 'Collagen is a very exciting area for us'
"Emmi has launched a new range of yogurts with high-cream content in Switzerland, as it aims to offer consumers a more indulgent yogurt option.","April 04, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Emmi-Moments.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/emmi-releases-moments-yogurt-range-with-high-cream-content/,"Emmi has launched a new range of yogurts with high-cream content in Switzerland, as it aims to offer consumers a more indulgent yogurt option.

The Emmi Moments range is available in four flavours: chocolate, caramel, strawberry and lemon cheesecake.

The main difference between Emmi Moments and most other yogurts is the high cream content. Instead of 2.5% to 3%, the fat content in the milk used in products is 7.5%.

While recognising that consumers increasingly watch what they eat and make deliberate decisions on their diet, Emmi said these decisions can go in very different directions.

For some, it means severely restricting calories; for others, it’s more about finding the right balance and incorporating the widest range of foods possible. For the latter, indulgence has its rightful place in a balanced diet, Emmi said. The flavours have between 130 and 148 calories per 100g.

Last month, Emmi expanded its line of Caffé Latte coffee drinks with the addition of two new variants: Colombia Edition and Cold Brew. The dairy also released a new cave-aged gouda under its Kaltbach portfolio of cheeses earlier in the year.

Earlier this week, the Swiss company acquired a 66% stake in Austrian milk processor Leeb Biomilch, in a move to expand its goat’s and sheep’s milk offer.

A new report from food and drink consultancy Zenith Global has found that the value of the UK water cooler market has reached £140m...,"April 03, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Water-1.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/value-of-the-uk-water-cooler-market-rises-to-140m-report/,"A new report from food and drink consultancy Zenith Global has found that the UK water cooler market has experienced its sixth consecutive year of growth, as in 2018, the value of the market reached £140 million, a rise of 4.9% when compared with 2017’s £133 million figure.

The UK’s total installed cooler base grew 2.2% to 678,000 units, and the growth of the market over the course of the year was driven by both POU (mains fed) and bottled water cooler (BWC) unit placements.

POU outstripped growth the growth of BWC units for the second consecutive year in 2018, up 3% to a total of 323,000 units, though the BWC market did grow at a faster rate than in 2017, rising 1.5% to 355,000 units.

Zenith’s report claimed that the hot summer weather in the UK – the hottest late spring and summer in the country since 1929 – was one of the major contributing factors to the growth of the market, while the continuing interest in calorie-free hydration was another contributing factor.

This growth is projected to continue in the years to 2023, and Zenith Global chairman and founder Richard Hall said: “The UK water cooler market is set to continue growing by close to 2% a year. We forecast 742,000 units will be in operation by 2023, with bottled water throughput per cooler reaching 980 litres. Mains coolers are likely to gain further share towards 50% of the total”.

The figures were revealed at the British Water Cooler Association (BWCA) Conference and Trade Show 2019, and Jon Wicks, BWCA chairman, said: “I am proud of the continued growth and success that our sector continues to deliver. This is in some measure due to high professional standards maintained by the work of the British Water Cooler Association.”

Phillipa Atkinson-Clow, general manager of the BWCA, added: “We are pleased to see this continuing growth for the sector. However, the uncertainty around Brexit – which we had expected to be nearing a resolution by the time of this conference – may undermine confidence, and for all of us, the level of economic prosperity is impossible to judge at present.

“The sugar tax which was introduced last year – and announced on the day of the BWCA conference in 2018 – has enabled the BWCA and businesses to underline their positive health credentials.

“In addition, cooler companies have been able to take advantage of the increasing move away from single-use plastics as people recognise the sustainability benefits of coolers, which either use mains water or containers that are reused up to 50 times before being recycled.”

The Lincolnshire factory, which employs 450 people, produces Scotch eggs, cocktail sausages and a range of seasonal products.

Tulip said the project will allow Ruskington to create a smaller specialist factory on-site to bring niche products to store quickly and efficiently.

It will also provide greater capacity for higher-volume lines, better equipping the site to meet the demands for further growth in the snacking category. Overseeing the investment will be newly appointed site director Ian Bagnall.

Tulip operating director Shaun Kay said: “We’re really pleased to announce this investment at our world-leading Ruskington site. This will future-proof the site and help us lead the way on innovation alongside our retail partners.

“This investment will support the continued growth we have seen in our core product lines thanks to a resurgence in popularity of non-pastry traditional snacks such as Scotch eggs and savoury bites. We are also investing in a dedicated facility and state-of-the-art equipment to support the development of a range of niche products, which can be more complex to produce.”

Andrew Cracknell, who was appointed Tulip CEO last year, added: “We have recognised how eating habits have changed, including a growth in food to go and high-protein snacking. Investment in our Ruskington site shows how we are driving growth in the snacking category, offering products containing a variety of protein, flavours and dips to appeal to younger consumers, whilst also future-proofing more traditional snacking options. At the same time, this enhanced capability and capacity will ensure outstanding service delivery and quality levels for our customers.

“This significant investment in our Ruskington facility underlines our ongoing commitment to the Lincolnshire region and demonstrates continued inward investment into the UK by our parent company Danish Crown. We’re confident that the site will be well-placed to help drive our business forward in the years ahead.”

In January, Tulip joined forces with British pork snacks brand Snaffling Pig to release a range of gammon steaks. The products are created at Tulip’s Westerleigh site, which has been expanded in recent years to enhance gammon production capabilities.",Tulip invests £2.3m in UK site to bring new innovations to market

Featuring 24 layers of pastry, a cherry remonce filling, flaked almonds, the brand’s signature glaze, and hand-finished with white icing, the new addition aims to add value to the Danish pastry category in the UK.

Inspired by Lantmännen Unibake UK’s maple pecan plait, the new pastry features the “much-loved flavours of a cherry bakewell in an innovative new format”, the company said.

Kate Sykes, marketing manager at Lantmännen Unibake UK, said: “Traditional British flavours are experiencing a significant resurgence. It is therefore imperative that brands work with their customers to explore ways to bring these flavours to life across new formats and consumption occasions.

“We know that when it comes to Danish pastries, almost half of consumers (48%) seek out traditional flavours. Acting on this insight, we’ve developed our new cherry bakewell plait to deliver a taste that consumers know and love, in a format that’s a little bit different.

“We are constantly innovating and looking at ways to keep the category fresh and we are confident that our latest addition will be an instant hit, encouraging more consumers into the Danish pastry market.”

Last year, Lantmännen Unibake UK announced a £4.4 million investment into its Milton Keynes factory, as a response to growth in the burger market.

In March, the business’s parent company, Lantmännen, secured a deal to acquire Tate & Lyle’s oat ingredient business, which is based in Kimstad, Sweden, enabling it to meet growing demand from customers in the Nordic food industry.

During the 12 months to 28 February, net sales stood at $8.12 billion. Operating income was up 6% to $2.41 billion.

Net sales of Constellation’s beer brands – which also include Funky Buddha, Four Corners and Ballast Point – were up 11.6% for the year.

During a conference call, CEO Bill Newlands highlighted the performance of Modelo Especial, which he described as “the leading growth engine in the entire US beer market”.

He said: “Modelo Especial is now the number-one brand in three markets and the entire state of California and the number-two brand in five additional major markets, growing double-digits in 41 of the 50 states.”

During the year, Corona brand family shipments volume reached 150 million cases while the Modelo brand family crossed the 125 million case mark.

Meanwhile, wine and spirits net sales were down 0.2% to $2.91 billion and operating income from the unit shrank 2.9%.

The results were published a day after Constellation announced a deal to offload around 30 of its wine and spirits brands and six US winemaking facilities to E & J Gallo Winery for $1.7 billion.

The transaction – which includes brands such as Clos du Bois, Black Box, Estancia, and Mark West – sees Constellation sell wines principally priced at $11 or less in retail stores, as it looks to focus on its premium beverage portfolio.

Newlands, who took over as CEO last month from Rob Sands, added: “We’ve positioned our wine and spirits business for success with our announced plans to sell a portion of the business, which enables us to continue to strategically focus on our powerhouse, high-margin, high-growth brands.

“During fiscal 2019, our beer business delivered industry-leading double-digit sales and operating income growth led by our powerful, high-end brands and successful consumer-led innovation. Overall, we’re confident in our ability to drive top-line growth of mid-to-high single digits over the next three to five years across our entire business.”

During the upcoming fiscal year, the company expects net sales and operating income in its beer segment to grow between 7% and 9%.

On the lookout for new ways to increase its sustainability credentials, Ölgerðin decided to update its packaging material to a new format that has less of an impact on the environment.

And with consumers in Iceland increasingly demanding smaller portions and more eco-friendly options, Ölgerðin has used Ball’s 33cl format, which features a high-definition printing technique.

Available in berry and citrus variants, the Ava range is made with just Icelandic sparkling water and fruit.

Ölgerðin brand manager Jóhannes Páll Sigurðarson said: “As activists for sustainability, we are constantly looking for ways to improve our footprint, and refreshing our packaging was the natural next step to achieve this.

“By working together with Ball, we’ve not only been able to tick this box with the introduction of a sustainable new 33cl can format, we’ve also gained access to its experts’ valuable insight and guidance into how best to create our design on a can.”

Christian Nilsson, sales manager Nordics, Ball, added: “We really appreciate working together with beverage companies like Ölgerðin who want to embrace their sustainability credentials and truly make a difference to the environment.

FoodBev discusses with Ronja Berthold and Minna Hakaoja about how companies should navigate concerns about sodium levels in plant-based meat alternatives.,"April 05, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/plant-based-burger.jpg,https://www.foodbev.com/news/meat-free-alternatives-is-sodium-a-concern-for-companies/,"This week saw Nestlé’s biggest move into the plant-based space so far. With the news of this, it became pertinent to ask: as consumers become more educated about health and wellness, should companies be concerned with the levels of sodium in their plant-based meat alternatives?

To explore this further, FoodBev’s Harriet Jachec spoke with Ronja Berthold, the political outreach officer for the European Vegetarian Union (EVU) and ProVeg International, and Minna Hakaoja, food industry and retail consultant for ProVeg International.

Berthold stressed that sweeping health claims can occur when discussing meat-free alternatives, as the vegan and vegetarian market is so vast.

“The market comes with so many different plant bases, compositions, and flavourings. So there is a huge variety within the space.

“When it comes to salt, some vegan and vegetarian alternatives do contain large amounts of salt. There was a study conducted in Germany that compared vegan and vegetarian alternatives to their animal based counterparts where they found that large amounts of salt are in the meat-based originals to begin with.

“What they also found was that plant-based foods are nutritionally and physiologically more favourable than the non-vegetarian ones especially when it comes to protein and fat content.”

Consumers are not only reaching for plant-based alternatives for health reasons, but for sustainability concerns too, Berthold noted. This could negate some concerns surrounding sodium in favour of purchasing environmentally- and animal-friendly food products.

“Consumers who purchase meat-free alternatives are also looking out for the environment and animal welfare, for example. So there are many reasons as to why consumers are purchasing these products, and health is just a singular reason.”",Meat-free alternatives: is sodium a concern for companies?

Verrerie Calvet will be integrated into Berlin’s Bruni Glass division and will be run in partnership with the Bruni Glass team in France, which has offices and warehouses at Nice.

Following the deal, which is expected to close in the coming weeks, Verrerie Calvet employees will remain with the business.

Paolo Recrosio, managing director of Bruni Glass, said: “Joining with Verrerie Calvet strengthens our enterprise in France and across Europe. The team is talented, and the product and service offerings are excellent. Our operations in France have grown at double-digit rates every year, and now I expect even better things for our future together.”

Berlin Packaging CEO Andrew Berlin said: “Berlin Packaging has enjoyed tremendous growth in North America and Europe.

Three flavours are available in the UK: Kettle and apple slices with Norfolk pork sausage seasoning, Kettle and sweet potato slices with smoked chipotle and crème fraîche seasoning, and Kettle and beetroot slices with goat’s cheese and caramelised onion seasoning.

Kettle said the flavours, which have been created by its chef Phil Hovey, transport consumers “to the flavours and textures of a complete meal in every bite”.

Available in Sainsbury’s and Tesco stores from April, the 100g sharing bags will retail for £2.25.

Last September, Kettle released a new line of Ridge Cut crisps in the UK, inspired by flavours from around the world. The range is available in sharing packs in three variants: Chinese spare ribs, barbecue beef brisket, and jalapeño Jack.

Kettle said the crisps are made by freshly slicing whole potatoes rather than reforming the potato, which is said to carve out extra surface area for seasoning “for a big taste impact”.

Kettle Foods, the manufacturer of Kettle Chips snacks, last June invested £2.7 million to upgrade the manufacturing capabilities of its Norwich factory.

The Kettle Chips brand was acquired by Campbell Soup in 2017 as part of its $4.87 billion deal for Snyder’s-Lance.

BWCA chairman Jon Wicks and general manager Phillipa Atkinson-Clow spoke with FoodBev about the latest developments affecting the cooler industry...,"April 05, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Jon-and-Phillipa-still-final.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/hot-summer-and-increased-water-demand-propels-cooler-growth/,"British Water Cooler Association (BWCA) chairman Jon Wicks and general manager Phillipa Atkinson-Clow spoke with FoodBev ‘s Martin White about the latest developments affecting the cooler industry at the annual BWCA Conference & Trade Show.

Wicks told FoodBev that the key theme of the Conference – Insight to Change, Learn, Unlearn and Relearn – aimed to help inform businesses whether they needed to change their operations in preparation for Brexit, and how the industry can ensure that it maintains its reputation for sustainability when climate change is one of the main issues for consumers.

Wicks also informed FoodBev that last summer’s hot weather helped to drive the growth of the market, as did the increasing numbers of employers providing facilities which dispense water as healthy hydration is playing a more important role in modern day offices, while the increased global awareness of the importance of drinking water and staying hydrated also played a key role.

“Firstly, as we all know we had a fantastic summer last year, and when people are hot they tend to consume more water, so that was quite a large driver for the market. Secondly, in terms of employers providing facilities which provide cool water, I think the agenda is moving up to look after their employees (in this way).”

At the time of publication, the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is still on the table, and we asked Wicks what a no deal exit could mean for the UK’s water cooler industry.

“From an industry perspective, a no-deal Brexit will have an impact on employment and bringing people into the country, and obviously when it’s growing, the industry is going to require more employees. Secondly, we have an exchange rate issue. We don’t know where that is going to go, so potentially the equipment we buy in could become more expensive, which will drive prices up to our customers going forward.

“But if we just take the industry as a whole, because we’re very UK-focused, I don’t think we’re really going to see a big impact beyond pricing and labour. We’re very lucky in that regard.”

In 2017, the BWCA launched its 5 for 5 Sustainability Pledge, which aimed to ensure that members addressed five core aspects of their business over a five year period: Environmental sustainability, water management, social sustainability, financial sustainability and providing a supportive workplace.

When asked what the association could do over the next year to further promote sustainability, Atkinson-Clow said: “I think that Lord Deben mentioned that ther was a lot more that the industry could do to shout about our good credentials.

“I think as an association, we already have that, especially through our 5 for 5 programme. What I think members really need to do now is to shout about it themselves within their own marketing programmes.",Hot summer and increased water demand propels cooler growth

Located in the Mariendorf neighbourhood, the facility contains a 100hl brewhouse, a 10hl pilot brewing system as well as a taproom and beer garden.

The site will be closed for between six to eight weeks for refurbishment, with BrewDog moving in on 1 May.

San Diego-based Stone Brewing initially worked with BrewDog for a collaborative beer at the Scottish brewer’s original site in Fraserburgh, Scotland. In 2015, BrewDog agreed to a deal to import Stone Brewing beers into the UK. As part of the Berlin agreement, the site will continue to brew Stone Brewing beers.

Greg Koch, co-founder and executive chairman of Stone Brewing, said: “Ultimately our project in Berlin turned out to be a bit too aggressively big and bold, and a little too far from home, for Stone to continue to operate. It’s also a much shorter flight from Scotland to Berlin than it is from San Diego. By a lot.

“We wish our friends at Brewdog every success with the Mariendorf gasworks property. We loved it and brought it to life, and we know they’ll do the same in their own way. They will do great things. And from time to time, as we’ve done in the past, we’ll do some of those great things together.”

BrewDog co-founder James Watt added: “We are really excited to become a small part of the craft beer movement in Germany and the German beer scene overall and we are also really excited to be part of the Mariendorf community.

“Beer, people and community have always been the foundations of our business and that is what we will be focusing on in Berlin too as we look to share our passion for craft beer with as many people as we can.”

BrewDog has also launched the Berlin Craft Collective, which will see the company open up the new brewery to the independent craft brewers of Berlin, providing them full access to its 10hl pilot system. “We want to make our new Berlin brewery the hub for the craft beer movement and use it to help elevate the status of beer and craft brewing in Germany,” Watt said.

Founded in Scotland 2007, BrewDog launched its Equity for Punks crowdfunding initiative in 2010, which saw the company raise £67 million over five rounds. It now has 80 bars globally and exports to 60 countries.",BrewDog acquires Berlin brewery from US-based Stone Brewing

The owner of Jameson whiskey and Absolut vodka has launched its 2030 Sustainability & Responsibility roadmap, which sets out a range of targets supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

By 2030, the firm aims to reduce the overall intensity of its carbon footprint by 50% in line with the Science-Based Targets initiative.

Responding to climate change challenges, Pernod Ricard will also develop regenerative agriculture pilot projects within its own vineyards in eight wine regions: Argentina, California, Cognac, Champagne, Spain, Australia, New Zealand and China. It will then partner with more than 5,000 farmers to share this knowledge further.

In addition to eight main commitments, the company has formed plans to embed a UN Human Rights approach across its value chain, address waste water and move towards fully renewable electricity.

Vanessa Wright, Pernod Ricard VP sustainability and responsibility, said: “We know that our customers have now come to expect our brands to be responsible and respectful of the environment – values that have been at the very heart of our business since its inception.

“These 2030 commitments provide us with a focused framework across our business in helping to address some of the biggest sustainability issues, so consumers can enjoy our products in a convivial and sustainable way.”

Alexandre Ricard, Pernod Ricard CEO, added: “We are 19,000 ‘créateurs de convivialité’ – passionate hosts but also respectful guests on our planet. Sharing our values, respecting our terroirs and promoting responsible consumption are all conditions for sustainable growth. Yesterday, today and tomorrow, we will continue to create for the long term”.

In the last eight years, Pernod Ricard has reduced its water consumption per litre of alcohol by 20% and its carbon emissions by 30% per unit of production. Last year, the company pledged to eliminate the use of plastic straws and stirrers.

In its most recent quarterly results, Pernod Ricard recorded a 3% rise in quarterly net sales to €2.79 billion, as it was boosted by a strong performance in Asia.",Pernod Ricard plans transition to sustainable packaging by 2025

"As consumers call for increased food traceability, urban agriculture company Gotham Greens aims to capitalise through its range of greenhouse-grown produce.","April 08, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Viraj-Puri.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/urban-farming-gotham-greens-sees-continued-rise-in-demand/,"Following the recent romaine lettuce E coli outbreak across North America, US authorities called on the leafy greens supply chain to adopt emerging technologies to trace produce from field to fork.

From October to December, a total of 63 people were infected with the same strain of E coli. While no one died, 25 people were hospitalised and two developed kidney failure.

Following the romaine recall, prices of other lettuce varieties more than doubled at one point due to surging demand. The outbreak – which saw authorities warn consumers to avoid eating romaine lettuce – has heightened consumer demands for traceability, as they aim to ensure the food they purchase is safe to eat.

US urban agriculture pioneer Gotham Greens believes the scare, and resulting supply chain and traceability issues, served to validate its business model of growing produce in a secure environment that can reduce the risk of food-borne pathogens. Indeed, during the incident, the company saw a surge in orders of its romaine lettuce.

“Customers were confident in the origin of Gotham Greens produce and they knew they could rely on our products to be safe and grown locally in sterile greenhouses,” said CEO Viraj Puri, who co-founded the company in 2009.

The firm opened its first facility in 2011, located in Brooklyn, New York, and it now operates more than 180,000 square feet of greenhouse across four sites in New York and Chicago – and currently has an additional 500,000 square feet of development underway across five US states.

Last June, the company secured $29 million in a funding round, as it aims to continue transforming urban real estate and promoting sustainable agriculture.

Supplying retail, restaurant, and institutional customers, Gotham Greens’ non-GMO, pesticide-free produce is grown using sustainable methods in climate-controlled urban greenhouses using 100% renewable electricity.

The firm sells produce such as iceberg lettuce, basil, baby kale, rocket, a range of leaf blends, as well as a selection of salad dressings and dips.

“When we built our first rooftop greenhouse, there was really no precedent for what we were trying to construct and we faced our fair share of scepticism from landlords,” Puri said. “Over the last ten years, urban farming has become commonplace in cities across the country, utilising space that wouldn’t traditionally be used for agriculture such as former industrial sites, rooftops, backyards, and parking lots.”

“Over the last decade, we’ve seen a major shift in consumer preferences towards local and sustainably produced food products. The rise in recent foodborne illness has underscored the need for greater traceability and transparency in the supply chain. As a result, we’ve seen a continued rise in demand for greenhouse-grown produce. There is an incredible value proposition of growing highly perishable fresh food in close proximity to large population centres while using fewer natural resources.”

Last week, Gotham Greens revealed plans for a new $12.5 million site in Providence, Rhode Island, which is expected to open its doors in early autumn 2019, creating 60 jobs. Geographically, New England is farthest from the West Coast, where the majority of leafy greens distributed across the US are currently grown.

Using growing methods such as recirculating hydroponics, data-driven climate control intelligence, and renewable energy, the facility is expected to produce approximately “30 times the yield of conventional agriculture per acre”.

The company’s technology enables it to capture irrigation water for re-use, which allows it to use “90% less water” than conventional farming, while eliminating all agricultural runoff. The greenhouses let it to grow year-round in regions that typically have much shorter growing seasons.

While it serves large foodservice operators and retailers such as Whole Foods Market and Target, Gotham strives to be community-minded and collaborates with local businesses, schools, and community partners where its facilities are situated.

“By locating our greenhouse farms in cities, Gotham Greens not only eliminates the environmental footprint and food waste linked to shipping produce long distances but also advocates for improved healthy food access, environmental education, and community development,” Puri said.

“We want to bring farming closer to city residents while simultaneously addressing supply chain issues for the food industry at large. We think globally but act locally.”

With seven years of data and experience to help inform growing decisions at future sites, the Gotham team believe they are ready to expand their project in 2019, with plans in place to more than double the workforce.

With the food traceability market predicted to surge in the coming years, the future looks positive for Gotham as it meets consumer demands for more sustainable, locally grown produce. Puri concluded: “The challenge is of course that the larger and more successful we get, the more complex scaling the business becomes.”",Urban farming: Gotham Greens sees ‘continued rise’ in demand

With an ABV of 4.5% and 120 calories per can, three flavours are available in the US: hard strawberry lemonade, blackberry mojito, and margarita.

The range is created with six ingredients: carbonated water, alcohol from cane sugar, cane sugar, lemon and/or lime juice concentrate, natural flavours, and fruit juice.

MillerCoors announced plans last August for the Cape Line range, which has been developed for consumers looking for lower-calorie versions of their favourite drinks.

“Today, people want it all – they want simple and natural ingredients, and flavour without compromise,” said Sofia Colucci, vice president of innovation at MillerCoors. “With 75% fewer calories than a classic margarita and the same bold flavour of cocktails, Cape Line represents the best of both worlds.”

She added: “The beverage landscape is evolving quickly and MillerCoors is committed to offering people what they want. Cape Line hits on a variety of consumer demands – bold taste that does not compromise on being a healthier option.”

Cape Line sparkling cocktails are packaged in 12oz slim cans, featuring a design to show off their cocktail-inspired contents. The drinks are sold in 6-pack and 12-pack variety packs, and a standalone hard strawberry lemonade 6-pack.

The range will be supported by a national marketing campaign focused on the brand’s theme ‘Welcome to Cape Line’.",MillerCoors introduces sparkling cocktails under Cape Line brand

The resources will be used to strengthening operations and market execution in the firm’s beverages business, as well as in its food and snacks division.

Speaking before the annual shareholders meeting, Arca Continental chairman Manuel Barragan Morales said: “Consistent with Arca Continental’s long-term vision, in 2019 we will continue to reinforce and expand our production, distribution, and customer service capabilities in the markets we serve in order to strengthen our position and capture new opportunities for organic and inorganic growth.”

In 2018, Arca Continental’s net sales were up 14% year-on-year to $8.33 billion, while EBITDA rose 5.7% to $1.44 billion.

“In 2019, we will focus our efforts on innovation and on fine-tuning our diverse commercial initiatives,” said CEO Arturo Gutierrez Hernandez. “We will also reinforce operations in the US and in all our territories through greater digitisation projects and a more profound analysis of the information we collect from the market.”

Last September, Arca Continental subsidiary Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages (CCSWB) started work on the $250 million distribution and production facility in Houston. The site, which is expected to open in the first quarter of 2020, will be the first dedicated Coca-Cola bottling plant constructed in the US in a decade.

The plant will feature five production lines, in-line blow moulding, distribution facilities, a warehouse and a sales department.

Shloer Spritzed is a sparkling soft drink developed as an alternative to gin and tonic as well as aperitifs. Available in three variants – bitter orange, grapefruit and mint, and bitter lemon and lime – the range is packaged in 700ml glass bottles with a recommended retail price (RRP) of £2.49.

Meanwhile, Shloer Pressed draws inspiration from flavoured ciders and is available in three variants – strawberry and lime, rhubarb and apple, and mixed berries – in 330ml cans (RRP £1) and 4 x 330ml multipacks (RRP £3.50).

The beverages join Shloer Original, billed as an alternative to table wine, and Shloer Bubbly, which provides a non-alcoholic option to sparkling wine.

The Shloer brand is targeted at women aged between 28 and 49. SHS Group, which also owns the Bottlegreen and WKD brands, said that trends for alcohol moderation and healthy lifestyles mean that the adult soft drink category “is more relevant to this consumer group than ever before”.

Nick White, head of soft drinks at SHS Drinks, said: “The launches of Spritzed and Pressed mark a watershed for Shloer: these are the biggest developments that the brand has ever undertaken and herald a new dawn.

“Shloer is all about sharing – be that sharing a drink or sharing the good times; our new ranges take that thought and expand it into additional alcohol alternative situations.

“Our strategic review of Shloer and the expanded role that the brand can play going forwards resulted in insight-led NPD that is all about new audiences, exploring trends, leveraging the brand, and leading the ASD (adult soft drink) category from the front. Our intention is to make Shloer the drink of choice for those who want to have fun and join in, even when they are not drinking alcohol.”

Shloer will benefit from “significant marketing support” in 2019, including an advertising campaign spanning both digital and traditional media.

The site will more than double Greenleaf Foods’ production capacity to meet “surging consumer demand” for its portfolio of brands, including Field Roast and Lightlife Foods, which Maple Leaf bought in 2017 for $120 million and $140 million respectively.

At approximately 230,000 square feet, the facility will service customers across North America and construction is expected to start in late spring 2019, with production start-up expected in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Maple Leaf said the site supports future expansion with multiple phases of investment expected over the next decade to meet forecasted market growth. The company will employ approximately 460 people at the new facility.

Last October, Maple Leaf announced the formation of its Greenleaf Foods subsidiary to head its plant-based businesses.

According to the company, plant-based protein represents a $1 billion North American market. High growth rates are expected to continue as consumers look to cut back on meat intake.

Michael McCain, Maple Leaf CEO, said: “This investment will secure our ongoing leadership in this rapidly expanding market. By establishing a large-scale North American network, we will continue to meet rapidly growing demand for delicious protein alternatives and create a centre of excellence for innovation. It will escalate the financial contribution of this business and advance Maple Leaf’s vision to be the most sustainable protein company on earth.”

Field Roast’s portfolio includes plant-based sausages, roasts, loaves and deli slices. In January, Maple Leaf launched a line of pea protein-based meat alternatives, including a new plant-based burger, under the Lightlife portfolio, as part of a redesign to mark the brand’s 40thanniversary.

The range consists of a plant-based burger, bratwurst sausage, Italian sausage and an alternative to ground meat. Maple Leaf said the range “offers the taste, texture, aroma and appearance of traditional meat”.

Headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario, Maple Leaf revealed plans last November to build a CAD 660 million ($497.7 million) facility in London, Ontario, which it said will be “one of the most technologically advanced poultry processing plants in the world”.",Maple Leaf to build $310m plant-based protein facility in Indiana

FoodBev Media’s Harriet Jachec spoke with two founders of alternative snacking brands to discover more about new snacking trends.,"April 09, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chickpeas-1.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/alternative-snacking-consumers-are-striving-to-be-more-mindful/,"Healthy snacking has been capitalised on by many new companies, and alternative snacking is now an established option. This is an indication that consumers can move away from established ways of snacking.

‘Popped’ and ‘baked’ snacks, in particular, are just some of the alternatives that have become popular. Lotus seeds and chickpeas can be used as the main base ingredients for these products – which also nod to their regional influences.

FoodBev Media’s Harriet Jachec spoke with two founders of alternative snacking brands. Akhil Kumar is the founder of Guruji, which are popped lotus seeds, and Poorvi Patodia is the founder and CEO of Biena Snacks, which offers a range of baked chickpea puffs.

Alternative snacks are often attributed names which link to their origins. ‘Gurujis’, for example, are spiritual leaders from India, Kumar says.

“I grew up eating the seeds and knowing about their notable health credentials, and they were also the perfect replacement to snacking on nuts due to my allergies.

“Another nod to my and the product’s Indian heritage is the ‘Gyan Mudra’, the hand on the front of the pack which is a symbol of physical and mental wellbeing. Not only do we want people to eat a great tasting snack, we want them to feel healthier.”

This link to health goes beyond branding – lotus seeds can often bring the benefit of incorporating clean label ingredients into their formulations.

“Consumers are striving to be more mindful snackers and increasingly make more ‘considered’ purchases,” Kumar continued.

“There is a drive towards natural, free-from, clean label products, however, taste is still the most important attribute to consumers when it comes to snacking. Popped lotus seeds tick all of these boxes.”

Patodia concurs, noting how health-conscious millennial consumers may reach for alternative snacks: “There’s a growing momentum in the snacking industry overall to answer consumer demand for healthier snack options. Snack-hungry millennials are buying products like chickpea snacks because they generally prefer clean, simple ingredients.

“Chickpeas are also naturally gluten-free, low in sugar, and high in protein and fiber, which helps keep you fuller, longer.”

Lotus seeds and chickpeas are also good plant-based alternatives for consumers who seek a way to incorporate protein into their diets when staying away from dairy- or animal-based protein products.

“Consumer interest in protein-rich diets and clean eating is growing. People are getting smart about snacking,” Patodia added.

The attraction to alternative snacks such as lotus seeds and chickpeas also comes from the sustainability movement. Consumers such as flexitarians and vegans may seek alternative snacking options not only for diet-related purposes, but to also practice environmentally-friendly diet habits.

Kumar noted: “Lotus seeds are also sustainable which is an increasingly important factor for today’s consumer. Our seeds are hand-farmed; no machinery is used in the process of making their puff texture meaning the product is not extruded. In addition, they are grown using natural water supplies.

“Extrusion is a manufacturing process that ensures the uniformity of puff snacks. It isn’t necessarily a bad thing but it’s a manufacturing process nonetheless.

“’Non-extruded’ could eventually become a category of its own, just like ‘extruded’, ‘free from’ or ‘dairy free’ are today, but this would certainly take some time.

“Moving away from manufacturing processes like extrusion reflects consumer behaviours and demand.”",Alternative snacking: 'consumers are striving to be more mindful'

The agreement with Luzhou Laojiao International Development, which is described as “a major force” in the global duty free retail market, will see output rise from 600,000 litres to 1 million litres a year.

Luzhou Laojiao will also distribute the distillery’s Spey and Beinn Dubh brands in China, where sales of Scotch whisky continue to surge.

Owners Speyside Distillers said the deal will place the company’s spirits portfolio in duty free outlets across China, the US and other markets.

John McDonough, chief executive officer of Speyside Distillers, said: “Although our brands have been present in China for a number of years, most of the distribution and sales activity has been within the southern provinces.

“This distribution agreement with Luzhou Laojiao will enable us to move to a completely different level and will help to meet the growing demand for single malt Scotch whisky from China’s urbanised, affluent young professionals.

“We anticipate that the supply demand for global duty free and duty paid within China will have a significant impact on production, which we forecast will rise by around 66% from our current 600,000 litres of spirit a year to 1 million litres.”

Staff from Luzhou Laojiao signed the distribution agreement while on a visit to Speyside Distillery, which is based close to the town of Kingussie.

Its range comprises five core single malt expressions, which are complemented with limited-edition bottlings from historic warehouse stock. The distillery added Beinn Dubh ruby black whisky to its collection in 2015 and, more recently, the Byron’s Gin range.

Managing director Patricia Dillon said: “Our international reach has grown significantly in the past five years and our brands are now present in 34 different countries.

“Due to John’s existing business operations in Taiwan when he bought the distillery, we were very quickly able to cultivate a market for Spey in that territory and it has historically always been a key driver for sales.

“Around 70% of our global sales currently come from that region, but this agreement with Luzhou Laojiao for global duty free and internally within China sets us on a path that will challenge the volume that we have in Taiwan.

“China is a market that we have watched very diligently for a number of years, but we needed the support of a major partner before we could contemplate making the significant inroads that we now anticipate.”",Speyside Distillery boosts output following China distribution deal

Eurazeo Brands, joining existing investors including First Beverage Ventures, said it will provide the company with “proven brand-building, operating, and category expertise”.

Founded in 2007, Q Mixers makes beverages such as ginger beer, tonic water, and ginger ale.

Jordan Silbert, CEO and founder of Q Mixers, said: “Over the past 12 years, we have built an incredible community that shares a fundamental vision: your mixer should be as great as your spirit. Together with Eurazeo Brands, we will build this company into the mixer brand of choice.”

Ben Karlin, president and co-founder of Q Mixers, said: “The US premium mixer market has reached an inflection point. Our growth is rapid and accelerating – but we are in the early stages of disrupting a category long dominated by brands that don’t resonate with today’s discerning drinkers.

“Premium penetration in mixers substantially lags spirits, and we expect high growth in the years ahead. We look forward to working with Eurazeo Brands and tapping into their expertise to scale our business and establish category leadership globally.”

As part of Eurazeo Brands’ investment, Jim Goldman, senior advisor to Eurazeo, and George Birman, a member of the Eurazeo Brands investment team, will join the Q Mixers board of directors.

Johan Clarin, CEO of Orkla Food Ingredients, said: “The acquisition of Zeelandia Sweden AB is strategically right for strengthening Orkla’s position and production capabilities in our Nordic home markets in categories with which Orkla Food Ingredients is very familiar. Their product portfolio makes a good fit with the Credin Group.”

In January, Orkla secured a deal to buy a 90% stake in Easyfood, a Danish producer of bread-based convenience products. Founded in 2000, Easyfood had a turnover of DKK 316.1 million ($48.7 million) in the 12 months to the end of October 2018 and employs 144 people.

"At the BWCA Conference 2019, FoodBev spoke with Crystal IS about the company's range of UV disinfection solutions for water dispensers and coolers...","April 10, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Crystal-IS-interview-BWCA.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/crystal-is-discusses-its-uv-disinfection-solutions-for-water-dispensers/,"At the BWCA Conference & Trade Show 2019, FoodBev Media spoke with Crystal IS product manager James Peterson about the company’s range of UV disinfection solutions for water dispensers and coolers.

Crystal IS’s Klaran brand produces several UV disinfection solutions for water dispensers such as the Klaran AKR reactor, a compact solution which is able to eradicate contaminants in water such as e.coli, legionella and pseudomonas.

Peterson explained how the company’s UVC LEDs make water safe to drink, and explained the core benefits of UV disinfection solutions when used in water dispensers, namely their long lifetime, compact nature and the fact that they do not need regular maintenance.

“Klaran UVC LEDs provide an output of ultraviolet light and that is at the peak of DNA absorption, so this causes an inactivation in microorganisms that makes the water more hygienic when served.

“Traditional solutions like mercury lamps now use wavelengths such as 254 nanometres, that’s still quite effective, yet the benefit we get with LEDs is being able to more precisely target an organism’s DNA.”

When asked whether interest in UV solutions has increased in the recent past Peterson said: “Right now, Crystal IS sees the need for disinfection rising across the world at the moment. We’re seeing factors such as degrading infrastructure, and increases in bacterial contamination are starting to build up consumer demand for UV.

“Companies that distribute coolers are looking for solutions that can provide this feature in a more effective way than traditional solutions.”

Peterson also claimed that the reduced need for consistent maintenance is one of the core benefits of Klaran’s UV solutions: “With UV lamp solutions or microbial filtration methods, frequently what you’ll run into are scenarios where these solutions have very short lifetimes or can end up failing unpredictably.

“The issue there is that when a cooler or dispenser is operated and when a failure occurs, a technician needs to reach it and fix the issue. So the difference we’re providing with UVC LEDs relates to not only extending the lifetime of treatment, but also providing higher reliability and avoiding unplanned service.”",Crystal IS discusses its UV disinfection solutions

Fairlife produces a range of ultra-filtered milk products, and the brand claims that its filtration process removes lactose and sugars from milk while retaining the milk’s natural vitamins, protein and calcium content.

The new 300,000 square-foot plant will enable Fairlife to increase production of products across its entire portfolio, including the different varieties of Fairlife ultra-filtered milk, Core Power, Fairlife YUP! and more.

Fairlife anticipates that the new plant will be operational by the end of 2020, and the company has partnered with the United Dairymen of Arizona (UDA) to ensure that the milk used at the facility is sourced from local farmers.

Tim Doelman, chief operating officer of Fairlife, said: “I’m extremely proud that the demand for our milk has grown so much that we now need another manufacturing site!

“In choosing a new plant location, it is essential that the new facility be built in an area where dairy farms are willing and able to follow Fairlife’s responsible animal care and sustainable farming practices while producing the highest quality milk.

“Not only are there amazing dairy farmers in and around Goodyear, its location enables competitive domestic and international production.”

Fairlife was formed in 2012 as a joint venture between Coca-Cola and the Select Milk Producers dairy co-operative. Coca-Cola now operates as the official distributor of Fairlife products.

“The bold, colourful look reflects our playful, fun nature but also drives home the messaging that Primula is made with real cheese and real added ingredients.

“It was also really important for us to highlight that we’re proudly made in Britain. Our colleagues in Gateshead in the northeast work tirelessly round the clock to deliver millions of tubes to supermarkets across the UK and Ireland to ensure everyone gets their Primula fix.”

A five-week Primula advertising campaign has started on ITV to demonstrate the cheese’s many uses.

The squeezy cheese range includes flavours such as cheese ‘n’ chives, cheese ‘n’ ham, cheese ‘n’ prawns, and cheese ‘n’ smoked salmon. They are on sale with a recommended retail price of £1.45.

"Craft Brew Alliance, through its pH Experiment business unit, has announced the launch of a new line of low-alcohol, low-calorie seltzers.","April 11, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Craft-Brew-Alliance.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/craft-brew-alliance-to-introduce-low-alcohol-seltzer-range-in-july/,"Craft Brew Alliance (CBA), through its pH Experiment business unit, has announced the launch of a new line of low-alcohol, low-calorie seltzers.

Called Pacer Low Proof Seltzer, the range will be available in the US as of July in three flavours: blood orange, meyer lemon and lavender, and melon and mint. With an ABV of 2%, each beverage is gluten-free and contains fewer than 50 calories.

The beverages are the latest innovation to come from CBA’s pH Experiment, which was launched last year and is focused on creating, incubating and accelerating new products that put drinkers’ needs first.

pH Experiment general manager Karmen Olson said: “We already knew moderation was becoming more important to drinkers. What we understood more fully after last year’s research was that moderation means different things to different people in different occasions.

“We heard from many drinkers who said they wanted something that would help them pace themselves to stay in control. With seltzers growing triple digits but available only in non-alcohol or 5% ABV, we saw an opportunity to create a low-proof offering that would allow drinkers to moderate at their own pace.”

Pacer will be available in two pack sizes: a variety 12-pack and a blood orange six-pack.

Last month, pH Experiment released Pre Aperitivo Spritz, which is described as “a distinctively dry botanical bubbly inspired by the classic Italian cocktail”.

Formed in 2008, CBA is headquartered in Portland, Oregon, and owns Kona Brewing Company. In 2018, the company acquired three US beer firms: North Carolina’s Appalachian Mountain Brewery, Massachusetts’ Cisco Brewers, and Florida’s Wynwood Brewing Co.",Craft Brew Alliance to introduce low-alcohol seltzer range in July

“This innovation is a prime example of how we’re making more possible with milk. It’s a great-tasting protein beverage delivering the energy people crave.”

The beverages are now available in Arizona, with a nationwide launch planned this summer.

Arizona-based Shamrock Farms sells a range of dairy products such as milk, sour cream, cottage cheese, and whipped cream.

Last year, the company released new packaging for its Rockin’ Protein range, in a move to more prominently display a commitment to purity and freshness.

Selected Nestlé scientists, students and start-ups will be able to use dedicated ‘hot desks’ at the Nestlé R&D Accelerator, and will be given access to Nestlé’s R&D expertise and infrastructure, including shared labs, kitchens, bench-scale and pilot-scale equipment.

Nestlé estimates that the unit will be operational by the end of 2019, and the first research teams already have been selected by the company.

The Nestlé R&D Accelerator is based in Lausanne, Switzerland, and forms part of Nestlé’s global R&D network. The accelerator is located at the same facility as the company’s dedicated research unit Nestlé Research, which was founded last year.

Stefan Palzer, CTO of Nestlé S.A. said: “We have taken a number of steps to accelerate innovation, including our enhanced prototyping capabilities and the funding of fast-track projects.

With the Nestlé R&D Accelerator and its proximity to our R&D and business teams, we will bring open innovation to a new level.

Combining our internal expertise and the deep knowledge of our academic and industrial partners with external entrepreneurial creativity is a unique approach and will create an innovation powerhouse.

“It will accelerate the translation of innovative ideas and concepts into tangible prototypes and products.”

A number of high-profile food and beverage companies such as Coca-Cola, Campbell’s and Mars have launched accelerator programmes over the last year, as companies aim to keep pace with changing consumer trends and habits.

The launch of the Nestlé Research unit last year aimed to address changing consumer habits by finding ways to further enhance the nutritional profiles of its products, following calls from senior figures for the company to increase its focus on health and nutrition.

In a further boost to its research operations, Nestlé inaugurated a new R&D facility in Shenzhen, China last month, which will create new food and beverage products for consumers in Asia, and will also investigate new system technologies relevant for Nestlé’s global beverage businesses.",Nestlé launches R&D accelerator to boost product innovation
"Dutch food company Wessanen has announced its board has accepted a takeover offer led by PAI Partners, which values the firm at around €885m.","April 11, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/kallobmccc1220.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/wessanen-agrees-to-be-acquired-by-consortium-for-885m-euros/,"Dutch food company Wessanen has announced its board has accepted a takeover offer valuing the firm at around €885 million.

The Amsterdam-headquartered company – owner of brands such as Kallø, Whole Earth, and Clipper Teas – will be bought by a consortium consisting of private equity firm PAI Partners and Charles Jobson, Wessanen’s largest shareholder.

Following completion of the deal, PAI will hold approximately 62% and Charles Jobson approximately 38% in the consortium.

In a statement, Wessanen said it welcomes the prospect of the longer term stability under the ownership of the consortium, expanding its position in organic foods.

The consortium said it shares Wessanen’s view to upgrade its operations to improve the efficiency across the entire value chain of the business and to add scale in core categories and markets through acquisitions.

The transaction will not have a direct impact on the total workforce and the Wessanen headquarters will remain in Amsterdam.

Christophe Barnouin, CEO of Wessanen, said: “Our vision is to build a European leader in organic and sustainable food. We want to remain at the forefront of making food healthier and more sustainable for the benefit of both consumers and the planet. This requires a long-term commitment from shareholders and long-term investments. It is all the more critical in an era where organic, sustainable and healthy themes have grown increasingly popular, which in turn has resulted in a more competitive landscape.

“PAI and Charles Jobson are fully supportive of our strategy and will bring a longer term horizon and additional investments supporting the execution of our plans. We believe that for our existing shareholders, the offer represents an attractive price. Taking into account the interests of all stakeholders, the boards consider the offer to be in the best interest of Wessanen and we therefore fully support and recommend the offer.”

Gaëlle d’Engremont, partner at PAI Partners, added: “Wessanen is extremely well-positioned in the European health food industry, housing high-quality brands and being at the forefront on innovation in this rapidly growing sector. We intend to accelerate Wessanen’s growth using our experience in the food and consumer space and investing further in the brands and the people of Wessanen to increase the reach of the company.

“We are fully committed to Wessanen’s current strategy and are excited to work alongside their passionate management team and long-time shareholder Charles Jobson. Together we can support the company to further build on its position as a leading sustainable and healthy food company in Europe, fully engaged with its customers on a daily basis.”",Wessanen agrees to be acquired by consortium for 885m euros
Müller Milk & Ingredients has announced it could cut up to 40% of its 835 fresh milk and cream SKUs in the UK as part of a major cost-cutting drive.,"April 11, 2019",https://www.foodbev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Muller.jpg?x21220,https://www.foodbev.com/news/muller-milk-ingredients-eyes-milk-and-cream-sku-reduction/,"Müller Milk & Ingredients (MMI) has announced it could cut up to 40% of its 835 fresh milk and cream SKUs in the UK as part of a major cost-cutting drive.

Labelled the ‘SKU rationalisation programme’, the move forms part of Project Darwin, which was announced by the business in February and aims to save £100 million.

The Darwin initiative includes a comprehensive review of every aspect of MMI’s operations – including logistics, back office and people organisation – in order to simplify the business and reduce costs.

By working collaboratively with customers to focus on popular SKUs, MMI said it will improve its environmental performance, supporting its long-term sustainability.

The project will allow the business to remove 400 tonnes of plastic from its core fresh milk SKUs, while reducing distribution costs.

Patrick Müller, CEO of Müller Milk & Ingredients, said: “At a typical dairy, more than 90% of the milk we buy from farms is manufactured into less than 80 different product formats, meeting customer requirements for different milk types, pack sizes and labelling formats.

“At the same dairy, the remaining 10% of milk would be processed into a further 125 SKU formats, which is staggering. Typically, this milk will be packed into smaller or unusual formats, which tend to be far less efficient not only in terms of manufacturing but through the whole supply chain.

“The environmental cost of persisting with some of these less common SKU’s is significant, requiring our dairies to halt production whilst pack formats are changed for very small production runs, causing unacceptably high levels of product waste, energy use and complexity throughout our business.

“We are working closely with our customers who are fully aligned with the need to simplify and improve environmental and business performance and we are extremely encouraged by the response we’ve had.

“Fresh milk is a loved, iconic British tradition and it’s in 96% of the nation’s fridges. With Project Darwin, we have an opportunity to reinvigorate the industry and we will do so by challenging established practices that have become the norm, benefiting the whole supply chain in the short, medium and long term.”

In January, Müller announced the introduction of a new recyclable cap in the UK, which uses 13% less plastic. All the company’s branded and private-label fresh milk products in the country now include the lighter cap.",Müller Milk & Ingredients eyes milk and cream SKU reduction
