“Our operating profit margin (beia) decreased by 17bps due to the first time consolidation of Brazil, rising input costs and adverse currency developments. A key milestone in 2018 was the announcement of the strategic partnership with CRE to join forces in China, a big opportunity for both companies, which is pending regulatory approval.”

Valentine's Day spending 2019 to increase as GlobalData has predicted consumers will be spending over £1bn on valentine's gifts.,12 February 2019,https://www.drinks-insight-network.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2019/02/Heart.jpg,https://www.drinks-insight-network.com/news/valentines-day-spending-2019/,"Data and analytics company GlobalData has predicted Valentine’s Day spending in the UK will be worth over £1bn this year – up to 0.7% higher than in 2018.

Retailers are appealing to shoppers by offering romantic Valentine’s meals that can be made at home to avoid expensive takeaways or busy dining-out experiences. Supermarkets such as Morrisons, Tesco and Waitrose are offering three to four-course meals with a bottle of wine or fizz for £20 and under.

Valentine’s Day gifts remain the largest category in the market, with analysts predicting it to grow by 0.5% this year. The increase in spending is driven by food and drink gifts with these items being more affordable than accessories such as leather goods, which are predicted to decline in popularity in 2019.



GlobalData analyst Zoe Mills said: “Consumers want to participate in this event, however, for many, spending on dining out and a lavish gift is not affordable. This is a positive result for retailers who may be seeing a lull in footfall after the busy Christmas peak.

“The focus on product quality among the discounters is forecast to hinder growth in the food and drink market as shoppers trade down, however growth in this category remains robust at 1.3% in 2019, compared to +1.5% in 2018.

“For many shoppers, a Valentine’s Day gift is a token of affection rather than an extravagant expense, and as such, the average amount spent on gifts is much less than spent on other events such as birthdays and Christmas. Key gifting categories will be jewellery, particularly for female recipients, and food and drink gifts such as the traditional box of chocolates and items such as Champagne or Prosecco.

“Retailers should highlight different price points in their Valentine’s Day gifting ranges to ensure customers can find an option that is affordable for them.”

According to retail and shopper marketing agency Savvy, retail sales will reach £853m, an increase of 7.8% from 2018, with % of consumers saying they do not mind spending more to make Valentine’s Day special for their partner.

CEO of point-of-sale specialist Ecrebo David Buckingham commented: “Seasonal events such as Valentine’s Day provide a prime opportunity for retailers to drive footfall and increase sales. However, it’s important not to forgo personalisation in favour of mass promotions. All year round rewards are one of the things that keep customers coming back. As a result, there should be a balance between delivering day-to-day value and event-driven promotions.”",UK consumers set to spend more this Valentine’s Day: GlobalData report

The new project will assess the sustainability of the stevia sweetener supply chain.

Stevia is a naturally sourced low-calorie sweetener that is used by beverage and food producers as a sugar alternative. These substances also lower the calorie content of products.



Tate & Lyle sweetener platform innovation and global marketing vice-president Abigail Storms said: “As a leading provider of stevia to the food industry, Tate & Lyle wants to ensure that using stevia in greater quantities in the future as a replacement for sugar is a responsible choice for Tate & Lyle, as well as a healthy choice for consumers around the world.”

“Stevia farming is a key economic activity in many areas in China and a rapidly growing global ingredient for sugar replacement.”

Earthwatch will lead the stevia supply chain review, identifying steps that would ensure the regular incorporation of sustainable growing practices and the optimisation of socio-economic benefits.

Tate & Lyle, Sweet Green Fields and Earthwatch will use the research insights to establish sustainability best practice across its supply chains.

The majority of stevia used in Tate & Lyle and Sweet Green Fields’ products is grown in China. Earthwatch-led scientists have already started ground research in the country to evaluate the socio-environmental impacts of stevia production.

The non-profit organisation also plans to engage with a wide range of stakeholders in the stevia supply chain, from seedling producers to family-run planters and industrial farms.

Earthwatch senior research manager Steven Loiselle said: “Stevia farming is a key economic activity in many areas in China and a rapidly growing global ingredient for sugar replacement. By working with local scientists and experts within China we are developing new knowledge for both Tate & Lyle, the broader stevia industry and local communities.”","Tate & Lyle, Earthwatch and Sweet Green Fields launch stevia sustainability project"

"The sales of Australian wine grew more than production in 2017-18 by approximately seven million cases, which is 5% of production.",5 February 2019,https://www.drinks-insight-network.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2019/02/photo-1506377247377-2a5b3b417ebb.jpg,https://www.drinks-insight-network.com/news/australian-wine-sales/,"The sales of Australian wine grew more than production in 2017-2018 by approximately seven million cases, marking a 5% increase, according to Wine Australia’s Australian Wine: Production, Sales and Inventory report 2017-2018.

This is the greatest margin since 2010-2011 and witnessed tightening of stocks.

Stable domestic demand and an increase in exports are said to be one of the key drivers for the total sales increase during the financial year.



Total sales increased by just under eight million cases (6%) compared with the earlier financial year, while a smaller grape crush in 2018 led to a decline of ten million cases (7%) in wine production.

“The average wine grape price in 2018 was the highest since 2008, while the average value of bottled wine exports reached its highest level ever.”

Wine Australia CEO Andreas Clark said: “Sales of Australian wine reached a record volume in 2017–18, driven mainly by exports. Despite wine production being above the long-term average, it was not sufficient to match sales, so there was an overall 5% reduction in wine inventories.”

According to the report, strong demand and tight supply have led to an increase in average value for both grapes and wine. The total estimated value of wine sales during the period was A$6.25bn ($4.5bn).

The report also indicated that the supply shortage last year has led to supply pressure for some Australian red varieties, especially Shiraz and Merlot, heading into the 2019 harvest. Due to an increase in exports to China, the demand for Australian wine is expected to remain stable in the medium term.

Clark added: “The average wine grape price in 2018 was the highest since 2008, while the average value of bottled wine exports reached its highest level ever.

“The International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) Statistical Report on World Vitiviniculture 2018 estimates that world wine production in 2018 was 27.9 billion litres, 13% higher than the previous year (which saw record low production) and, if the estimate is realised, 2018 would see the fourth largest producer in the past 18 years.”

Australian wine exports increased by 11% to A$2.71bn ($1.93bn) in 2017-18, compared with the 2016-17 period, according to figures released by Wine Australia in October 2018.

By 30 September, wine exports increased by 5% in volume to 842 million litres.",Australian wine sales surpassed production in 2017-2018
Anheuser-Busch InBev owned Boxing Cat Brewery and Alibaba’s Tmall Innovation Center have teamed up to make a craft beer tailored for China.,5 February 2019,https://www.drinks-insight-network.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2019/02/Michael-Jordan-Boxing-Cat-2.png,https://www.drinks-insight-network.com/news/boxing-cat-brewery-alibaba/,"Anheuser-Busch InBev company Boxing Cat Brewery and Alibaba’s Tmall Innovation Center (TMIC) have teamed up to develop a craft beer specifically for the Chinese market.

Boxing Cat Brewery brewmaster Michael Jordan and his team worked with TMIC in this endeavour.

For creating the beer, Boxing Cat used TMIC’s analytics and consumer feedback in order to understand the requirements of Chinese beer enthusiasts.



Based on the feedback, the brewery created a porter beer, called ‘Big Luck Big Win’, which had hints of orange and chocolate. The beverage was launched on Tmall just in time for Chinese New Year.

“We can’t expect all trends to be driven by the American craft beer scene or the English craft beer scene. There is a lot of inspiration to draw from China.”

Jordan said: “This is a complete reverse approach. We can directly work with the consumers to find out their preferences. This bypasses the sales and marketing steps and just goes straight to the brewers to create a new product based on what they prefer.”

Founded in April 2017, TMIC makes use of consumer insights from Alibaba’s nearly 700 million shoppers in order to help brands such as AB InBev to create innovative products, services and marketing campaigns for the China market.

The research includes online surveys, offline events, and algorithms to study consumer behaviour.

Boxing Cat brand manager Kelsey Willis said: “TMIC has direct access to the Chinese consumers, and it is really able to give us a more-targeted idea about who we want to move forward and create beers for them. When we get information from TMIC, it’s not a broad stroke. It’s insightful and targeted data.”

“We can’t expect all trends to be driven by the American craft beer scene or the English craft beer scene. There is a lot of inspiration to draw from China.”

China’s beer market is burgeoning, driven by its growing middle-class. According to a forecast by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the middle-class population is expected to reach around 850 million by 2030.

In October 2018, Alibaba signed an agreement to make an investment of RMB2bn ($288.3m) in local wine and spirits importer 1919.cn.

This investment gives Alibaba a 29% stake in the company, making it the second largest stakeholder of the company.",Boxing Cat Brewery and Alibaba to create new beer for Chinese market
AB InBev will be trialing a LNG lorry for two weeks to transport their beer across the UK in hopes to reduce the use of emissions.,5 February 2019,https://www.drinks-insight-network.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2019/02/IVECO.jpg,https://www.drinks-insight-network.com/news/ab-inbev-trial-lng-lorry/,"International brewer AB InBev will pilot using a low-carbon lorry to carry shipments of beer from its brewery in Samlesbury, Lancashire.

Powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG), it will transport beer brands including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Beck’s and Bud Light.

The use of LNG will aim to reduce carbon dioxide (CO ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particular matter (PM) and noise emissions.



This trial will be a first for the UK and will take place over the next two weeks using the new IVECO Stralis NP tractor from transport company H Parkinson Haulage (HPH).

The lorry delivers the best fuel efficiency over long-distance journeys when it offers up to 15% improvement in fuel consumption and has the lowest pollutant emissions.

The vehicle can carry up to 1,560 cases of beer and will be monitored by AB InBev and HPH to assess the environmental savings it makes.

If the lorry shows emission savings in the two week trial, AB InBev has pledged to keep the vehicle on the road permanently.

According to IVECO, the LNG lorry is already recognised as an environmentally cleaner alternative to traditional diesel-powered trucks. It achieves emissions reductions of up to 15%-80% of C0 , 60% of NOx and 99% of PM, as well as a noise reduction of 19dbs.

Samlesbury brewery manager Stanislav Chulkov said: “We are delighted that Samlesbury is the chosen location to trial the pioneering sustainable technology, in a first for AB InBev in the UK.

“We are constantly looking for new ways to improve the efficiency of our operations and make better use of our resources, so we hope that the LNG trial is another step towards reducing our carbon footprint and meeting our 2025 sustainability goals.”

This new initiative is another step towards one of AB InBev’s four 2025 sustainability goals, to reduce 25% of CO emissions across the value chain.",AB InBev to trial LNG truck beer delivery in UK

Published as part of the ‘Statistics on Alcohol, England 2019’ report, these figures have risen by 15% in the last decade.

The figure was calculated using a combination of clinical coding and alcohol-attributable fractions (AAF), a methodology developed by North West Public Health Observatory that estimates what proportion of cases of a health condition are alcohol-related.



This method sees patient notes translated into coded data featuring a primary code (the main reason for admission) and up to 19 secondary codes (other diagnoses that affect treatment).

PHE’s latest published figure only included admissions where an alcohol-related disease, injury or condition was the primary code. A broader measure considering several other conditions that are often caused by alcohol increases that figure to 1.2 million.

“Adults in higher income households were more likely to drink 14 units or more in a week.”

The report also showed that alcohol-related admissions accounted for a similar percentage of overall hospital admissions last year, with 2.1% in 2017-18 and 2.1% in 2016-17.

In addition, it was found that people aged 45 or over accounted for 69% of admissions where alcohol was the primary code.

The report revealed that there were 5,800 alcohol-specific deaths in 2017-18, representing a 6% rise from 2016-17. Liver disease accounted for 80% of the alcohol-specific deaths in 2017-18.

Alcohol-specific death rates were the highest in the most deprived areas (30.1 deaths per 100,000 people for men and 13.5 for women) and the lowest in the least deprived areas (seven deaths per 100,000 people for men and four for women).

The report also revealed that 21% of people aged 16 and over drank more than 14 units of alcohol a week in 2017-18. Of these, 28% were men and 14% were women.

Adults in higher income households were more likely to drink 14 units or more in a week (27%) than those in lower-income households (15%).

Furthermore, girls (11%) aged 11 to 15 were more likely to have been drunk in the last four weeks than boys (7%) in 2016-17.

According to PHE, 76,000 people were treated for problematic drinking in 2017-18, which is 6% lower than in 2016-17.

The newly published data comes from the PHE’s ‘Local Area Profiles for England’ report, which uses data from NHS Digital’s Hospital Episode Statistics.","Alcohol was main cause for hospital admissions last year, says PHE"

Off-trade sales such as those made at supermarkets and convenience stores increased by 4.7%, while on-trade sales in pubs increased by 0.1% compared with beer sales in 2017.

Total beer sales were down by 1.7% in Q1, but grew consistently in the months afterwards. Sales increased by 3.6% in Q2, 4.4% in Q3, and 3.1% in Q4, making 2018 a record year for beer.



According to BBPA, the increase in beer sales during Q2 and Q3 was down to England’s progress at the World Cup, which drove footfall in pubs from fans watching the games.

BBPA chief executive Brigid Simmonds said: “2018 has been a good year for beer and pubs. Considering the heavy cost burdens the industry faces from high beer duty, business rates and rising costs in general, it’s great to see beer sales doing the best they have for some years.

“A significant amount of the growth in beer sales in 2018 can be attributed to the England team’s performance at the World Cup and the good weather over the summer months.

“The Chancellor’s decision in the 2018 Autumn Budget to freeze beer tax also appears to have had an immediate impact, with sales of beer in pubs growing in the last quarter of 2018 by 2.2%. This shows just how important reducing the beer tax burden is to boosting sales of beer and helping pubs with their footfall.

“As the UK’s alcohol drink of choice, which continues to have a much bigger, positive impact on the UK economy than any other drink, it is important that beer continues to do well and that the Chancellor continues to support pubs.”

BBPA said that pubs and off-trade businesses cannot rely on the World Cup and good weather for growth of sales every year.

Beer sales grew 2.2% at the end of 2018, the first time Q4 beer sales grew in the on-trade sector since 2011, down in part to the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s decision to freeze beer, cider and spirit duties in the most recent budget.",UK beer sales increase in on and off-trade sectors

"The UK government has introduced consultations to revamp the country’s waste system, reduce plastic pollution, and move towards a more circular economy.",18 February 2019,https://www.drinks-insight-network.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2019/02/Marine-Litter.jpg,https://www.drinks-insight-network.com/news/uk-consultations-reduce-plastic-waste/,"The UK Government has introduced consultations to revamp the country’s waste system, reduce plastic pollution, and move towards a more circular economy.

Building on the government’s Resources and Waste Strategy, the consultations will focus on enabling packaging producers to pay the full cost to tackle packaging waste.

They will also focus on bringing a consistent set of materials collected across England from households for recycling.



The government is planning to introduce a Deposit Return Scheme (DRS) for cans and bottles, which is expected to recycle around three billion plastic bottles.

As part of the consultations, the government will ask companies to follow a consistent labelling system on packaging to allow consumers to know what they can recycle.

It will also focus on introducing food waste collections for every household in England as well as free garden waste collections for households with gardens.

Consultations focus on introducing a tax on plastic packaging that does not meet a minimum threshold of 30% recycled content starting in April 2022.

“We will introduce a world-leading tax to boost recycled content in plastic packaging.”

UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: “We are committed to going further and faster to reduce, reuse, recycle and cut waste. That’s why we are leading the way to move away from being a ‘throw-away’ society and drive up domestic recycling.

“Through our plans, we will introduce a world-leading tax to boost recycled content in plastic packaging, make producers foot the bill for handling their packaging waste and end the confusion over household recycling.

“We are committed to cementing our place as a world leader in resource efficiency, so we can be the first generation to leave our environment in a better state than we inherited it.”

The government is also planning to introduce a consistent set of recyclable materials for collection in England in a move to increase household recycling levels.

It will also work towards identifying ways to implement this move as well as exploring options to include widely recyclable materials such as plastic bottles and pots, tubs and trays, glass packaging, paper and card, as well as metal packaging under the scheme.

Biffa head of environment and external affairs Jeff Rhodes commented: “We’re pleased to see the government progressing some of the key consultations proposed in last year’s Resources and Waste Strategy.

“It’s vital we find ways to use our resources more efficiently and the various new schemes being consulted on having the potential to drive this, so long as they are developed and implemented realistically and consistently across the supply chains and Great Britain.”

TOMRA Collection Solutions UK and Ireland managing director Truls Haug said: “TOMRA is involved in deposit return schemes in more than 60 markets, so we have vast experience in this area. We look forward to sharing our knowledge on how to ensure the scheme is as effective as possible.

“Successful deposit return schemes can play a significant role in sparking a recycling revolution and we will be watching with interest to see the consultation results in due course.”

A Plastic Planet co-founder Sian Sutherland commented: “In the UK we throw away 300 billion pieces of plastic every year. We recycle 9% of it in the UK. We export a huge amount to developing countries. We need a giant stride not a fairy step and we need it now, not in 2022.

“We need Michael Gove to be strong on this. Already we are seeing signs of the strategy being watered down. We owe it to our children that we step up and do the right thing now and do not falter. In ten years time we will be answerable to them – not to the oil lobbyists.”",UK introduces consultations to reduce plastic packaging waste

Constellation Brands CFO David Klein announced the plans during the food and consumer products event Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) in Boca Raton, Florida, US.

Klein was quoted by Reuters as saying: “Everything that’s not a power brand, you can assume that we’re either going to sell it, discontinue it or milk it very quickly over the next year or so.”



Last October, Reuters reported that Constellation was planning to offload certain wine brands in the US in a transaction that could be worth more than $3bn.

Constellation Brands is also in the process of optimising its wine and spirits business to increase growth rates and operating margins.

“Everything that’s not a power brand, you can assume that we’re either going to sell it, discontinue it or milk it very quickly over the next year or so.”

Cannabis alcohol report finds that US drinks trade needs to prepare for the expanding demand for cannabis in the alcohol trade.,22 February 2019,https://www.drinks-insight-network.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2019/02/cannabis.jpg,https://www.drinks-insight-network.com/news/cannabis-alcohol-report/,"A cooperative initiative between drinks market analysis company IWSR and BDS Analytics has released a report that shows the growth of marijuana use could affect the US alcohol business.

The report finds 45% of millennial consumers are dualists’ who consume both cannabis and alcohol and suggests alcoholic drink companies need to prepare to meet consumers’ needs as the market expands.

The report, ‘Beverage Alcohol, Cannabis and the Changing U.S. Consumer: What are the Real Risks and Opportunities to Consumption Behaviour?’ found that 37% of alcohol drinkers in legal cannabis states also consume cannabis and the statistic is expected to grow as the acceptance of marijuana increases.



It also showed that on average the cannabis and alcohol dualists are more likely to drink beer and spirits compared with wine drinkers.

Cannabis consumption has increased in recent years with ten states approving its use as a recreational drug and 34 states approving it for medical purposes.

BDS Analytics vice-president Jessica Lukas said: “Our research shows that up to 40% of adults 21 and over consumes cannabis in states where it’s legal. Cannabis presents substantial opportunities across consumer industries, including new occasions that alcohol cannot and will not play.

“Consumers will continue to look to cannabis products over alcohol for occasions when they are feeling creative, need to get motivated, or seeking health, medical or wellness benefits.”

IWSR US president Brandy Rand said: “Though not yet mainstream, cannabis adoption is certainly growing in states where it’s legal and does pose a risk to the beverage alcohol industry in the future.

“It’s important that alcohol brands pay attention to their consumers, recognizing that some occasions may result in a decrease in alcohol consumption in place of, or alongside, legal cannabis.”",US drinks trade needs to adapt for cannabis users: Report

The brewery can now produce 1,000 proof gallons of oak-matured spirits per day while using 80-95% less wood than regular spirit production.

Worldwide demand for spirits is increasing. According to the Distilled Spirits Council, consumption of American whiskey stood at more than $3.4bn in revenue in 2018, while exports to the UK grew twofold between 2008 and 2018. Other spirits such as rum and gin also saw similar growth.



In addition, demand for craft spirits is growing and consumers are looking for a wider range of flavours and aromas.

“While increasing our production from small-scale units to full production units, we have been able to drop capital costs by more than 90% on a proof gallon basis.”

To cater to this growing consumer demand, the firm’s technology includes maturation methods that absorb wood flavors and remove unwanted elements, as well as filter, extract and refine added flavors.

Next Century Spirits CEO Scott Bolin said: “The chemical reactions that occur during spirits maturation, from direct extraction to decomposition of wood macromolecules and evaporation of volatile compounds, are incredibly complex.

“Reproducing these processes more efficiently while maintaining quality is a huge challenge in the industry. We are fortunate to have a team in place whose depth of experience meets the breadth of this challenge.”

Next Century’s technology is used by brands such as Creek Water, a 100-proof American Whiskey launched by recording artist Yelawolf.

NC State University associate professor of forest biomaterials Joel Pawlak said: “One of the most compelling aspects of this technology is its scalability. While increasing our production from small-scale units to full production units, we have been able to drop capital costs by more than 90% on a proof gallon basis.

“The high throughput of the technology greatly streamlines supply chain management of distilled spirits. This is a major benefit to small brand and private label customers seeking to rapidly grow their business.

“In addition, our ability to co-locate this technology, to easily integrate it into existing distillery facilities anywhere in the world, is of great interest to established brands.”

The company aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% per kilo of milk over the next ten years to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

The new initiative covers Arla Food’s whole value chain and the company has set the sustainability target for all markets where it operates. It anticipates that some countries might reach the target ahead of schedule.



Arla Foods chairman and dairy farmer Jan Toft Nørgaard said: “We want to leverage our position as the leading international farming cooperative with 10,300 farmers and perhaps the most comprehensive understanding of dairy farming and production in Northern Europe to accelerate the transition to sustainable dairy production.

“We are in a strong position to ensure that people maintain confidence in dairy as part of a healthy and sustainable diet for the future.”

“We have worked towards sustainable farming for years and we need to go further and faster, not least to help fight climate change, which affects everyone on the planet, especially us farmers.”

Arla Foods explained that the majority of emissions in the dairy value chain come from farms, but it is not possible to reduce a cow’s methane emissions completely.

However, emission levels can be reduced significantly through optimised feed composition, which is a research area that the Danish firm is currently investing in.

Arla Foods CEO Peder Tuborgh added: “With our farmers’ further commitment, we are in a strong position to ensure that people maintain confidence in dairy as part of a healthy and sustainable diet for the future.

Martini Fiero is claimed to offer a bittersweet orange flavour that has been crafted to pair with tonic water.



Martini master herbalist Ivano Tonutti said: “Creating Martini Fiero was an exercise in balance. From a botanical point of view, it was essential to harmonise the vibrant citrus notes of the Murcia orange peel with the bitterness and herbal aromatics of the artemisia alongside the many other botanicals, which, in turn, had to sit happily alongside the quinine in tonic.”

“Creating Martini Fiero was an exercise in balance.”

With this launch, Bacardi aims to meet the growing demand for bold-flavoured, brightly coloured drinks.

Martini master blender Beppe Musso said: “We also worked hard to ensure the intense flavours of our white wine and citrus core would come through when the tonic is added.

“We are proud of the result – a modern vermouth with a distinctive bittersweet orange flavour that comes to life when paired with tonic. Martini Fiero is the ideal drink for the modern aperitivo.”

From January to March 2017, 6.4 million bottles of gin were sold in the UK, which soared to nine million bottles during the same period in 2018. Over the 2018 Christmas period, gin sales were up 40% over 2017.

Last year flavoured gin was valued at £165m, showing an enormous increase of 751% compared with 2017 as more brands brought out speciality gins.



Combined sales of British gin in the UK and for the export market have doubled in the last five years. There are 361 distilleries in the UK, more than double the amount in the country five years ago, and more than double the number of gins are available in the UK than in 2011.

Wine and Spirit Trade Association chief executive Miles Beale said: “The truly staggering rise in gin sales shows that British gin is gaining more and more fans by the day. And we fully expect to see sales rise again in March this year, just as they did last year.

“Its high time gin’s new status and reputation were celebrated and supported by Government, which should be offering more support for British gin exports and a less taxing duty regime, both of which fails to support our entrepreneurial and innovative distillers.”

Pickering’s Gin co-founder Marcus Pickering said: “In terms of global thirst for British products, distilling in Britain and Scotland specifically has become world-renowned for producing high-quality products.”

This small-batch beverage is the fifth addition to the Bulleit Frontier Whiskey family and it uses the same 95% rye and 5% malted barley recipe as its predecessor.



The new offering combines dried orchard fruit, spice and oak fragrances with flavours of dried pear, light toffee and oak, with a hint of graham cracker spice.

Bulleit Frontier Whiskey US & Global brand director Ed Bello said: “Rye remains the fastest growing North American Whiskey segment and Bulleit Rye has been the number one super premium Rye brand in the last six years.

“Rye’s signature spiciness is certainly still prominent, and this extra ageing complements that without being overwhelming.”

“With higher-end whiskeys driving much of that sales growth and a limited number of aged statement ryes on the market, Bulleit Rye 12-Year-Old is a natural way to expand our portfolio and provide a new ultra-premium offering that’s absolutely delicious.”

Bottled at 92 proof (46% ABV), the 12-year-aged rye whiskey will be priced around $50 per 750ml bottle.

The offering is currently available in select US markets, including Kentucky, Texas, New York and Ohio.

Bulleit Frontier Whiskey blender Andrew Mackay said: “Whiskey is heavily influenced by barrel ageing, and as a blender, one of our most important responsibilities is to taste how the wood impacts the flavour of the liquid and brings out different notes.

“The barrels we mingled to produce Bulleit Rye 12-Year-Old were hand-selected for ageing based on early identification of their superior quality. Rye’s signature spiciness is certainly still prominent, and this extra ageing complements that without being overwhelming as new levels of softness, clove character and vanilla and oak notes are evident.”",Bulleit Frontier launches 12-year-aged rye whiskey

Taylor further added: “Some have been straightforward, like stopping using bottled water and introducing the use of electric vehicles, or more complicated, like habitat protection, wildlife corridor agreements with landowners for barley growing or engineering a solution that re-uses the hot waste-water from distillation.”

“These actions are just the beginning of a long-term vision to be more sustainable in all we do and to leave behind a bright future for generations to come.”

The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has proposed to revise rules to amend the allowable level of fluoride in bottled water.,4 April 2019,,https://www.drinks-insight-network.com/news/usfda-proposes-revise-fluoride/,"The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has suggested a revision to the acceptable level of fluoride in bottled water.

If approved, the limit would be reduced to 0.7mg per litre, bringing it in line with the recommended level set by the US Public Health Service (PHS) for community water companies that add fluoride to improve dental health.

In 2015, the FDA suggested that the bottled water industry should also follow these recommendations, and several manufacturers have already taken preparatory steps as a result.



The latest proposal will be applicable to both bottled water that is produced in the US, as well as those imported into the country.

“Too much fluoride over a long time when teeth are forming under the gums can cause changes in the appearance of tooth enamel.”

The FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition director Susan Mayne said: “Fluoride provides an important public health benefit by helping to reduce cavities and tooth decay. But too much fluoride over a long time when teeth are forming under the gums can cause changes in the appearance of tooth enamel, called dental fluorosis.

“Striking the right balance is especially important for children under the age of 8 as their permanent teeth are still forming. It’s the FDA’s responsibility to ensure that if fluoride is added to bottled water, it is added at appropriate levels so that consumers receive its important health benefit while also being protected from potential adverse effects.

The FDA further noted that the proposed rule will not be applicable for bottled water where fluoride is not added by the manufacturer.

Mayne further added that the recommendation: “provides an optimal balance between the prevention of dental caries and the risk of dental fluorosis.”

The FDA will allow a 60-day comment period to receive feedback from the public, the industry and other stakeholders.",USFDA proposes to revise fluoride levels in bottled water

The agreement will increase the production of Speyside’s single malt whisky by 66% to one million litres a year.

Luzhou Laojiao will distribute the distillery’s Spey and Beinn Dubh brands in China, where sales of Scotch whisky have been increasing.



The agreement will place the company’s spirits portfolio in duty-free outlets across China and other key markets.

Speyside Distillers CEO John McDonough said: “Although our brands have been present in China for a number of years, most of the distribution and sales activity has been within the southern provinces.

“This distribution agreement with Luzhou Laojiao will enable us to move to a completely different level and will help to meet the growing demand for single malt Scotch whisky from China’s urbanised, affluent young professionals.

The Scottish firm expects that supply-demand for global duty-free and duty paid within China will have a significant impact on production.

The international reach of Speyside Distillery is reported to have grown significantly in the last five years and the brands are currently available in 34 different countries.

Speyside Distillery managing director Patricia Dillon said: “Due to John’s existing business operations in Taiwan when he bought the distillery, we were very quickly able to cultivate a market for Spey in that territory and it has historically always been a key driver for sales.

“Around 70% of our global sales currently come from that region, but this agreement with Luzhou Laojiao for global duty-free and internally within China sets us on a path that will challenge the volume that we have in Taiwan.”",Speyside Distillery signs distribution deal to meet whisky demand

The drinks contain minerals which the company claims help consumers perform to the best of their abilities when used as part of a healthy diet and balanced lifestyle. Flavours include lemon with zinc, which it says contributes to normal cognitive function, and lime with magnesium, which helps to reduce tiredness and fatigue.

The launch of the new water range will be supported by a fully-integrated marketing campaign starting in May focusing on consumers leading busy and constantly varied lives. The “Put back what life takes out” campaign will feature digital outdoor and banner advertising as well as in-store activations including displays and sampling.



Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland general manager Jon Woods said: “We are continually looking for ways to expand our portfolio and give people a wider choice of drinks to suit different tastes, lifestyles and occasions.

“Aquarius provides a new great-tasting option for everyday moments when you are looking for a revitalising way to hydrate, with added minerals, and will play an important role in our ambition to continue to offer consumers more choice.”

All packaging for the new beverage is 100% recyclable and the bottles contain 25% recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) that works towards Coca-Cola’s sustainable packaging goal, to collect and recycle the equivalent of every bottle or can it sells globally by 2030.

Earlier this month Coca-Cola released its own energy drink to the UK to expand its drink portfolio, with no-sugar and no-calorie options.

Coca Cola’s CMO of sparkling Javier Meza told Marketing Week: “The reason we’ve been able to do that is this notion of ‘it’s OK to try new things’ and if it is not a big success that you don’t have to keep it for years.

EC’s decision came after a three-year investigation into AB InBev’s Jupiler brand in Belgium which has a 40% market share.

In June 2016, EC opened an antitrust investigation on the company to investigate if it used its dominant position on the Belgian beer market by hindering imports of its beer from neighbouring countries.

EC noted that AB InBev pursued a deliberate strategy to restrict the possibility for supermarkets and wholesalers to buy Jupiler beer at lower prices in the Netherlands and to import it into Belgium.



This way the company could maintain higher prices in Belgium by limiting imports of less expensive beer products from the Netherlands.



EC Commissioner in charge of competition policy Margrethe Vestager said: “Consumers in Belgium have been paying more for their favourite beer because of AB InBev’s deliberate strategy to restrict cross border sales between the Netherlands and Belgium.

“Attempts by dominant companies to carve up the Single Market to maintain high prices are illegal.”
