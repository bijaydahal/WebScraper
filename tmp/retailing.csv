Robinson joined the company nearly nine years ago, initially managing all UK grocery multiples, before moving on to manage the off-trade channel for five years.

He will now be responsible for the off-trade, on-trade, cash & carry and routes to market, and he will also be tasked with developing Kopparberg’s core packaged business, alongside the brand’s premium draught proposition and evolving further NPD.

Meanwhile an internal restructure has taken place to create a new senior sales team to drive the business channels forward.

Anthony Clarey, who is stepping down from the operational role of on-trade sales director to pursue other business interests, will remain involved in the Kopparberg business on a consultancy basis.

Peter Bronsman, owner and managing director of Kopparberg Breweries, said: “Neil’s experience in the off-trade channel has been invaluable to the business, delivering brilliant results as our UK business has grown year-on-year. He has a strong understanding of Kopparberg and our central vision for being the UK’s number one fruit cider brand across both the on and off Trade. Neil’s appointment comes at an exciting time for the brand, with category defining NPD launching this year.”

Neil Robinson said: “I’m honoured to be taking on this new role, of which Anthony has made fantastic groundwork for me to build from. The off trade continues to see positive volume growth, but we need to be careful to grow in the right way. My new role will see new challenges in terms of leading the on trade and aligning with continually evolving retailer and market trends, which is more important than ever.

“I am looking forward to working closely with the wider sales team, marketing, the brewery and the new senior sales team to develop the Kopparberg brand for our customers and continue to drive the total cider category.”

Last year the company launched Kopparberg Rhubarb, Kopparberg Passionfruit, and its first draught variant of Kopparberg Black.

The family-run producer has prepared infused rums using a traditional method since 1973 in Cap Ferret, near Bordeaux in France.

In 2009 Franck Oksen created his own range, with the aim of launching these into the wider market.

He said: “The three different flavours in the range all use natural ingredients and they have done well in taste competitions. They are attracting a lot of interest and I am now ready to launch these into the UK market.”

The drinks use agricultural rum from Martinique, blended with a range of spices, berries and fruits and using a natural and slow maceration process.

The first in the range is made with entire cinnamon sticks, macerated for a length of time to ensure the spice and woody flavours are present in the drink. The second uses bananas from Ecuador, while the third uses vanilla beans.

Famille Oksen has raised E100,000 via crowdfunding platform Seedrs and it is currently seeking an importer and distributor in the UK. Oksen is also exploring other European markets.

The first edition of Theodore Gin has been created with guidance from olfactory expert and perfume designer, Barnabe Fillion.

The gin is made using 16 botanicals including pine, Damask rose, pomelo and bourbon vetiver, which have been distilled in a multi-stage process using an old charentais still alongside a rotovap to extract the best flavours and aromas from each.

The gin is the first spirit produced at the new Ardross Distillery, although a limited-edition batch was released earlier this year. It will be priced at £39 for a 70cl bottle.

The brand name has been inspired by the spirit of the Picts, an ancient tribe that once settled near the brand’s home in Ardoss, Northern Highlands. The tribe is alleged to have travelled from as far as Scythia and Scandinavia to settle in the Scottish Highlands during the late Iron Age and early medieval periods. Theodore de Bry was a 16th century engraver who brought the Picts to life through his art.

Founder Barthelemy Brosseau said: “We have collaborated with an eclectic team of individuals who are pushing boundaries in their respective fields to create something special. Theodore pays tribute to the Picts with a bold and characterful gin that embodies the Pictish spirit. It is for anyone who is looking to whet a curious appetite.”

Greenwood Distillers was founded in 2018 by Barthlemy Brousseau and presided by “legendary chief blender” Andrew Rankin. It will operate its Scotch whisky distillery later on this year and its portfolio already has a diverse range of global spirits including gin, mezcal, Armagnac and whisky. It has plans to “build bridges from Scotland to Kentucky (boubon) and Japan (Japanese whisky).

The Wine & Spirit Education Trust (WSET) and International Wine & Spirit Competition (IWSC) have joined forces to celebrate their 50th anniversaries.

The duo have announced they will launch ‘The Future 50’, a new initiative that aims to recognise the next generation of top wine and spirits professionals.

The Future 50 awards will identify 50 of the global industry’s up-and-coming talent from all areas of the trade at a range of levels.

It will be open to those working in product development, design and distribution through to marketing, journalism, hospitality and everything in between.

The WSET and IWSC are calling on professionals across the industry to nominate themselves or impressive colleagues for the awards. Nominees must be under 40 years of age and can be working in any profession as long as they prove direct contribution to the industry.

The winners will be chosen by an illustrious panel of judges from around the world including Joe Fattorini (The Wine Show), Stephanie Macleod (Master Blender, Dewar’s), Christine Parkinson (Group Head of Wine, Hakkasan), Richard Paterson (Master Blender, Whyte & Mackay), Xavier Rousset MS (restaurateur), Ian Harris (CEO - WSET), and Allen Gibbons (CEO - IWSC).

The main judging panel will be supported by a global regional advisory panel covering 17 countries and including Debra Meiburg MW (Hong Kong), Ian Dai (China), James Tidwell MS (USA) and Pedro Ballesteros MS (Spain).

Judges will assess nominees based on their achievements in the drinks industry in the last three years in a range of areas including, but not limited to, career, academia, social responsibility and innovation.

The final ‘Future 50’ will be announced in November 2019 ahead of IWSC’s annual Awards Banquet. Nominations are open until March 14, 2019. Visit http://bit.ly/Future50Awards for more information.

Ian Harris, WSET Chief Executive, said: “Both WSET and IWSC have reputations as the international benchmark for excellence in our fields. As 2019 marks 50 years of success for each of our organisations, it offers the perfect opportunity to emphasise the importance of developing new talent through education and awards to secure an equally prosperous future for the industry. At WSET we are delighted to be looking to the future and showcasing the next generation of talent in the wines and spirits industry through our joint Future 50 project.""

IWSC Chief Executive, Allen Gibbons, said: “The IWSC and WSET are both founded in 50 years of heritage and unparalleled industry expertise, but the Future 50 is as much about looking ahead as it is about looking backwards. As we set our sights on the next 50 years, it’s important to identify and recognise the key players who are going to be setting the trends for decades to come.

""The Future 50 is our way of demonstrating support for those who will be driving forward the top quality standards that have been set across the industry – from brands, to products, to venues – and ensuring that the drinks world continues to innovate and advance.”

The brand, which is produced by the Waldhorn Distillery in Berglen, near Stuttgart, does flag up its German origins on the label.

Despite this, the SWA claimed the product could confuse consumers – specifically because of the inclusion of the word “Glen” in the branding - and “mislead them as to the true origin of the whisky”. In a dispute that started in 2013, the SWA claimed the word “Glen” could make consumers believe the product was produced in Scotland.

The court has now ruled that the German Whisky has breached the geographical indication (GI) of Scotch Whisky by using the word “Glen”.

The dispute started when the SWA took legal action through Hamburg’s regional court, which then asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to interpret the GI to help assess the use of the word “Glen” in this case.

The ECJ started that for the GI to have been breached the word “Glen” must make consumers think of Scotch whisky, as well as conjuring up images of Scotland. The decision was made this week by the Hamburg court, which ruled that the word on a German whisky could confuse and mislead consumers.

Alan Park, SWA’s Director of Legal Affairs, said: “The SWA has consistently taken action in our global markets to prevent the use of Scottish indicators of origin on whisky to prevent the use of Scottish indications of origin on whisky, which is not Scotch Whisky. This is vital to protecting Scotland’s national drink and is a deterrent to those who seek to take advantage of the quality reputation of Scotch Whisky and potentially mislead consumers.

“Courts across many jurisdictions have ruled that names, such as “Highland” and “Glen” and images, such as bagpipers, are so strongly associated with Scotland and Scotch Whisky that their use on whisky of another origin is misleading.

“Our case against Glen Buchenback presented clear and compelling evidence to the court that ‘Glen’ is strongly associated with Scotland and Scotch Whisky, and the only reason to use ‘Glen’ for a German whisky is because of its undoubted association with Scotch Whisky.

“We are pleased with the court’s decision that the use of Glen on a German whisky is misleading.”

Beefeater is bidding to capitalise on the soaring popularity of flavoured gin by launching a new Blood Orange variant.

Gin remains the star performer in the UK drinks trade, with sales up 48% to £903 million in the past year (Nielsen).

Within this popular category, flavoured gin is leading the charge after growing sales by 457% in the past year. It is now a £253 million sub-category in its own right, accounting for more than a quarter of gin sales.

Some purists in the industry lament the advent of flavoured gin, claiming it moves the category away from its heartland and threatens its future health. But the new Beefeater Blood Orange actually takes inspiration from the orange gin distilled by its founder, James Burroughs, all the way back in 1876, when Queen Victoria was made Empress of India and George Eliot was writing Daniel Deronda, so it certainly ticks the heritage and provenance boxes that modern consumers appear to demand.

There is also no denying the success of flavoured gin, as brand owner Pernod Ricard highlighted Beefeater pink gin as the standout performer when it released its H1 results last week. It is growing so strongly that Pernod Ricard has taken the decision to scale back leading wine brands such as Jacob’s Creek and focus on gin, which offers everyone a considerably higher margin.

Pernod Ricard also owns Plymouth gin, which has released a Fruit Cup variant designed to take on Diageo’s Pimm’s brand, and it is keen to continue tapping into this growing market.

“Orange gin has swiftly become the second fastest growing gin flavour, after pink, yet the majority of orange gins currently on the market are only available at a super-premium price,” said Chris Ellis. Beefeater Blood Orange is designed to make the category more accessible to consumers. Ellis said the team was blown away by Beefeater Pink’s success, and it has high hopes for the newcomer.

Beefeater Blood Orange will be released exclusively in the UK and Ireland from next month with an rrp of £18.99. Pernod Ricard recommends serving it with tonic, or perhaps ginger ale, which could represent a cross-merchandising opportunity for retailers.",Beefeater Blood Orange to tap into surging demand for flavoured gin

Vegan wines and a focus on organic and sustainable winemaking will be highlighted at this year’s Wines from Spain annual tasting event.

The event, which takes place on March 7 at London’s Sky Garden, will feature a selection of around 1,000 wines from 300 varieties for visitors to explore, all under one roof.

This year’s event will focus on “some of the growing styles for the environmentally and health-conscious consumer”.

As part of this, there will be a self-pour tasting area dedicated to two themes: Going Green, which focuses on Spain’s organic and sustainable winemaking; and Vegan Wines, covering a selection of Spanish wines suitable for vegan consumers.

One of the mini-tutorials explores this theme further. The Spanish Wines, naturally tutorial, which takes place between 11am and 11.30am and also at 4pm to 4.30pm, will be hosted by Sarah Jane Evans MW, who will present five wines, highlighting recent developments in Spain, and showcasing the new styles of wine produced for today’s increasingly mindful consumer.

Marianne Rodriguez, assistant director at Wines from Spain, told DRN: “The energy and innovation found in Spanish wineries today is resulting in the ever increasing quality of Spanish wines across the board but also in the evolution of the country's production.

“Spain is one of the world's leaders in the production of organic wines. Our geography, climate and winemaking heritage are key factors which allow our grape growers and winemakers to explore or re-discover natural and low intervention practices.

“We are well placed to meet the demands of the increasingly conscious consumers and we are delighted to be able to showcase some of Spain's organic and biodynamic wines at the next Annual Tasting on March 7th as well as present a selection of vegan wines in our self-pour tastings.

“Sarah Jane Evans MW will also be exploring Spain's recent developments and Spain's ability to meet modern consumer expectations. She will cover key topics such as the emergence of natural or amphorae wines, lower abv wines, organic and biodynamic wines. Of course, our 59 exhibitors will have a lot of great examples of these wines on their tables, alongside new vintages and releases. They will also have plenty to say on recent developments.”

A second tutorial – Rueda Verdejo – Spain’s Exceptional White Wine - will take place at 12-12.30pm and again at 3-3.30pm. This event, which looks at the indigenous Verdejo grape, involves a tasting of different styles including young, barrel fermented, sur lie and old vine Verdejos.

Flavoured gin has driven more than half of all growth in gin sales recorded over the last 12 months, despite only making up one fifth of total sales, and almost three quarters of the flavoured gin sector’s growth has been driven by pink gin.

As a result, 2018 was a record year for gin sales with Brits buying 66 million bottles over the 12 months, up 41% on the same period the year before.

Other categories are also benefiting from the interest in pink drinks.

The WSTA’s latest figures show that UK consumers bought more than 100 million bottles of rosé in the off-trade last year, which is more than 2 million more bottles than in the previous year, with value growth of 5%.

Miles Beale chief executive of the WSTA, said: “Pink drinks are increasingly popular thanks to our innovative distillers and wine makers who are responding to consumer demands for quality drinks with a splash of colour.

“We have seen a massive increase in the choices of pink and flavoured gins, there are signs of a renewed fondness in rosé wines and liqueurs like Campari and Aperol mixed with sparkling wine have boosted Brits love of pink cocktails.”

Aldi, which saw huge success last year with its rosé sales, said it expects to sell 13 million bottles in 2019, enough to fill four Olympic swimming pools.

Julie Ashfield, managing director of buying at Aldi UK, said: “We usually see a rise in rosé sales as the weather gets warmer and we move into Spring, but recently we’ve started to see an increased demand for rosé all year round, thanks to drinkers who love to post about it on Instagram, and pair it with a variety of foods.

“To meet this rising demand, we’ve stocked our shelves already and are expecting an early rush on sales. Our new Beaujolais style will be joined by our biggest ever rosé collection this Easter, which we’re confident will be incredibly popular with our shoppers.”

In the cocktail category the popularity of herbal bitter liqueurs mixed with sparkling wine shows an interest in colourful “instagrammable” cocktails, the WSTA said.

During the 2018 heatwave Britons bought more than 4 million bottles of non-cream liqueur cocktails from the off-trade and sales rose by 56% on the same 12 weeks for the year before, which is the equivalent of an extra 1.4 million bottles.

Beale added: “The introduction of new products combined with a fantastic long hot summer has helped boost the pink category and Valentine’s Day will no doubt see another pink spike. There is no doubt that the pink category has benefited by consumers love for sharing vibrant, colourful drink trends on social media.”

Barefoot has leapfrogged Echo Falls, Blossom Hill and McGuigan to become the second most popular wine brand in the UK off-trade.

The Californian powerhouse has grown value sales by 18.5% in the past year and volumes are also up 17.2% (Nielsen, year to October 2018).

That leaves it second only to Hardys in the chart of the UK’s leading wine brands and its average selling price of £6.06 is considerably higher than the others in the top five.

DRN interviewed chief winemaker Jen Wall and European marketing director Olga Senkina to discover the secrets behind this runaway success story.

Wall has helmed the winemaking team at Barefoot since 1995 and she is a pure ray of Californian sunshine, full of excitement and positivity as she discusses her on-going commitment to the Gallo-owned brand’s “foot fans”.

“For 23 years the winemaking directive has been the same: varietally correct, fruit forward, food friendly wine,” she says. “The fruit is the first thing our foot fans detect. Fruit should be there before oak, sugar or acidity.

“Barefoot wines are known to be flavourful and affordable, and Barefoot is the most highly awarded wine brand in US competitions, so when people are looking for that price to quality ratio they like Barefoot. We put a gold medal on every single bottle coming off the line to let our foot fans know about the quality they are getting. Our philosophy is to make affordable wines for everybody to drink on a regular basis.”

Barefoot is now the world’s bestselling wine brand by value (IWSR), so it is perhaps unsurprising that it has done so well in the UK. But it has absolutely soared up the list of the leading off-trade brands in recent years, so the Gallo team in the UK deserves credit. Rival suppliers are certainly full of praise when they discuss Gallo and the work it has done on the Barefoot range.

“When I started we had four types of wine – Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and White Zinfandel – and now we have many more,” says Wall. “We make sure we have something for everybody. We have definitely had to scale up our volume, but our commitment to quality and style has remained consistent.

“It’s really important that we pick the grapes at the right time, in the evening when they are cool and firm, to ensure varietal integrity and to maintain high standards of quality control for our foot fans.”

When asked for her favourite wine in the range, she sounds like a mother being asked to choose a preferred child from her sizeable brood. But she eventually chooses two. “I love them all and they are all wonderful in different circumstances,” she says. “I absolutely love sparkling wine. Our Barefoot sparkling Pinot Grigio, which is available in the UK, is really neat because there aren’t many Californian Pinot Grigios at all. It’s very rare. There’s a lot of stone fruit and it really goes well with so many foods. It’s really versatile.

“Another favourite, which is only available in the UK and Canada, is Barefoot Pink Pinot Grigio. We released it last year and it has been amazingly popular.”

Barefoot has added more than £26 million in value to the UK off-trade in the past year. The entire wine category has gained just under £50 million in value, so Barefoot is a valuable brand for retailers, according to Nielsen.

“Barefoot has always taken the approach that wine should be more fun and less serious and I think this fun-loving approach to wine really speaks to a wide audience,” says Senkina, who also heads up the brand’s Asian and Middle Eastern marketing efforts. “Barefoot can be enjoyed by anyone from first-time wine drinkers to hard-core aficionados.

“We make a real effort to engage our audience through unique and relevant marketing campaigns such as our House of Sole pop up in Soho and Paws for a Cause, our campaign to find the UK’s cutest pets. Such campaigns have helped us generate over 100 million consumer impressions for the brand in 2018, with over 170,000 UK consumers trying samples of our wines along the way.

“By making continuous efforts to engage with consumers, we’re able to better understand what they want from wine.”

The wine trade faces considerable challenges in the UK. Brexit is the obvious one, but an even greater obstacle could be apathy among young adults, who frequently choose to be teetotal or to drink spirits instead of wine. However, Barefoot is a brand bucking that trend by appealing to millennials with clear branding, eye-catching marketing campaigns and approachable, fruit forward wine that resonates with the 95% of consumers that are not wine experts.

When asked how Barefoot might be able to maintain its meteoric rise, Senkina says: “To sustain growth it is important to ensure you stay up to date with consumer trends and habits, making sure you’re catering to these with your products and approach to marketing

“With consumers spending more and more time on their digital devices, we have evolved our marketing approach to be more tailored to reach our target audiences via their digital devices as we showcase our new products or other fun content such as creative serving suggestions through channels such as Facebook and Instagram, as well as YouTube. One key example of this is our #BareYourSole campaign, which generated over 75million consumer impressions via online platforms, helping us to connect with fans of the brand and potential customers alike.

“There are a number of things that the trade can do such as thinking about making wine more accessible and convenient for our more ethically savvy younger generation, as well as educating the older generation.

“Above all, the trade must make sure it’s engaging with younger generations: this could be through exciting and relevant media partners, digital channels, or unique events.”

A continual pipeline of innovation is key to a brand’s ability to stand out and continue thriving in the competitive and crowded UK wine category. We asked Wall and Senkina about this, and they promised plenty of new releases in the year ahead.

“Barefoot’s unparalleled commitment to innovation has been instrumental to its success, both in terms of new product developments and eye-catching marketing campaigns,” says Senkina. “Innovation keeps customers invested, excited and engaged, not just with individual brands but also in wine as a whole. The market needs to make sure that it speaks to a broad range of consumers in terms they understand and through methods that generate enthusiasm for wine as a whole. 2019 will be an exciting year for Barefoot with several new launches so watch this space.”

Wall is a firm believer in treating young adults with respect, regardless of how they choose to enjoy their wine.

“It’s important to be nimble,” she says. “We are big believers in listening to our foot fans. The young people coming into a legal drinking age are more flexible in their alcoholic beverage choices. Some drink wine one night, beer the next and spirits the next. We need to be flexible in how we innovate. That’s why we launched our Pink Pinot Grigio, in response to listening to the consumer.

“It’s important to encourage people to enjoy the wines the way they want to, not the way society thinks they should. We are happy for them have Champagne in a tumbler, ice cubes in rosé and wine cocktails. The more inclusive and the less judgmental you are, the more people will be encouraged to enter the wine category.

“We want to make sure we are always offering wines that bring people into the category and break the barriers. They are often sweeter wines like Moscato. These bring more people into the category than any other type of wine. They will then eventually migrate.

“We are consistently innovating. You will see at least 19 new releases in 2019. We also have unique wines for Europe that aren’t sold in the US. Foot fans in that region like a more sessionable, lower alcohol product, so we responded and made wines that are lighter and more vibrant. We are responding overall and by region as well with innovation and we have lots of new releases in the pipeline.”

Fractionals have also helped drive growth for Barefoot as it strives to appeal to convenience shoppers in the UK. “Another key behavioural change we are seeing in consumers is a switch towards shopping for tonight as opposed to doing a larger weekly shop,” says Senkina. “With this in mind, we are focusing on making sure our wines are widely available in convenience and impulse channels. We are also increasing our marketing support to drive awareness of our 187ml range for Barefoot to better cater for those consumers who are buying for tonight and so are preferring single serve formats over a full bottle of wine.”

When asked how it is planning to overcome any challenges arising as a result of the rise in duty and the uncertainty over Brexit and exchange rates, Senkina offers a typically upbeat response.

“It’s really important in times like this to emphasise brand loyalty so that consumers will not be put off by any future price changes,” she says. “As mentioned earlier, with Barefoot we invest in building strong brand loyalty with the consumer and this has helped us sustain strong brand growth in a category that is relatively flat. We plan to continue to invest in exciting and innovative marketing campaigns in the new year to continue to maintain our base of loyal consumers and add to it.”

Gallo’s advice for retailers to help them grow wine sales in the year ahead:
• Keep an eye out for consumer trends – listening to what your consumer wants and what they are excited by is hugely important. Make sure you are catering to the latest trends in order to ensure that you have the best and most up to date range as possible, as trends in the wine category are constantly evolving. For example, Malbec is currently the fastest growing grape varietal (up 21% by revenue) in the UK’s top 10 grape types and Barefoot’s Malbec is the second largest Malbec in the UK and is growing by 84%, making it a must stock after launching just two years ago.
• Identify high traffic areas or hot spots in your store that will give new or seasonal products heightened visibility.
• Ensure that well-known brands that consumers, such as Barefoot, are stocked at eye-line or in easy to find locations, as customers will come into stores looking for wines that they know and trust as opposed to more risky unknown options.

For more than 40 years, Neil Ellis himself has sought out and farmed the best places suited to his favourite grape varieties. The Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinotage come from the Jonkershoek Valley and the Bottelary Hills outside Stellenbosch and the Grenache from the Piekenierskloof, about two hours north of Cape Town. The Sauvignon Blanc, Syrah and Chardonnay come from the cool coastal sites of Groenekloof and Elgin respectively.

Neil Ellis’ children also work at the winery with eldest son Warren as winemaker and viticulturalist, Charl heads up the commercial operations and Margot the marketing.

The wines are highly influenced by classic European winemaking styles while also combining the bright fruit of the New World, with “great restraint and balance”, according to the producer.

Mark Skelton, managing director for Gonzalez Byass UK, said: “At Cape Wine in September, I was blown away by the amazing quality and consistency across the range. For me, as best winery at the show, it is quite humbling that Neil Ellis and his family should wish to work with us in this market.”

Neil Ellis said: “We firmly believe that GBUK can raise the profile of Neil Ellis in the UK and introduce our wine to a wider wine drinking public. We are joining a portfolio of like-minded premium producers and know that the team at GBUK will also be great ambassadors for Neil Ellis Wines.”

Pinkster launched back in June 2013 and it has enjoyed year-on-year growth since then after picking up listings with retailers Majestic Wine, Marks & Spencer, Harvey Nichols and Selfridges.

Pink gin has exploded in popularity in the past couple of years as major brands have jumped on the bandwagon, and Pinkster wants to ensure it remains at the forefront of the trend.

Managing director Stephen Marsh said: “This successful fundraise is a fitting close to a momentous year. The fact that we were able to raise a seven-figure sum through friends and family, speaks volumes about the robustness of the business model, the strength of the product, and the opportunities ahead.

“Backers include our directors, assorted employees, existing investors, and personal connections. All have bought into the fact that we’re a pink gin pioneer with a distinctly fruity USP.

“And with industry data showing that 11% of on gin-trade gin stockists carry a pink gin and 2.2 million people are now drinking pink, there’s clear headroom for growth.”

In 2016 Pinkster set out to raise £600,000 in a crowdfunding drive and ended up with £1 million after exceeding expectations. That funded growth in the brand, and the new money will go to increasing sales reach, extending brand marketing, and boosting production.

Marsh added: “Ironically, given the subsequent explosion of pink gins, we didn’t set out to make a pink drink. After working our way through a fruit bowl all those years ago, we discovered that raspberry worked mighty well with the juniper, delivering the best flavour.

“We’re passionate about sustainability, and the inebriated raspberries left over from producing Pinkster are used in three natural by-products, Boozy Berries, Gin Jam and Pinkster Royale.

“Whilst we don't have the marketing muscle of the major brand owners, we have a premium positioning and an unswerving commitment to fresh fruit. This marks us out from the pack and underpins our recent creative campaign, The Dos and Don’ts of Pink Gin.

“Our mantra is to focus on the flavour rather than the just colour. In other words, there’s much more to choosing a gin than its wow factor on Instagram.”

Earlier this year, former Diageo channel director Martijn van Buuren joined Pinkster as sales director. He completes the four-strong management team alongside Marsh, marketing director Will Holt, marketing director and finance director Georgina Northen.

The deal will see ABInbev purchase 100% renewable electricity for its UK operations. The 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) will roll out 100 megawatts of solar power, making it the largest unsubsidised solar energy deal in UK history, according to the brewer.

ABInbev’s two main UK breweries, based in Magor, South Wales and Samlesbury, Lancashire, produce more than 17 million bottles and cans of Budweiser each week.

The new solar capacity is expected to be connected by Lightsource BP at the end of 2020 and all Budweiser sold and brewed in the UK will begin to feature a new symbol to encourage consumers to choose a beer brewed with 100% renewable electricity.

The move reinforces the brewer’s global 2025 Sustainability Goals, which includes the target of a 25% reduction to carbon emissions across its full global value chain against a 2017 baseline.

Jason Warner, Zone President for Europe at ABInbev, said: “Beer has been bringing people together for 3,000 years and we want to ensure that people can continue to enjoy it for generations to come, which is why we’re committed to brewing the highest-quality beer sustainably.

“This deal is about driving positive change in what people buy in their weekly shop, order in the pub or drink with friends. We want to build a movement towards celebrating and growing renewable electricity, and are asking our consumers, customers, colleagues, business partners and fellow companies to join us – we are making our 100% renewable electricity symbol available for any brands who share these values.”

Nick Boyle, Group CEO at Lightsource BP, said: “Solar is cost-competitive, scalable, reliable and quick to deploy. Our partnership with ABInbev is further proof that solar power can now be delivered at a cost-competitive price. This deal will help transform the energy mix for one of the UK’s biggest brewers, contributing to the overall share of renewables production across the UK.”

“We have reached a pivotal point in the UK energy sector where unsubsidised solar is going to truly make its mark as the cheapest form of energy generation, even compared to wind. We are proud to be at the forefront of this transition with ABInbev, demonstrating that solar makes an ideal partner for corporate power.”

Off-Piste Wines has revealed plans to expand its Most Wanted Wines sparkling range in 2019, following “a great year” for the brand in the off-trade.

The Cheltenham-based producer plans to launch a Most Wanted Sparkling Pinot Grigio in 75cl bottles next year, with an exclusive listing in Co-op stores from February 2019. The newcomer is being introduced as a result of strong sales and listings this year for Off-Piste's single-serve cans of Most Wanted Pinot Grigio and Most Wanted Pink Pinot Grigio Fizz. It has also recently launched a premium Prosecco.

Off-Piste said it had recorded to strong volume sales across the full Most Wanted Wines portfolio in 2018 across the UK off-trade and export markets, bolstered by new listings in Tesco, Sainsbury’s, M&S, One Stop, Co-op and other convenience and wholesale customers.

In 2018 it also launched four new Most Wanted varietals: Chardonnay and Shiraz from South Australia, Zinfandel from California’s Lodi region and most recently Primitivo from Puglia, all of which are now available in the multiple off-trade.

Off-Piste said it also invested heavily in marketing activity for Most Wanted in 2018, with a focus on enhancing consumer brand awareness. Over the summer the company focused on outdoor events, including sponsorship of Classic Ibiza concerts in association with Ministry of Sound, the Lakefest music festival, Manchester ArtBattle and a summer-long residency at Shoreditch-based Urban Food Fest street food market. The season ended with two key consumer shows: Stylist Live and the BBC Good Food Show, showcasing the full range of wines and formats.

Brand manager, Rachel Archer, said: “Following the launch of the Most Wanted Fizz cans in 2017, we were keen to take the brand out on the road at different types of events. We knew that the cans were a great product for festivals and outdoor events but it has been invaluable to speak to consumers first hand and understand their thoughts about the cans and alternative packaging in general. Our presence at Stylist Live and the BBC Good Food Show has proved the perfect opportunity to be able to show the whole range under one roof.”

Gin sales in the UK this year reached almost £2 billion, which is nearly double the amount sold in 2016, the year dubbed ‘Year of Gin’.

The Wine and Spirit Trade Association’s end of year market report shows a massive boost in gin sales over the summer of 2018, taking the total sales value to more than £1.9 billion.

More than 66 million bottles of gin were sold in the UK in 12 months, up 41%, equating to 19 million bottles more than the same period last year.

More gin was sold during the three months of the 2018 heatwave (almost 28 million bottles) than the summers of 2014 and 2015 combined (27 million bottles for both summers combined).

This quarter saw gin grow 53% by volume and 59% by value, compared to the same period in 2017, the largest growth by quarter on record for gin and the first time a spirit has seen growth of more than 50%.

A big driver of growth for gin can be attributed to sales of pink and flavoured gin. The latest data shows flavoured gin has driven more than half of all growth in gin in the last 12 months, despite only making up one fifth of total sales. Almost three quarters of the flavoured contribution to gin’s growth has been driven by pink gin.

Flavoured gin brought in £165 million during this time, which is up 751% on the same period last year.

Miles Beale, Chief Executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said: “Gin is once again breaking records helped by our innovative distillers who have introduced an exciting array of new flavoured, pink and more traditional gins this year.

“The popular new products combined with a fantastic long hot summer and the excitement of the World Cup has helped boost the category beyond all predictions. It was only a few months ago that we announced that gin sales at home and abroad had broken the £2 billion mark.

“Our latest Market Report shows that sales of gin in the UK alone is just shy of the £2 billion. It seems we may have been a bit premature hailing 2016 to be the ‘Year of Gin’. Just two years later we’ve almost doubled sales of gin. 2019 will have to be crowned the year when gin was in the pink.”

Warren Scott, ceo and co-founder of Quintessential Brands, commented: “It’s fantastic to see the nation’s love affair with British Gin continuing as the category diversifies. Right now, we’re seeing more interest and engagement in gin than ever from consumers – those who are new to the category as well as those more seasoned gin drinkers who want to experiment with flavoured gins or splash out on more premium gins.”

Gin is now the second most popular drink sold in the on-trade, behind vodka, overtaking whiskies and liqueurs for the first time.

Stock Spirits, the Central and Eastern European branded spirits and liqueurs business, will move its UK distribution to The Drinks Company as of January 1, 2019.

The move forms part of the company’s ambition to increase support in the UK market through a dedicated UK distributor with a complementary portfolio and deep knowledge of the UK market. It will also allow its previous distributor, Distell International, to pursue its strategy to focus solely on its own brands and the House of Angostura range.

During its partnership with Distell International, Stock Spirits’ UK market share has grown in the UK, as Distell International expanded distribution of Stock’s Polish and Italian brands into a number of new channels and established its position with several key UK customers.

Commenting on the move, Michael Kennedy, Managing Director International, Stock Spirits Group said: “I would like to thank Distell for their time and effort during our short but profitable partnership.

“They have been a very professional and committed distributor for us but after a lengthy and detailed review, we have decided together that now is the right moment to focus our efforts in a new direction in the UK. We are delighted to be teaming up with Bill Oddy at The Drinks Company and we believe that their expertise in the UK market will be the ideal way of taking our range of Polish and Italian brands to the next level. The UK is an exciting place for Polish and Italian spirits with growth of these two categories well ahead of the total market.”

Bill Oddy, Managing Director at The Drinks Company Ltd. said: “We are delighted to be part of the future for Stock International and its brand leading premium portfolio. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Distell for all the professional work in developing the brands so far in the UK market. Stock’s portfolio is a perfect fit within our business and will receive priority attention as we seek to develop the range and expand its reach into the UK market.”

Commenting on the move, Joseph Walsh, Commercial Director at Distell UK & Ireland said: “The decision to exit our agreement was taken in conjunction with Stock Spirits. Both businesses have large portfolios and have a mutual desire to focus on a smaller group of key brands. I particularly wanted to thank Michael Kennedy, International MD for Stock Spirits, for his full support and for being a pleasure to work with. We both believed that the best way to grow our respective brands would be for Stock Spirits to find a new partner for its UK distribution as we focus on our individual strategic priorities. It has been an honour representing the brands in the UK and we wish Stock Spirits a very successful future.”

Drinks Retailing News - Championing the Off-Trade since  1863.  Brought to you by Agile Media Ltd.,"02 January, 2019",http://cdn744.pressflex.net/images//18346.photo.2.jpg?m=1546423663,http://drinksretailingnews.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/18346/Seven_Brothers_brewery_smashes_crowdfunding_target_after_Wolf_Alice_collaboration.html,"Manchester brewery Seven Brothers has completed a £500,000 crowdfunding drive after attracting investment from more than 850 craft beer fans.

The family firm has just received a major publicity boost after teaming up with Mercury Prize-winning band Wolf Alice to launch a collaboration beer called Yuk Brew.

That followed hot on the heels of a beer made in partnership with Kellogs, using Cornflakes that were either too big or too small to go into cereal to create Throw Away IPA.

All this news has helped Seven Brothers gain plenty of attention and it has smashed its crowdfunding target. That will allow it to open another beerhouse and hire more staff to spark an expansion drive across the UK.

Seven Brothers is now forecasting sales of £2.5 million in 2019, rising to £4.4 million in 2020 and more than £7 million in 2021.

“This raise is huge news for us,” said Keith McAvoy, one of the seven brothers that set up the firm. “We forecast to open eight further beerhouses by 2021 and increase our fermenting capacity to more than 100,000 litres and employ a further 100 beer professionals.”

The McAvoy brothers – Keith, Kit, Nathan, Greg, Danny, Luke and Guy – set up the firm in 2014 and the beers have gone national after picking up a listing with The Co-op. The seven brothers have four sisters too, and they have set up a distilling business called Four Sisters. They have brought in Keith Webb, former managing director at Bargain Booze, to help grow the business, and he sees great potential for it.

The Wolf Alice collaboration is a major coup for the brothers, as the band is currently flavour of the month following its Mercury Prize victory, which saw it beat Noel Gallagher, Lily Allen and Arctic Monkeys among others.

Yuk Brew takes its name from the name from Yuk Foo, a popular track on the band’s prize-winning album, Visions of a Life.

Wolf Alice often gigs in Manchester and the team at Seven Brothers invited them to visit the brewery. Drummer Joel dropped by in June 2018 after supporting the Foo Fighters and he was so impressed that he suggested a Wolf Alice brew.

“The band put us in touch with their management and, around their packed tour itinerary, we managed to get a meeting arranged in September in their management’s offices in London,” said Keith McAvoy. “A few samples later, and interrogating what they liked, which turned out to be lager, and their preferred brands, Keith Webb and I headed back up north to discuss with brewers Greg and Jack.

“After a bit off trialling we came up with a Vienna-style lager and the band visited the brewery in October for a tasting session. That went well, so we were off, on a race to get everything done for the band’s three big gigs in December. The band members selected the name and delivered the iconic branding alongside it.

“It has been great to work with such a talented group and we are really looking forward to selling the product into the wider market in the coming years.”

Initially Yuk Brew is produced in kegs and 44cl cans. “We believe it is perfectly suited to student areas and music clubs and venues and we will be adding it to our portfolio from January,” said Keith McAvoy.

Webb added: “The craft beer market continues its upwards trajectory, but it still represents a relatively small part of the beermarket at 5-6%.

“Maintaining that growth will be dependent on the producers producing consistently excellent brews that satisfy the craft beer curious as well the aficionados.

“The Seven Brothers Brewery has staying power in a packed market, with a best-selling core range of seven beers and a rolling programme of collaborations with brewers such as Electric Bear and Brewdog in Manchester.

“The beer and music industries are, of course, symbiotic. Over the years there have been a number of beer and band link ups but the Seven Brothers link up with Brit and Grammy nominated Wolf Alice delivers a new level of opportunity.

“Wolf Alice are the 2018 Mercury Prize winning London band, who also won this year’s Q Magazine Best Live Act accolade. One of the tracks from the Mercury winning album Visions of a Life is Yuk Foo and the band selected Yuk Brew as their lager’s name. Instantly recognisable to the band’s fans the name will grab the attention of everyone who sees it. The brew made its debut at the band’s three huge end of year gigs, one in Manchester and two at the O2 Brixton Academy.

“Wolf Alice spent the few days before the gig and launch ramping up the excitement around their lager. There were the 672 cans at the Manchester gig and they sold out in less than an hour.

“Yuk Brew has launched incredibly well and we are looking forward to engaging with the wider trade in the New Year. Most band and beer collaborations are one-off vanity pieces but ours and Wolf Alice’s is a legally constituted long term one so we’re all in it for the long term.”

Peroni Libera 0.0% was launched in Tesco stores this month and it will now be rolled out across the on and off-trades.

The brew was created using a customised fermentation process, allowing the liquid to attain a fast-ending 0.0% alcohol beer.

The drink is triple-hopped and has been brewed with the same signature Nostrano dell-Isola maize used in the parent brand.

A dedicated yeast strain has also been used to produce rich and intense citrusy aromas and hoppy notes.

Simone Caporale, the brand’s master of mixology, said: “We have seen a change in consumers’ drinking habits in the industry, with a rise of mindfulness and wellbeing people are more regularly considering low and no-alcohol drinks alternatives and currently there isn’t a premium, great tasting beer out there for them to enjoy.

“Peroni Libera 0.0% is the perfect alcohol-free beer option for the lower-tempo occasions – a mid-week night out with friends or during those working lunch occasions.

“Peroni Libera 0.0% delivers a crisp taste, a fine bitterness and a fast and clean finish, with a well-defined taste of beer, meaning those looking for an alternative to alcohol no longer have to compromise on quality or taste. Salute!”

The newcomer is priced at £5 for 4x33cl bottles.

Arbikie’s Highland Rye Single Grain Scotch Whisky was laid down in 2015 and uses a combination of Arantes Rye, Odyssey Malted Barley and Viscount Wheat. The whisky, owned and distilled by the Stirling brothers in Lunan Bay near Arbroath, is made from crops grown on the farm.

John Stirling, director, said: “We are absolutely thrilled to launch Scotland’s first Rye Whisky in more than 100 years. Records show a distillery at Arbikie in 1794; a time when they would have only used crops grown on the family farm. We are bringing this tradition back to Scotch Whisky with provenance, terroir and traceability of ingredients at the heart of everything we do. Growing rye requires long periods of dry weather, which can be challenging, however our farm team has done an excellent job.

“Whatever we have produced over the years, from potatoes to vodka, our values of sustainability, innovation and quality have been the foundation, and our Highland Rye Whisky embodies everything our family has been doing since we started farming 400 years ago.”

The Rye Whisky has been matured in first-fill charred American Oak casks and finished in Pedro Ximenez casks with no colouring and no chill filration.

Master distiller, Kirsty Black, said: “We’ve been working on our Highland Rye for years and it has posed some challenges from a growing and distillation point of view. The flavour profile is orange marmalade, cloves and maple syrup. The main differences between our Highland Rye and American Rye is that traditionally American Rye uses corn in their mash bill, and usually malted rye. At Arbikie we have used unmalted rye, malted barley and wheat. The ageing process is also significantly different due to temperatures in the US and Scotland respectively.”

The Rye will be stocked at Harrods and other luxury retailers. Only 998 bottles will be available globally.",Arbikie introduces Scotland's first Rye Whisky in 100 years

Eight distilleries have joined forces to introduce a new Whisky festival in the Scottish Highlands, while at the same time a Highland Malt Scotch Whisky brand has revealed plans for a limited-edition launch.

The Highland Whisky Festival, which will take place in May 10-17, 2019, is designed to be a celebration of the region’s finest distilleries on the North Coast 500 route. Each distillery will host an open day with exclusive events and tastings.

The eight distilleries: Balblair, Clynelish, Glenmorangie, Old Pulteney, The Dalmore, The Singleton of Glen Ord, Tomatin and Wolfburn, will each host visitors from around the world to showcase the centuries of tradition, process and craft of their home.

Festival coordinator, Katie Waugh, said: “Building on the successes of both the Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival and Islay Whisky Festival and with the continuing increase in Whisky tourism especially along the North Coast 500 we identified an opportunity for the Highland Distilleries to have a festival of their own. Between the eight distilleries we have over 1000 years of craftsmanship and experience in producing whisky. What differentiates Highland Distilleries is that they are spread far and wide along the North Coast 500. The effort of travelling is rewarded not only by world class whiskies but stunning landscapes and the warm welcoming Highland hospitality.”

The North Coast 500 added £9 million worth of revenue to the region alone, with an additional 29,000 visitors between 2016 and 2017. Scotland saw a record number of 1.9 million visits to distilleries and a spend of £60.9 million.

The programme is made up of eight unique days, each hosted by one of the participating distilleries.

VisitScotland is supporting the Highland Whisky Festival. Its regional leadership director, Chris Taylor, said: “Whisky is one of Scotland’s most valuable commodities, attracting visitors from all over the world, with one in five visitors making a trip to a whisky distillery during their stay.

“As one of the largest whisky producing regions in Scotland, the Highlands is a veritable paradise for lovers of a wee dram with whisky a vital part of local tourism. With all eyes on the Highlands and Islands next year – following Lonely Planet naming it Best in Travel 2019 – this new festival will be a great addition to the visitor experience and shine a spotlight on the area’s links to our iconic national drink.”

Separately, Douglas Laing & Co is unveiling a limited-edition line extension: Timorous Beastie 12 Years Old at Cask Strength.

The new Timorous Beastie variant is bottled at 54.4% and it is packaged in a premium gift tube.

The newcomer will have marketing activity around Burns Night as well as whisky-paired dinners in several of the brand’s key markets.

Cara Laing, director of whisky at the family-owned whisky firm, Douglas Laing & Co, said: “It feels particularly fitting to launch this special bottling of Timorous Beastie in January, the month in which we will celebrate Burns Night in honour of our national bard. Proudly bottled at natural cask strength, this feisty special edition bursts with barley, sugary marshmallow and citrus notes, and unlike its namesake, Burns’ timid field mouse. It is certainly not for the faint-hearted.

“Incidentally, it is also ‘National Cheese Lovers’ Day’ on January 20, and this special edition bottling is the perfect partner to a cheeseboard, in particular a hard cheese such as comte.”

Just 3,000 bottles of Timorous Beastie 12 Years Old Cask Strength Limited Edition will be available from specialist spirits retailers across Europe and Asia. It is expected to retail at £59.99.

It claims it is the lowest-calorie 4% abv drink on the market, and it comes in two flavours, mandarin and lime.

It is fermented from apple juice, which breaks down the naturally occurring sugars into alcohol, providing a naturally low-calorie base. A hint of cane sugar and natural fruit flavours are then added after fermentation to enhance the taste.

“Move aside vodka, lime and soda. Balans is refreshing, light in taste, and is currently the lowest calorie 4% ABV drink available in its current 25cl serve.

“With Balans, we’re helping consumers say no to ‘maybe next time’ and yes to embracing 2019.”

From March 1, Gaja will join the Hatch portfolio with wines from the three estates: Gaja, Ca’Marcanda and Pieve Santa Restituta.

The Gaja family has been producing Barbaresco and Barolo wines since 1859, and the current owner, Angelo Gaja, has combined his respect for the traditional with bold innovations in the vineyards and the cellar.

In the last 25 years the Gaja family has invested in Tuscany, taking over the PIeve Santa Restituta winery in Montalcino in 1994 and creating the Ca’Marcanda estate in Bolgheri in 1996.

Patrick McGrath MW, Hatch Mansfield MD, said: “We are absolutely delighted to represent the Gaja family estates in the UK, our first Italian producer. It is a very exciting time for Hatch Mansfield. Gaja has been at the forefront of revolutionising the Italian wine scene for many years and we are very proud to represent them and to continue building their distribution and profile in the UK. Their reputation is exceptional and they are a perfect addition to our portfolio of premium wines made by family owned businesses.”

Angelo and Gaia Gaja said: “After more than 30 great years of partnership with Armit Wines, eight years with Vinum Terra and most recently with Bibendum for the Ca’Marcanda estate, we have taken the decision to consolidate the representation of our three estates under one single importer by appointing Hatch Mansfield as our new guardians in the UK. We are very thankful for the precious efforts of our former agents who grew the presence of our wines in Great Britain.”

“We are looking forward to working with Hatch Mansfield, focusing on delivering an always higher and tailored service to the on trade and the fine wine, prestige and independent retail arena.”

BWS sales grew by 3.8% and soft drinks grew 5.8% over the 12 weeks leading up to Christmas, according to the latest Nielsen data. Other strong performing categories were confectionery (up 5.5%) and crisps and snacks (up 5.3%), while packaged grocery dropped by -1.1% and meat/fish/poultry saw sales decline by -3.4%.

Shoppers visited supermarkets more frequently this Christmas, according to the data, but sales growth slowed to just 1.8% in the last four weeks, which was almost half of the growth (3.7%) enjoyed at the same time last year.

The discounters continued to lead the way over the 12 weeks with the strongest performances recorded by both Lidl and Aldi. The former saw sales grow by 13.6% and the latter 11.7%, while in comparison Waitrose, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s all recorded a slight drop in sales over the period.

The only other retailers to post any significant growth were the Co-op (up 2.6%) and Iceland (up 3.5%), proving that convenience and value were top of the agenda for consumers last Christmas.

Mike Watkins, Nielsen’s UK head of retailer insight, said: “Growth slowed this Christmas in comparison to last. We can attribute this to several factors: consumer grocery shopping habits are changing, with shoppers now opting to spend less on doing one ‘big shop’, instead preferring more frequent, smaller trips to the supermarket, spreading the cost across multiple retailers to increase choice.

“Moreover, with over half (57%) of consumers not confident about their finances, shoppers are more budget-conscious and the various promotions and price cuts are a response to help them manage their household budget. Finally, the incremental growth continues to come from the key categories of drinks, confectionery and snacks.

“It was a reasonable but not spectacular Christmas, indicative of how shoppers will now spread their Christmas spending across more retailers and different channels.”

The range, created by owner and winemaker Samantha O’Keefe, showcases the estate’s premium offering from the cool climate terroir of Greyton, South Africa.

The Estate Reserve range (priced between £39.99 and £42.99) is a careful selection of the very best expressions of the Lismore terroir, according to the producer. The wines are produced from vines planted in shale soils over clay, dry land, farmed at a high altitude.

Hallgarten & Novum Wines portfolio director, Jim Wilson, said: “The Reserve wines from Lismore are unbelievable and we are thrilled to have them as part of our South African portfolio. We have seen first-hand the development of Sam’s wines and the awards she receives are testament to her hard work, knowledge and winemaking skill, and the Reserve range is a culmination of years of commitment to her vineyards. We can’t wait for what she has in store for us next!”

O’Keefe commented: “Having pioneered a new extreme cool-climate region in South Africa, I chose to release an Estate Reserve range to tell a very clear story of what the vineyards are capable of. The wines, from very low yielding vineyards, taste like no others grown in South Africa, which is exciting. I wanted to draw attention to the diversity that is possible in South African terroir. These barrel selections are my showcase of this very special place on earth.”

O’Keefe moved to South Africa from her home in California and said she has found “paradise and the perfect terroir” at Greyton. Vines are planted at 300 metres, and they are chilled by winter snow and nourished by the African summer sun. The result is classic, cool climate wines which are rich, complex and hand-crafted.

Hallgarten will now be able to distribute a range of wines to the off and on-trade in the UK, including Lismore Estate Reserve Chardonnay 2017, which is fermented and aged in older, neutral 300-litre barrels. The larger barrel format is believed to keep in a tight minerality and purity in the wine.

The Lismore Estate Reserve Viognier 2017 is an expression which presents flavours of dried apricot and fresh ginger; while the Lismore Estate Reserve Syrah 2017 is “an elegant, perfumed bright expression of the grape”.

The newcomers join wines from the producer in Hallgarten’s portfolio, including a Chardonnay 2016, Barrel Fermented Sauvignon Blanc 2016, Viognier ‘The Age of Grace’ 2017, Syrah 2016 and Pinot Noir 2016.

The premium German beer’s competition is open to both bar staff and consumers around the UK. Entrants are required to make a video of themselves pouring a Krombacher from a can, bottle or draught tap. They are then asked to share the video via the Krombacher Facebook Fanpage with the hashtags #Krombacher #Pourfection2019.

The entries will be marked on the quality of the pour, originality and consistency in the use of the Krombacher brand and the closing date for entries is February 28, 2019.

The winners will be announced on March 22 and they will then be flown to Germany for Krombacher’s International Party and the brewery over the weekend of April 26 to 28.

Stephan Kofler, UK & Italy sales and marketing director for Krombacher, said: “We’re delighted to relaunch our Pourfection competition for 2019 which gets bigger and receives more entries every year. It’s a great way to teach bar staff and consumers about the perfect way to pour our beer and always generate some excitement on our growing social media channels.

The AB-Inbev brand suffered a modest 1.9% sales decline in the year to December (IRI), but it still accounts for more than a third of alcohol-free beer sales.

Second placed Bavaria also saw sales drop, by 9.8%, as leading brewers launched rival brands.

Heineken 0.0, backed by a huge marketing campaign, is now the third bestselling alcohol-free beer after enjoying sales growth of 182.6% in the past year.

Another AB-Inbev brand, Budweiser Prohibition, is up to fourth after huge growth and Brewdog’s Nanny State is fifth after enjoying a 54.3% sales rise.

Marston’s Erdinger non-alcoholic beer is sixth and the same company’s Warsteiner Fresh is 10th.

Alcohol-free ale St Peter’s Without has gatecrashed the top 10 by taking eighth place, sandwiched between San Miguel 0.0 and Cobra Zero.

The dynamic category is up 33% year-on-year, according to IRI, following a strong Christmas. Kantar reported that sales of alcohol-free beer rose by £7.6 million over the 12-week period leading up to and including Christmas, while the category typically enjoys a sales spike at this time of year, suggesting that retailers should think about backing it.

Another category that Marston’s is urging buyers to champion is what it calls “crafted PBA”, featuring beers that take on the hallmarks of craft beer but are packaged in classic 50cl bottles.

“Crafted PBA is ale that sits in the 50cl PBA fixture, taking some of the design and style cues – such as IPAs with hopped flavour – from craft beer into an accessible format for non-craft drinkers,” said insight executive James Hodgkinson.

“They provide the link between more traditional PBA brands and craft ale.

“Crafted PBA is showing impressive growth of 50% over the past two years, and is appealing to a younger, more affluent demographic.

“Consumer tastes are becoming more adventurous and there is a blurring of lines between ale and craft beer.”

Bottled ale is down 0.9% in the past year, according to IRI, while canned ale is down 5.3%.

Premium bottled lager is up 10% on the back of the heatwave and World Cup in the summer, with premium canned lager ahead by 11.6%.

The three beers – a Toasted Porter, Doppelbock Winter Ale and Wee Heavy, a special scotch ale made with birch smoked barley – join the brewery’s White Ale and Pale Ale in Love Drinks’ collection.

The Einstök brewery uses the pure water from the glaciers of the Hlíðarfjall mountain and through ancient lava fields.

The brewery has been dominating market share in its homeland and is available in another 22 countries globally since its launch. The beers, which are available in 22 countries, now account around 80% of Iceland’s beer exports.

The Einstök beers are exclusively imported by Love Drinks. Marketing manager, Ellie Jones said: “For a country with a population approximately the same size of Bradford, Iceland has built a reputation for punching well above its weight. Think Vikings, renewable energy, a football team who spectacularly dumped England out of the Euros in 2016 and the Einstök brewery, who have been creating waves in the global beer market and conquering taste buds since 2010.

“In true Viking fashion the Einstök beers have made a big impression since landing in the UK so we’re delighted to extend the range with these three sensory-rich craft beers and expect them to see strong interest from the UK’s adventurous and discerning beer drinker.”

The three newcomers include the 6.7% abv Einstök Icelandic Doppelbock, which is described as a winter celebration ale. It is made using malted barley and it is described as offering “classic chocolate tones that define traditional style”.

Also in the mix is the 6% abv Icelandic Toasted Porter, which is said to have “big notes of toffee and dark chocolate” and it is roasty and rich, offering “a medium body that is robust, yet smooth on the palate”.

And completing the trio is Icelandic Wee Heavy, an 8% abv beer that takes inspiration from the Viking’s history in Scotland. The Icelandic Scotch Ale is made with locally farmed and smoked barley and spiced with native Icelandic angelica – a fabled herb ancient Vikings used as currency. It has a rich colour, creamy head, a sweet malt aroma and a hint of the smokiness delivered by the birch.

It vastly outstripped the performance it delivered during the same period in 2017, with core brands Casillero del Diablo, Trivento and Cono Sur leading the charge.

That amounted to an extra £14.4 million in sales during the 12-week trading period, leaving it ahead of Kingsland, Casella and Gallo as the supplier contributing the most value growth (Nielsen).

Concha y Toro UK general manager Simon Doyle said: “These excellent figures are very much a result of having a consistent business strategy. We are completely focused on adding value to the category by having brands that appeal to consumer needs and occasions.”

The overall off-trade still wine category grew 2.2% during the 12-week period, according to Nielsen, meaning that the supplier outperformed the market considerably.

Commercial Director Clare Griffiths added: “I’m so proud of this result for this key period, which we’ve achieved through our market-leading brands, driven by substantial and continued investment in them.”

Doyle is heading into the New Year full of positivity in spite of the challenges the wine trade faces. A duty hike will come into effect on February 1 and Brexit is scheduled for the following month, presenting the industry with a number of headaches. But Doyle is impressed by retail standards and the offering consumers are presented with, arguing that this can offset any negatives the category faces.

“Although there are challenges out there, like Brexit and duty, there’s real reason for the wine category to be optimistic,” he said. “The offering in supermarkets is as good as it has ever been, if not better. It’s still difficult to navigate, but it’s becoming better. Signage is becoming clearer and private label is much more complementary to brands. It’s helping consumers navigate varietals and origins in a very positive way. Things are looking coordinated. People just need to be encouraged to trade up.”

Encouraging consumers to trade up is a key pillar of CyT’s UK strategy and flagship brand Casillero del Diablo commands the highest price point in the top 10 off-trade wine labels. Before the strong Christmas trading period, it had grown value sales by 10% and volumes by 7.6% in the past year (Nielsen, year to November 2018), retaining an average price of £6.43 despite being caught up in retailer promotions that offer 25% off six bottle deals. For example, in the build-up to Christmas, Asda was selling six bottles of wine for £27 and the deal included Casillero del Diablo along with the likes of Yellow Tail and Campo Viejo.

“There’s a general battle going on between the grocers at these times of year,” said Doyle. “It’s the nature of the retail scene. From a brand owner’s point of view, we are not enthusiastic about it, but it’s the reality. Those are low prices when you buy six, but Casillero del Diablo is getting an average of £6.43, so that captures all those sort of deals.

“It’s a retailer’s prerogative on price and we can’t get involved in that. We make very clear with our retail partners what activities we are investing in and hope our plans are aligned with theirs. Anything lower than £6 is not sustainable, even for the medium-term.

“Casillero del Diablo is up 10% and the average retail price is holding up. We have seen a real change in the order. Yellow Tail, Barefoot and Casillero del Diablo are taking significant share from Blossom Hill and Echo Falls and Gallo. The slightly higher value wines are doing well. Flavour profiles are changing and people are prepared to pay a bit more if they know what they are going to get. Yellow Tail and Barefoot do a fantastic job, with a varietally led portfolio offering. Casillero de Diablo is seen as a more mature, slightly older profile. They complement each other quite well.

“I think it’s pretty positive, because we need to add value to this category. There’s not a lot of room for growth below £5, so it’s really important to explain to consumers that if they pay more they get more for it. With tax increases, there’s no way retailers can continue to sustain those low price points for much longer.”

Isla Negra is a major brand, with sales of £98.4 million in the past year, and CyT recently launched Californian brand 1000 Stories and a flavoured wine range called Jacked, but its focus is on Casillero del Diablo, Cono Sur and Argentinean Malbec brand Trivento. All three are showing strong growth, accounting for the UK’s number one Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Viognier and Malbec.

Doyle said the strategy going forwards is to concentrate on the off-trade. “We see a big opportunity to activate more effectively in grocery, but there’s also a massive distribution opportunity with the convenience channel,” he said. “We have a big campaign about being the number one brands in Chile and Argentina, and the number varietals in Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Pinot Noir.

“Retailers with limited shelf space have to make decisions about how many SKUs they can stock. Sometimes you see a couple of hundred SKUs with only one facing. There’s a real category job to be done there, advising independent retailers how to merchandise the fixture. They are crying out for more category knowledge. It won’t be an immediate change. It requires a partnership over time. We have a good base, but we need to give them confidence to make the changes they need to make. If they have the bestselling Australian Shiraz, Yellow Tail, why only one facing? They should have three facings. Those are the areas we need to work with them on.

“It’s their livelihoods, so they are very open to case studies. It’s a long-term commitment. We can’t just dip in and out. Rather than being distracted by the other channels, we will keep putting activations in place with the grocers and really working with the impulse channels.”

Regarding Brexit, he added: “We have to be pragmatic and agile and anticipate different scenarios. Brexit is a challenge, but there’s a limit to what we can do in practice. We just have to make sure we have a good inventory. We are bringing a lot more inventory into the UK to help offset any challenges around the March-April period.

“The duty rise is coming into play at the end of February, which is a huge frustration for wine, to be called out for very special, negative treatment by the Treasury. We have to work on that.

“The WSTA do a good job. As an industry we need to do more to demonstrate the benefits we give to UK manufacturers. We pack up a lot of wine in the Northeast of England, a region that needs a lot of investment. We need to be a bit more proactive as wine producers, working alongside the WSTA, to get these messages out more assertively than we have in the past.”

Org de Rac is an organically-certified estate in the South African wine region of Swartland. The estate was established in 2001 and in 2005 the first wines were produced from low-yielding vineyards on well-drained south facing slopes. The wines are crafted by veteran winemaker Frank Meaker, who has also overseen a shift towards completely vegan production methods.

Amathus Drinks’ first shipment includes a citrus and herb-driven Sauvignon Blanc, a Merlot, a Chardonnay and a Rhone-style Syrah. In addition, a pair of red and white blends under their Die Waghuis label have been imported.

Amathus head of wine, Jeremy Lithgow MW, said: “We are really pleased to be representing Org de Rac in the UK. We were bowled over by the quality/ value ratio of these wines when we tried them and it is particularly important to us that they are at the forefront of the South African organic movement, as this is a direction in which we are increasingly heading as a business.”

Last year Amathus added a dozen new producers to its portfolio of wine agencies. New listings from Spain, Greece, France and Japan are to be confirmed soon, according to the company.

The Borders Distillery in Hawick has launched a barley-to-bottle gin as a tribute to the town’s explorer, William Kerr.

William Kerr’s Borders Gin bears the Kerr Clan’s motto, ‘Sero Sed Serio’ (late but in earnest) on the bottle, which is a reference to The Three Stills Company’s (owners on The Borders Distillery) hand in the renaissance of distilling in the Scottish Borders after an absence of more than 180 years.

The gin has a delicate balance of several botanicals including juniper berries, angelica root, coriander seeds, liquorice root and cassia bark.

Tim Carton, co-founder of The Borders Distillery, said: “William Kerr was a man from humble origins whose love of plants helped shape the field of botany. An avid explorer and plant collector of the early 19th century, his work spanned Indonesia, China, The Philippines and Sri Lanka, resulting in him shipping more than 230 new specimens back to the UK.

“Unlike many gins we use our own spirit from beginning to end, resulting in a distinctive and delicious mouth-filling taste and texture.”

The gin, which retails at £34, will be available to the off-trade via The Three Stills Company’s distribution partner, Gordon & MacPhail Ltd.

Hawick-born William Kerr was a 19th Century botanist who was commissioned to work at the Royal Botanical Gardens Kew, London.

South Africa said that the UK remains its number one export market after the value of shipments climbed 5% to 1.84 billion rand (£102.8 million) in 2018.

That left it ahead of Germany and the Netherlands as the most lucrative international market for South African producers.

Overall the country grew exports by 4% last year and Wine of South Africa chief executive Siobhan Thompson said: “While 2018 proved to be a challenging year for the industry, we have managed to put our best foot forward and strive to continue along this trajectory.

“We have proved that we are producers of world-class, high-quality wines that deserve to have this reflected in the bottom line.”

The UK remains the leader importer of Australian wine by volume, but it is third in value after China and the US as it takes a lot of bulk shipments.

Volume exports to the UK grew 10% to 27.3 million 9-litre cases in the past year and value grew 12% to AU$389 million (£215 million).

Overall exports rose 10% in the past year for the Australian wine trade. “These figures demonstrate strong international demand and they highlight how Australian wine exporters have worked diligently to develop and maintain international markets,” said Andreas Clark, chief executive at Wine Australia. “This demand translated into growth in almost all price segments.”

He will aim to replicate the Quintessential’s UK success in key international markets, while working with the UK commercial team to build on its domestic success.

Lousada, who was chief executive at Carlsberg UK and general manager at Accolade UK, has more than 20 years’ experience in the trade.

Warren Scott, chief executive and co-founder of Quintessential Brands, said: “James’ appointment is indicative of our aspirations for Quintessential Brands Spirit Solutions.

Varieties such as Fiano, Vermentino and Nebbiolo – traditionally associated with Italy and Sicily – are seeing the strongest growth rates in Australian wine in the UK, albeit from a small base.

Wine Australia chief executive, Andreas Clark, said exports of Australian Fiano to the UK are up 30% by value, while Vermentino is up 29% and Nebbiolo 17%.

Wine Australia’s regional general manager for the UK, Laura Jewell MW, told DRN: “McLaren Vale and Adelaide Hills are producing some really interesting wines from lesser-known grapes. The conditions in Maclaren Vale are perfect for Fiano and Vermentino.”

Distributors have also noticed an interest in these wines in the UK.

He said: “Coriole was set up by an Italian family and it is celebrating its 50th year this year. We have a Fiano, Nero d’avola and Sangiovese from Coriole, produced from old vines. These wines have developed a really good reputation and we sell a lot of the Nero d’Avola in particular. The Fiano is a harder sell at £15.75 because people know they can get an Italian Fiano for £7-8. It works for indies who are able to explain to customers that this Australian version has smaller yields and the wine is more complex.”

Maggie Macpherson, Enotria’s Australia wine buyer, said: “We have Italian varieties from Australia from producers such as d’Arenberg and Chaffey Brothers Wine Co. They are making some very serious wines using Nero d’avola and Sangiovese grapes.”

Macpherson said she is also noticing a growing interest in Rhone-style wines, using grape varieties such as Grenache.

This increased diversity - and a greater awareness of Australia’s quality credentials – is helping to drive sales of wine at higher price points.

While 90% of Australian wine sales are sold below £7 per bottle, Australian premium wines are gaining momentum, with £8-9 per bottle up 23% and £9-10 per bottle up 16%.

Clark said that in the year ended December 2018, Australian wine exports to the UK (on and off-trade) increased by 12%, which is the highest value recorded since 2013.

Jewell explained that Australia has been “unashamedly focused on the premium end of the market” for the last couple of years.

She added: “This year will be my fourth annual Australia Trade Tasting event in the UK and four years ago we would have seen wines priced at £3.99 but this isn’t the case anymore. This year is very much focused on the premium end. We are also planning another trade event later in the year, specifically focused on Australia’s premium wines.

“Alternative varieties and lesser-known ones in particular, I think these are the wines that appeal to the independent wine merchants and sommeliers. They are all looking for what is new and things that are different.

“Producers who are experimenting with these varieties are also looking at longer-term projects and making sure they wait until the wines are ready to be at their best.

“So if you look at Jim Barrie’s Assyrtiko for example, he waited ten years until the vines reached maturity before the wines were ready. So it’s not just about growing quirky grapes it is about growing grapes that are suited to the climates of each region.”

Producers are looking with interest at the UK’s liqueur sector, indicating that 2019 could be the year for increased NPD in this niche drinks sector.

The news follows the announcement at the end of 2018, which showed home cocktail making is driving growth in off-trade liqueur sales.

Pernod Ricard has confirmed it is currently trialling Chili Chocolate Flavour Kahlua, which boasts “a spicy chili taste”, although the product is currently only available via Ocado (rsp: £16). The producer also has a Salted Caramel variant, which is more widely available in the UK, with stockists including Waitrose, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons.

Earlier this year By the Dutch announced it was seeking UK stockists for its eponymous Dutch liqueur, By the Dutch Advocaat. The company hopes to tap into the UK’s burgeoning cocktail scene via its UK partner, Astrum Wine Cellars.

The drink, which is produced in the Dutch province, South Holland, follows a traditional recipe using local barn eggs, sugar, brandy, vanilla from Madagascar, rosemary from Morocco and water.

Owner and founder, Jos Zonneveld, said: “It is by far the most ambitious product within the By the Dutch range. We are thrilled to see this iconic cocktail ingredient back in the speed rack.”

Also in cream liqueurs, Diageo continues to invest in NPD for its Baileys cream liqueur brand, with recent new variants including Strawberries & Cream, Almande (made using almond milk) and Pumpkin Spice.

At the end of last year, the Wine & Spirit Trade Association confirmed home cocktail making had spurred a massive surge in sales of liqueurs in the off-trade with sales of non-cream liqueurs up 56% during the 12 weeks to September 8, compared to 2017 [Nielsen]. Cream liqueur sales rose 33% to 17 million bottles.

Chief executive, Miles Beale, said: “In the past liqueurs have often been overlooked in the spirits category but the WSTA market report shows a surge in sales in the UK’s shops and supermarkets in 2018.”

In 2018 a number of distributors added liqueurs to their portfolios. Spirits specialist Tortuga added rose-petal liqueur Lanique, Vreimuth vermouth and blueberry liqueur, Mirtillo from Austrian distiller Freihof. Mangrove Global added Amaro Montenegro and Emporia Brands added Gabriel Boudier Mustard Liqueur.

Meanwhile, a raft of UK-based spirits and wine producers extended into the liqueur segment in 2018, with many gin makers adding a gin liqueur while winemakers invested in adding vermouth to their offerings.

Love Drinks is investing in the ready-to-drink (RTD) category to tap into growth at the premium end.

The company said it is “kicking off a year of innovation” with the launch of Goslings Rum Dark ‘n Stormy RTD cocktail in the UK.

The iconic Dark ‘n Stormy is Bermuda’s national drink and a trademarked cocktail, which mandates the use of Goslings Black Seal Rum.

The new 4.5% abv RTD is made using Goslings Black Seal Rum and Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer, and the 25cl cans are priced between £2-2.25 each.

Emily Gosling, Gosling Global Brand Ambassador and eighth generation family member, said: “It’s an exciting time for the rum category with increased consumer interest in the intricacies, provenance, serves and heritage behind the drink. For lovers of the Dark ‘n Stormy, or for consumers looking to discover what the rum category has to offer, this launch provides them the perfect solution.”

Ellie Jones, marketing manager at Love Drinks, said: “The Dark ‘n Stormy is a classic and much-loved rum cocktail that is synonymous with Bermuda but that is now enjoyed around the world for its simplicity, spice, flavour profile and refreshment value. Made with the same passion that has helped the 8th generation family business become one of the most-loved and recognisable rum brands in the world, I believe this new Goslings Rum Dark ‘n Stormy will provide the perfect platform for the brand to reach new consumer groups and become a big player in the exciting premium end of the RTD category.”

In recent years there has been a raft of celebrity endorsements for tequila – George Clooney, AC/DC, P-Diddy, Justin Timberlake and Santana, to name just a few – and this has all helped spread the message that a good tequila doesn’t need to be masked with salt and lime.

And alongside the celebrity-backed brands there have been a number of newcomers in the UK targeting the premium end of the market.

Dan Bolton, managing director of Hi-Spirits, says that premium products are a key driver of growth in the category, which prompted the company’s decision to launch the four-strong range of Corazon single estate tequilas last September.

“In the on-trade there is a renewed interest from bartenders and consumers in quality tequila cocktails and that translates across to the off-trade as an expectation that there will be a choice of premium tequilas available,” he says.

Bolton notes that the UK spirits sector is increasingly being driven by younger people, and these consumers are very happy to move between brands and categories as part of a spirits repertoire, including tequila, both on its own and in cocktails.

The growing interest in premium brands led the UK’s tequila market to grow by 12.2% in the off-trade in the year to August, with particularly strong growth at the top end, and in particular, from premium white tequila (Nielsen).

Nick Gillett, managing director of Mangrove UK, whose portfolio includes El Jimador and Herradura tequilas, says interest in cocktails such as Margaritas, an increase in global travel and the popularity of Mexican cuisine in the UK are all factors in tequila’s growth.

“Modern day pop-culture is also a strong influence,” he adds, “with Mexican cultural events being brought to the forefront with films like Spectre and sugar-skull pattern designs. This fuels interest in the exotic spirit category.

“But the greatest underlying factor is the significant increase in both trade and consumer knowledge of the category.”

Justin Horsman, director of Dreamweaver Brands, says there are clear indications of positive change in the tequila market but “there is still a lot of work to be done” compared to rival premium spirits categories.

“This is where brands like Pancho Datos come in,” he says, “helping the trade not only to introduce tequila to more people, but also to educate consumers to move towards an authentic or a new, more enjoyable experience.”

Dreamweaver’s Pancho Datos was launched in the UK in the second half of last year and the brand has been working hard to educate consumers on how it can be served with tonic.

Horsman adds: “A brand like Pancho Datos provides high quality 100% agave tequila options for both mixing and enjoying neat. There is no need to lower the quality just because it is in a cocktail.”

Indie Brands, the distributor of Arette and Fortaleza tequilas, also notes that premium tequila is gaining traction but that the vast majority of people still have very limited understanding of the drink.

Matt Hill, regional sales manager for London and South East England, says: “Unfortunately,

tequila is historically associated with shots, salt and lime. This is beginning to change slowly.

“With a better understanding of the category, seeking out premium options is certainly on the rise in cocktail bars, and here it is a well-respected, and often favourite, category.”

Bolton agrees that premium tequila is in growth through cocktails and sipping grades of the spirit, but points out that there will continue to be consumers who enjoy adding a slice of lime and salt to their tequila ritual.

With Corazon, Hi-Spirits sees “real potential” to broaden the market by bridging the gap between the premium end and the shots market with a wider range of mainstream serves.

Bolton says: “We are offering information about the heritage of premium tequila and the terroir of agave, tapping into that artisan spirits trend.

For retailers who want to get into premium tequila, the first thing to check is whether it a brand is made from 100% agave, as opposed to containing a high proportion of “mixtos”, which can sometimes account for 50% of a lower-grade spirit’s ingredients.

There is a global shortage of agave supplies so 100% agave styles will command a higher price.

Stocking premium brands with a strong background is another way retailers can develop a good range.

Indie Brands’ agave sales manager Paola Bridge-Collyns recommends the “bartenders’ favourite” Fortaleza, which she says is “made by the fifth generation of the Sauza family, using traditional methods from 140 years ago, offering notes of black pepper, earth and butter”. She also highlights Codigo 1530, which is new but seeing strong demand, and has five expressions.

She recommends mixing it in simple serves, such as with tonic, rose lemonade or pairing it with grapefruit soda in the Mexican way,

Mangrove managing director Nick Gillett suggests retailers think about simple off-shelf displays around key theme days. “El Jimador does a themed bottle wrap for stand out shelf presence,” he says.

Mantas Zlatkus, global brand director at Rooster Rojo tequila supplier Amber Beverage Group, says: “Ideally retailers should present the full range of all tequila and mezcal levels. While blanco is most suitable for shots and cocktails, reposado and añejo are good for sipping, or even pairing with food.”

Mezcal has a more challenging taste profile, more akin to a peaty whisky, but it can offer a point of difference for independent retailers as it isn’t widely stocked by supermarket chains.

Nick Gillett at Mangrove says: “We still view this as a fledgling category offering an artisan product – and consumer awareness is much lower.

“We offer Montelobos Mezcal, which is produced with 100% cultivated organic agave. Mezcal is an expensive spirit so we are anticipating a trend towards smaller bottle sizes to enable trial by consumers.

“It is certainly an extension of the growing trend towards tequila, so watch this space in 2019 and beyond.”

England can now boast more distilleries than Scotland, according to the latest data.

New HMRC figures show that in 2018 the UK recorded 361 distilleries, of which 166 are in England compared to 160 based in Scotland.

The gin boom has helped the number of UK distilleries to more than double in the last five years with HMRC issuing 31 new distillery licences in England compared to just 11 in Scotland.

This is a contrast to previous years where Scotland’s history of Scotch Whisky helped it lead the way. And just one year earlier, in 2017, Scotland had a total of 149 distilleries, beating England’s 135.

The WSTA’s end of year market report showed a massive boost in gin sales over the summer of 2018 taking the total UK sales value to more than £1.9 billion. More than 66 million bottles of gin were sold in the UK in 12 months, up 41% and more than 19 million more bottles than the same period last year.

Scotland does still boast some of the largest distilleries in the UK, however, an increasing number of smaller distilleries have emerged across England and Wales, with many of them diversifying and making new gins, whiskies, vodkas, rums, brandies and liqueurs.

Chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, Miles Beale, said: “It lifts the spirits to hear that distillery numbers continue to grow in the UK. It’s not just our gins picking up awards, but we have also seen a growing number of excellent quality English and Welsh whiskies too. With all the uncertainty surrounding Brexit it is extremely reassuring that our talented spirit makers are continuing to innovate, invest and grow.

""With England now boasting more distilleries than its Scottish cousins, 2018 really has marked a moment in history. There is a significant amount of money being poured back in to the British spirits industry which has been helped by the Chancellor freezing spirit duty.”

UK distillery openings have gone up 210% from 116 since 2010 when the WSTA first started collecting data – adding 245 in just eight years.

English wine and beer maker Chapel Down extended into gin and vodka making last year and in March it will open the Chapel Down Gin Works, an experiential bar, restaurant and distillery.

Chapel Down’s managing director, Mark Harvey, said: “More and more consumers want to visit the location where their products are made and be informed and entertained by the people who make it happen. There’s nothing like a hands-on experience. Our Winery visits have been a key component behind the success of Chapel Down wines – growing the congregation year on year.

""And so, following the humbling success of the launch of our new Chapel Down Bacchus Gin, it was a natural next step for us to open a distillery experience, restaurant and bar to enable us to give customers what they want. A great time! And we’re just thrilled we have landed this in the heart of a re-energised King’s Cross, the most connected place in London.”

Chief executive of the London Distillery Company, Killian O’Sullivan, said: “2018 was a tremendous year across the board for the UK spirits industry. This growth coupled with the launch of two of our whisky expressions and investment in the development of several new white spirits products has meant that we have had to launch a round of fundraising which will allow us to continue to meet the demand for British spirits both at home and overseas in the years ahead. We now produce horseradish vodka, triple sec and a liqueur in addition to our extensive range of gins and whisky.

“Growth in the gin category shows no sign of abating and we were delighted to see a number of English distilleries open in this space. Consumers continue to demand innovation across all spirit categories. Our view is that each of the new English distilleries will bring their own unique style and sense of place to the industry which in turn will drive the innovation that consumers have embraced over the last number of years.”

Warren Scott, chief executive officer of Quintessential Brands Group, owners of Thomas Dakin Gin, commented: “We’re in a golden era for quality English gin – it’s never been so popular but its origins in the North West of England are little known. The region has been an epicentre of excellence for English gin going back to the 1700’s and continues to produce some of the world’s best-selling gins at G&J Distillers in Warrington.

""There’s a growing thirst for knowledge when it comes to gin and with our new Thomas Dakin distillery, we are looking forward to breaking new ground in craft gin distilling and also to showing the world the North West’s important place in the colourful history of gin.”

The retailer has taken on Fair Vodka and Fair Café Liqueur, following a deal with premium spirits importer, Mangrove UK. The products will be available in stores and online from January 28.

Fair Vodka is made using quinoa farmed by a cooperative of 1200 famers In the Bolivian Andes. It is the world’s first Fair Trade-certified vodka, and it has also recently been certified gluten-free and suitable for vegans.

The organic Arabica coffee beans, which make Fair Café Liqueur, are harvested through a cooperative of nearly 2,000 small producers high up in Mexico’s volcanic Huatusco mountains. The sugar used is a Fair Trade cane sugar, growing in Kasinthula, Malawi by a cooperative of 300 independent farmers.

John Vine, spirits buyer, Waitrose, said: “Our consumers demand the best from us. Flavour and quality are paramount, which is why we’ve selected these brands for our stores, over and above their competitors. It’s got to taste great. But, we want to offer this quality and taste combined with ethical sourcing and sustainable production methods.”

Waitrose has also confirmed it will also be listing the Aluna Coconut rum brand from Mangrove in 245 of its stores. The rum contains 30% less sugar than its nearest competitor, according to Mangrove, and it is produced using natural coconut water and virgin sugar cane honey.

Nick Gillett, managing director, Mangrove UK, added: “Fair Vodka and Café Liqueur combine perfectly to make the hugely popular, a Expresso Martini, injecting a fun element for consumers.

""Aluna Coconut meanwhile is a flavourful gold award winner at the 2018 World Rum Awards, made with only a fraction of the sugar of other rums, which we anticipate will be a hit with Waitrose’s health conscious customers. Look out for exciting brand activation in-store in the coming weeks supporting customer education on how best to enjoy these products in their own home.”

Fair Vodka will be stocked in 270 Waitrose stores (76% of the retailer’s total estate) and Fair Café Liqueur will be in 164 stores.

Moment Karibien, which is finally aged in rum casks from Barbados and Jamaica, is described as a “spicy and fruity whisky”.

The drink is a long-awaited follow-up to the seasonal whisky, Mackmyra Vinterdrom, which was launched in Autumn 2017.

Angela D’Orazio, master blender at Mackmyra, and Alexandre Gabriel, the founder and cellarmaster of Plantations Rum, collaborated to create the final blend.

D’Orazio said: “We are absolutely delighted and proud of the long-term working relationship with Alexandre and Plantation Rum, which we began four years ago. Together, we develop new ideas and unique combinations of flavours for both whisky and rum. Moment Karibien may be one of the best ideas we have had so far.”

Around 75% of this edition has been finally aged in casks previously used to mature Plantation’s Barbados and Jamaican Rum. Moment Karibien also features small amounts of whisky aged in barrels formerly used for oloroso and cherry wine. The different casks used to age this whisky are between eight and twelve years old.

Gabriel said: “What started out as a simple exchange of barrels has now developed into something much more; the start of a genuine friendship between Maison Ferrand and Mackmyra encompassing the exchange of ideas, creativity and innovation. Barrel Swap is a programme in which we exchange barrels with producers we admire. Each new version is an adventure for us, a collation of savour-faire in creating new expressions for our rum.

""We are extremely proud of our seven-year-old Barbados Single Cask Rum – recently launched at Systembolaget – which is matured in Mackmyra’s Moment casks, and we are just as proud that Mackmyra is now introducing whisky that has been finally aged in our fine rum barrels.”

The taste of Moment Karibien is described as “spicy and fruity, with warm notes of rum, oloroso and oaky vanilla”.

Exhibitors have often complained in recent years of paying for stands and then seeing their competitors – who are not exhibiting – swoop in and conduct meetings with buyers at the venue.

Hannah Tovey, head of the London Wine Fair, said: “The decision to charge a small section of visitors is something we have considered very carefully, and we feel it is the right thing to do.

“We have listened to our exhibitors – particularly the UK agents – who feel their significant investment in the show is being undermined when other non-exhibiting agents subsequently attend, often en-masse and with the specific intention of doing business or benefitting from the valuable, high-level networking opportunities.

“I want to stress that all members of the trade are welcome, and we are not introducing this charge as a deterrent; rather it is about protecting our exhibitors and their investment and underlining the inherent value of attending the show.

“In the context of rising venue and supplier costs it represents the most even-handed way to continue with a more sustainable and equitable LWF for the whole trade to benefit from. UK importers or agents not exhibiting but legitimately attending in a buying capacity, will be most welcome and offered a free pass as our guests.

“As a corporate partner of The Benevolent we are delighted to have agreed with them that 10% of all ticket revenue will be donated to the charity as part of our ongoing partnership with this vital industry life line.”

A professor of public health has served up an early contender for the much coveted Most Preposterous Attack on the Drinks Industry 2019 award.

Simon Moore of Cardiff University teamed up with counterparts at Oxford University to compare alcohol's benefits with issues like risk of depression, insomnia and cognitive decline.

He then put out a press release saying that every bottle of wine you drink per week ends up costing you £2,400 a year.

Details are sketchy as to why these researches think it costs £2,400 a year, as they simply state “in damage to health and quality of life”.

A sum of £2,400 a year equates to £46.15 per bottle, which is pretty darn expensive when you consider the average price of a bottle of wine in the UK is £5.76.

A bottle of wine per week leaves you well within the Chief Medical Officer’s widely derided weekly recommendation of consuming no more than 14 units.

Yet these researchers claim that long-term damage to health, mental ability and relationships far outweigh any benefits of drinking wine.

They added that pint of beer a week is equivalent to £610 a year, so anyone drinking 10 pints apparently loses £6,100. Drink five bottles of wine a week and you will be down £12,000 a year, according to the researchers, which is almost half the UK average salary.

Rather than laughing off this lunacy, The Sunday Times gave it a prime spot in its fine organ, and The Mirror then published it too.

John Timothy, chief executive at the Portman Group, seemingly kept a straight face as he said: “Some people turn to alcohol to help them manage the stresses and strains of the modern world. Alcohol isn’t the cause of their anxiety and ill-health but a reaction to it.”

But Moore said: “Alcohol costs us in all kinds of ways. Regular drinking reduces our health, happiness, employability and our ability to think and remember. It also raises the risk of cancer and of assault.”

The team said it analysed the health, wealth and lifestyle of 141,000 British drinkers aged 37-73 before coming to its conclusion.

“The industry has sold [alcohol] like it’s a medicine, convincing people that it will make them happy,” added Moore. “In the end, though, it’s all alcohol and it damages your brain, body and relationships, whatever drink it comes from. Our research estimates the actual value of that damage.”

Yet the article was given short shrift by Sunday Times readers in the comments section underneath.

“I’m baffled by this bizarrely fact-free article,” said Kate Francis. “If I drink a bottle of wine a week it will cost me around £260 since my local Tesco does a very nice Beaujolais for a fiver. So how is the rest of this ‘cost’ calculated? How on earth can the editors of a newspaper which was once the ‘journal of record’ possibly have decided to print this nonsense?”

Another commenter gleefully pointed out: “You need to take into account the nibbles – responsible people eat when they drink!”

Clive Atkinson added: “On this calculation, over my 40 year working life I have had a net income of around £3,000 p.a. Having started with nothing and inherited very little I find it astounding that this small income has funded owning Maseratis, Lotuses, Range Rovers and horses that have qualified for the Horse of the Year Show on several occasions. Perhaps the consumption of a bottle or two of a decent single malt per week has a balancing effect.”

Walter Ford said “I hope they’re paying their wine correspondent enough”, although there was no response from Will Lyons, who may have been asking for a raise.

Chris Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: “This research, such as it is, is unpublished and there’s no way of knowing the methodology, so it comes down to whether you trust the researchers.

“The only researcher named in the article is Simon Moore. We came across Simon last year when he was responsible for headlines like ‘half a glass of wine can raise the risk of dementia’.

“The study claimed that drinking more than one unit of alcohol (half a pint of bitter) reduces cognitive function and therefore (it was questionably assumed) increases the risk of dementia.

“It shows reaction times. Look at the weird x-axis. Also look at the difference in reaction times, which was tiny.

“As David Spiegelhalter said at the time, ‘the authors’ conclusions are bizarre, to say the least”. Reaction times were faster at two units a day than at one a day and even the heaviest drinkers had faster reaction times than the lightest drinkers.

“There is plenty of evidence that moderate drinking reduces dementia risk. The reality is that half a glass of wine and more is beneficial.

“Spiegelhalter is a very polite man so when he says ‘it would seem inappropriate that this paper, as it stands, is part of the scientific literature’, we should pay attention.

“Since Moore grossly misrepresented the risks of drinking in that study, there is no reason to trust his back-of-a-fag-packet, unpublished cost-benefit analysis.

“I’d sooner judge the research by reading the study rather than looking at his track record but if you’re going to bypass journals and announce your findings via the Sunday Times’ worst journalist, that’s what’s going to happen.”

The watchdog set out to discover the amount of ads for alcohol, gambling and foods high in fat, salt or sugar that under-18s in Britain typically see.

It found that alcohol saw the steepest decline over the four-year period, followed by supposedly unhealthy foods at 45.5% and gambling at 37.3%, although it noted that it did not have the full picture for foods high in fat, sugar and salt.

On average British children saw 161.2 TV ads per week in 2017 and one of them is about an alcoholic drink, while 2.8 cover gambling and 9.6 focus on foods deemed to be unhealthy.

ASA chief executive Guy Parker said: “Protecting children has always been at the heart of our regulation. These findings show that in recent years, children’s exposure to TV ads for alcohol, gambling and food and soft drink products high in fat, salt or sugar is declining.

“We’re not complacent though and we’ll continue to actively monitor and report on this important area of work. Our next focus will be to examine whether the rules are working in the same way online and we’ll report on that later in 2019.”

The Glengoyne Legacy Series: Chapter One represents the first in a series of annual releases from the distillery and is the first global release since October 2017.

Chapter One represents the first in the series of unique expressions which will be released annually. These will showcase the stories of the distillery’s history and the people wo have shaped it over the past two centuries.

The first in the series reveals the story of when Glengoyne’s Distillery Manager from 1869, Cochrane Cartwright, arrived at the distillery and took the famously unhurried production process to the next level. He slowed down distillation to a third of the industry average in order to maximise the sweet, fruity flavours of the spirit. It was also under his management that sherry casks were first introduced to Glengoyne.

Chapter One boasts a rich, fruity profile with notes of toffee, warm pear, spicy cinnamon and vanilla. These flavours are derived from first fill European oak Oloroso sherry casks that have matured this whisky.

Katy Macanna, brand manager for Glengoyne, said: “Glengoyne Distillery is known for its unhurried distillation process and six year wood journey from tree to cask. The first in our new Legacy Series is a fitting tribute to Cochrane Cartwright and the vital role he played in shaping the award-winning whisky that we remain tremendously proud of today.

“We’re delighted to announce the launch of The Glengoyne Legacy Series: Chapter One, which will be available to buy throughout Glengoyne’s global markets and from our online and distillery shops from 18 February.”

The Glengoyne Legacy Series: Chapter Oe will retail at £54.99 per 70cl bottle.

The newcomer joins The Bitter Truth’s eclectic range of cocktail bitters, artisan liqueurs, blossom waters and flavoured spirits, and it is available immediately to the off-trade.

Samantha Burke, Love Drinks’ new managing director, said: ““The Bitter Truth is a hugely respected brand throughout the bar industry with its high-quality, innovative range of seasonings, syrups and spirits synonymous with the best cocktails. Following the huge success of the company’s Pink Gin last year, we expect the unique Tiki Lovers Pineapple Rum to make a similar sort of splash this summer as the weather heats up and the ‘Tiki Season’ begins in earnest.”

Tiki Lovers Pineapple Rum is made using a blend of aged and unaged Jamaican pot-still rums, 3-year old Barbados rum, aged in former Bourbon Whiskey barrels and some young column-still rums from Trinidad and Guyana. The rum-blend is then infused with pineapple extract from South America and it is allowed to rest for several weeks.

The rum, priced at £33 per bottle, is described as being “bold, vibrant and taste-rich” with both the pineapple and the rum characteristics being given space to shine. It is recommended with a mixer for tropical drinks or with ginger beer on ice.

Bancroft Wines is adding the Barossa Valley winery Glaetzer to its growing portfolio of Australian producers.

The family-owned boutique winery was founded in 1995 and it is dedicated to the production of super-premium, site-specific red wine made in small volumes.

The Glaetzer family, originally from Germany, were some of the earliest viticulturalists in the Barossa Valley and Clare Valley. Today the business is run by winemaker Ben Glaetzer and he produces wine from fruit sourced from the northern sub-region of the Barossa, including fruit from 80 to 110-year old non-grafted bush vines.

Bancroft Wines’ ceo, Jon Worsley, said: “As we expand our Australian portfolio, we are carefully seeking out producers who are the absolute benchmarks of their appellations. Glaetzer has long represented the pinnacle of terroir-driven, quality-focused Barossa winemaking, and we couldn’t be prouder to work with Ben and his team.”

Ben Glaetzer said: “We have over a 20-year proud history in the UK where we have established strong relationships, and the UK market is very important for us. Glaetzer is about to embark on a new era of growth and we are delighted to be partnering with Bancroft Wines in the UK on this journey.”

Shaw will be responsible for the global sales and marketing of beer. The brewer said the role of CEO of Beer was formed in order to provide additional senior strategic leadership as the company enters a period of accelerated growth domestically and internationally.

News of the appointment follows a successful 2018 for Brewdog. Last year the company launches The Brewdog Blueprint, a business manifesto containing more than 30 initiatives that reflect its commitment to evolving its business.

Also last year the company announced strong half-year trading results, showing total revenue at £78 million in the six months to August, up by 55% on the same period in 2017. Its UK retail sales had grown 83% over the same period.

And last October the brewery closed its fifth crowdfunding round, having secured £26.2 million over the previous 12 months.

Co-founder James Watt said: “Andy’s impressive track record for championing a strategic, global vision is what makes him such an exciting addition to the Brewdog crew. His experience in working in a vibrant, bold, business famed for pushing the envelope is exactly what we need as we enter hyperdrive on our global vision.

""Our mission remains exactly the same it was on day one; to make other people as passionate about great craft beer as we are. Andy will be pivotal in ensuring we fulfil this over the coming years.

Andy Shaw added: “Brewdog’s feats over the last decade are a direct result of a culture of innovation and fearlessness. When many in the industry doubted and scoffed, James and Martin remained clear eyed and determined to change the world of beer for the better.

”I’ve been impressed by them for the last ten years and I simply could not pass up the opportunity to join such a dynamic team in the next phase of growth.

Many congratulations to all of our winners and our finalists.

Retail standards have arguably never been higher when it comes to BWS and that has ensured that our readers have largely remained profitable in an era of increasing moderation among consumers.

Analysing this broad and dynamic industry and devising a shortlist of the very best retailers in the business in each category is a mammoth task, particuarly as we received a record number of entries this year, and we have dedicated a great deal of resource to it in order to get it right. We feel our judging process is robust and therefore the shortlist is truly representative of the best in the business.

Our team has been out and about across the UK, from Goring to Gateshead, conducting store visits at a host of brilliant independent retailers. We also went to several branches of all the multiples, assessing them on range, sourcing, appearance, retail standards, merchandising, marketing, in-store communication, promotion, innovation, staff knowledge, customer engagement and business success. We have also been spending a lot of time online, accompanied by ecommerce experts, analysing retailers’ strengths and weaknesses in the digital sphere.

This is also bolstered by Nielsen retailer sales data, a strong indicator of who is growing market share and who is driving value into the market. We also worked with YouGov to poll 2,000 consumers on which retailers are excelling with their BWS offerings. To be nominated for a Drinks Retailing Award is a tremendous achievement, and to win one is a stamp of the ultimate quality.

Since the 1970s the company has doubled its estate and replanted 85% of its old vines, investing in Verdicchio and Rosso Conero areas as well as extending to other indigenous varieties such as Pecorino and Lacrima di Morro d’Alba.

Alex Hunt MW, purchasing director at Berkmann Wine Cellars, commented: “We are truly honoured that Umani Ronchi have decided to appoint Berkmann Wine Cellars as their UK distributor. This partnership arises from a real meeting of minds, with two family businesses founded in the middle of the twentieth century looking to forge a successful and sustainable future together in the twenty-first.

Pernod recorded an 11% growth in profits for the six months to December 31, 2018.

Growth was driven by double-digit increases across its Asian markets, especially China and India, while the Americas also saw a 4% rise in sales.

In the UK sales declined because the company said it adopted a ""value-based approach"" for Jacob’s Creek with a focus on the brand’s higher-end styles, and it implemented less promotional activity on Campo Viejo.

Despite this, the UK arm of the company out-performed the spirits market with double-digit sell out, and particularly strong performances on gin, aided by a “very successful” launch of Beefeater Pink. Jameson also performed well, the company said.

And globally, Beefeater Gin grew 9% with a strong performance across all regions. Beefeater Pink, which was launched in April 2018, helped drive this growth, particularly in the UK market.

Martell, Jameson, Scotch and Gin all performed well on a global basis while strategic local brands such as Seagram’s Indian whiskies were also highlighted by the company.

Award-winning drinks design agency BD Creative has been renamed as Barlow & Co as it celebrates its 21st birthday. Abigail Barlow set up the firm back in 1998 and it has since worked with leading retailers including Asda and Spar, large global brands such as McGuigan and boutique producers like Jenkyn Place in Hampshire. We caught up with Barlow to find out her reflections on the past 21 years, her vision for the future and her advice for retailers bidding to create an exciting and visibly appealing wine range.

Why did you change the name and refresh the branding of your company?

In our ever-evolving industry, any brand that stands still and does not move with the times risks becoming irrelevant and getting left behind. We recognised the need for an identity that better communicated exactly who we are and what we do. I bring 30-plus years of wine and drinks trade experience to my company, but it’s not just about me. Everything we do is a collaboration: both within our team and more importantly, with our clients. This going beyond the label really is our USP. Barlow & Co – think of it as ‘co’ for collaboration and ‘co’ for our company teamwork.

How has wine design evolved over the past 21 years?

Back in 1998 it was the beginning of exclusive labels, which were created by us in the UK, specifically for UK customers – namely the grocers – with tailored design for the trade and buyers and delivered by us. It allowed scope for creativity and exploration away from brands, which were more traditional in style. It also created the right environment for us to create the successful Pendulum [the chrome sprayed bottle], which sold over 1 million units at its peak through Western Wines.

In terms of design style, 21 years ago we were looking to move away from traditional labels – vineyard scene, lots of text, script fonts, seals, etc. Everyone wanted modern, simple and fresh. Now of course we are seeing a big push back to craft, and this is expressed through reconnecting with the producers, provenance and history, although this time we are doing it with a contemporary twist. So we are connecting with our roots and re-working it for the 21st century.

What are the challenges faced in trying to gain shelf standout for wine?

The curve of the bottle, how the light hits the shelves, reading the brand name, communicating quickly what the wine is, looking different to competitors, what is memorable for consumers – it’s the one with the kangaroo, yellow label etc – and also the need to think about fridges for whites and ensuring the paper isn’t affected by moisture.

How does it compare to other drinks categories like beer and spirits, which seem to have more scope to innovate with bottle shapes and sizes?

There are some constraints with wine and that’s why you don’t see as much innovation with bottle shapes and sizes. Firstly margin – wine is a low margin product and doesn’t have budget like spirits to commission new bottle shapes, which are very expensive at the outset. Quite a lot of mainstream wine is bottled in the UK by two or three main bottlers and they only offer a limited range of shapes and colours. Secondly, size. We can only sell wine in certain sizes by law and this creates a constraint in itself.

Would you like to see more innovation in wine?

Yes, of course. But I do think that wine outside of entry level is the ultimate craft product and while we need innovation it doesn’t mean innovation for innovation’s sake. What I would like to see is more authenticity and diversity in design and shape. I’d like to see the walls of similar looking bottles in supermarkets be broken up and appeal to different consumer groups. Like we did with Wine Atlas at Asda. There are opportunities for engagement with different sizes and formats but these also need shelf space, and therefore need to be reassuring to consumers as they still find wine to be complex. There is so much choice and the fear of buying the wrong thing is still very much a concern.

Do you have any tips for retailers to put together a range that looks exciting and stylish?

Allow your wines to be designed differently, so you allow different consumers engage. Remember beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Don’t design by gender, design by story and look and feel. Let the wines tell their stories and let them be visually different.

Why should the trade commission you to design their drinks?

The number of bottles sold increased 28.9%, while the average price per bottle was up 26.2% to a record £337.91.

That tally was boosted by 265 bottles being sold above the £10,000 mark, a 191% rise from the 91 sold in 2017.

Andy Simpson, co-founder and director at Rare Whisky 101, which crunched the numbers, said: “The secondary market for rare whisky continues to outperform our expectations. With the average bottle price increasing by around 15% from the half-year stage to year-end, we saw a rapid acceleration of activity within the last few months of the year.

“In fact, more than £15.5 million of value was sold in the final quarter of 2018, more than double 2014’s full year performance of £7.6 million. The value increase, in particular, is due in part to the two record-breaking 1926 Macallan bottles selling in December.

“While these two bottles were among the stand-out items for sale, they were by no means the exception. Across the board, we’re seeing an increased number of valuable bottles selling for greater value than ever before resulting in phenomenal growth within the market for over £1,000 bottles.”

A cool £1 million was paid for single bottle of 1926 Macallan in 2018 and that massively boosted overall sales in this channel.

David Robertson, also director and co-founder at Rare Whisky 101, added: “While demand for rare and vintage whisky shows no signs of slowing, the fundamentals of investing in the rare whisky market remains strong.

“The UK auction market remains the biggest and most active market worldwide, and there’s nothing to suggest that will change. As consumption continues to increase, driven by connoisseurs, collectors and investors, the stocks of rare whisky will continue to diminish, creating the ideal conditions for escalating hammer prices.

“However, with the uncertainty of Brexit hanging over us, it is extremely difficult to second guess what will happen with cross border trade and access to bottles. From both a volume and value perspective, 2019 is very difficult to predict.”",Scotch whisky auction market soared in 2018

Glen’s Peach & Passionfruit and Glen’s Strawberry & Apple are made using Glen’s Vodka with fruit flavours resulting in a 20% abv drink designed to be drunk with a mixer or as a cocktail.

The drinks have been developed in response to growing market trends for complex infusions and lower-alcohol options, according to the producer.

Alisha Goodwin, Glen’s Vodka brand manager, said: “Glen’s Vodka has been the number one take home vodka brand in Scotland for many years, and has performed particularly well for independent retailers.

“The growing interest in flavoured spirits and increasing demand for lower alcohol products presented an opportunity for us to expand the range. The flavoured spirits will sit alongside our Glen’s Vodka and the more premium Glen’s Platinum.

“As we enter the spring months, we are confident Glen’s Flavours will become the brand of choice for consumers looking for a refreshing spirit. By combining quality vodka with zesty, fruity flavours we are eliminating the need to have dozens of ingredients and instead offer a simple solution for a delicious summer drink.

Camus, one of the largest family-owned Cognac producers in the world, decided to transport barrels of its finest liquid to Barbados in a classic tall ship using only the power of wind. The barrels left La Rochelle, France on November 22, 2018 and arrived in Barbados last week.

The oceanic voyage exposed the Cognac to a lengthier maturation as well as environmental factors, which will have influenced the way the liquid matured. The ship’s motion continuously shook and stirred the Cognac inside the barrel.

The Cognac has now been entrusted to Richard Seale, head of Foursquare Distillery, who, in partnership with Camus, will oversee a further year of maturation on the island.

Jean-Dominique Andreu, Camus’ chief marketing officer, said: ""Since the tall ship De Gallant departed from the port of La Rochelle on November 23 with our 10 sealed barrels of Camus cognac on board, the expedition has had its ups and downs, but there have been some really good times, and it has ended right on schedule, arriving on 10th January in Bridgetown.""

Richard Seale, director of Foursquare Rum Distillery, said: ""We are proud that the illustrious Cognac House of Camus asked us to join in this great experience. Of course, patience is paramount in our profession, but I can’t wait to taste the result in a year and a half’s time.""

The one-off experimental series, Camus Caribbean Expedition, will be limited to up to 5,000 bottles, and will be released to selected retailers in 2020.

The team will be working with Manchester-based Up North Architects to renovate six of the grade 2 star-listed railway archways. Plans for the distillery also include a bar and restaurant, where consumers can taste Manchester Gin, cocktails and produce from local artisanal producers.

Seb Heeley, co-Founder of Manchester Gin, said: “It’s been an ambition of ours, since we started in our dining room, to give people the ability to come and meet us and see how we make our beautiful gins in person. The arches under Manchester Central will be the perfect mix of the old industrial heritage of Manchester with a contemporary look synonymous with our brand.”

The venue is expected to launch in the summer, and it will also allow the producers of Manchester Gin to increase capacity with the upgrade to a new 1,000 litre still.

Shaun Hinds, Chief Executive of Manchester Central, said “Since joining the business 18 months ago, I’ve been looking for the right opportunity to activate our arches and reinvigorate this part of the venue. In getting to know Seb and Jen from Manchester Gin, I have been impressed with their vision for their business which in many ways matches the ambition of Manchester Central and the city as a whole. As an iconic feature of the city ourselves, I knew early on that this development would create a unique destination within the realm of our venue for both Manchester residents and visitors alike. We’re delighted to be part of the next chapter for this tremendous local business.”

Caleño is designed to “infuse the sunny spirit of South America” with a “zesty and tropical non-alcoholic spirit”, according to its founder, Ellie Webb, who hails from Columbia.

The drink has been created to provide an alternative to its alcoholic counterparts but also to fight the “age-old stereo-type that not drinking is boring”, according to Webb.

She said: “For so long, people who want to socialise with friends, but don’t want to drink alcohol have had to put up with being called boring, or are under peer pressure to drink. I grew up surrounded by music, dancing, and an upbeat Columbian culture. This has had a big influence on the creation of Caleño, which is here to show people that you can have fun without drinking.”

Caleño’s first variant is Juniper & Inca Berry, which is a tropical infusion of juniper, citrus and spice botanicals, steam-distilled in stainless steel drums. The key ingredient is the South American Inca berry, which is sweet and with flavours of pineapple, mango and citrus fruit.

Caleño is available to buy online via its website www.calenodrinks.com for £24.99 and it will be available in major supermarkets from March.

Drinkaware ambassadors will go into 100 Asda stores across the UK this month to educate shoppers about the pitfalls of drinking to excess.

The charity first teamed up with Asda in 2016 for a pilot scheme, and last year’s in-store education drive reached 7,000 shoppers and attracted support from a number of MPs.

This year the Drinkaware ambassadors will be giving out printed literature and encouraging customers to record their drinking levels.

The scheme will run on January 11 and January 18. In 50 stores, shoppers will be given a scratchcard, while in the other 50 ambassadors will help them to fill in the online Drinkaware DrinkCompare Calculator, which will analyse their current drinking and compare it to others in the same age group.

Drinkaware has also trained Asda community champions, as a way of taking the messages about drinking in moderation out to the wider community through their work with local groups.

Rommel Moseley, Drinkaware director of business development and partnerships, said: “Working together with Asda for the past three years has enabled Drinkaware to get out into their stores across the country and work with people face-to-face.

“The advice and information that Drinkaware provides is invaluable to the many people looking to make changes to their own or a family member’s drinking habits in January, and we know that the Drinkaware ambassadors in Asda will help many customers to make positive changes and reduce their risk of alcohol harm.”

Chris Lowe, senior director for corporate affairs at Asda, added: “We are pleased to be working with Drinkaware again this year, as part of our role as a responsible retailer, helping them to engage directly with our customers.”

Thatchers has added two West Country style ciders to its Cider Barn collection for 2019.

Thatchers 458 has been blended from the 458 varieties of apple grown in the Thatchers Exhibition Orchard at Myrtle Farm, Somerset. Thatchers Vilberie, in contrast, has been created from one single apple variety, the bittersweet Vilberie, harvested from one of Thatcher’s orchards in the foothills of the Mendip Hills.

Thatchers 458 is a well-balanced, medium dry cider and it is full-strength at 8.4% abv. It is made from the complete range of cider apple types: bittersweet, bittersharp, culinary sweet and culinary sharp. Lesser-known and ancient varieties which have been blended into Thatchers 458 include Vagon Archer, Wyken Pippin, Pigs Snout, Cider Ladies Finger, and Slack-ma-Girdle.

Richard Johnson, chief cidermaker at Thatchers describes Thatchers 458, “This is a cider that’s been created to showcase a moment in time and makes a welcome return after a few year’s break. The selection of apples – harvested over a period of three months in four separate sessions to ensure we gather them at their optimum ripeness – really offers us the periodic table of apples – from those high in tannin and acidity, to those at the sweeter end of the scale. There’s no other orchard like the Exhibition orchard, creating a truly unique cider made from the heart.”

Thatchers Vilberie, a single varietal cider from the Vilberie apple, is described as “a delicious dry 6% cider” with a “balance of rich, soft tannins and acidity”.

Johnson said: “Thatchers Vilberie is a cider brimming with tannins. It is robust and packs a strong apple punch. If you like a Malbec or a Rioja wine, then Vilberie will be the one for you. It has a rich amber colour, long dry finish and hints of chocolate and coffee in its aroma. It is a cider for the experienced cider drinker that keeps you wanting more.”

Fourth generation cidermaker, Martin Thatcher, said: “We relish bringing new ciders into our Cider Barn collection every year, showcasing the skills and expertise of our cidermakers. Thatchers Vilberie and Thatchers 458 have contrasting traditional West Country cider styles thanks both to the apples selected and the techniques used to craft them.

“With apples from our orchards all within a few miles of Myrtle Farm, blended and packaged here at our mill, these are ciders that reflect the very heart of Somerset cidermaking.”

The two newcomers are available in 50cl bottles priced at £2.05 each.

The Talisker Tasting Experience is a voice-activated skill that is designed to make the heritage of Scotch more accessible to more people than ever before.

Adults will be able to explore the colour, smell and taste of Talisker by asking Alexa to open ‘Talisker tasting’. Alexa will then ask them to name the whisky they would like to explore: Talisker Skye, Talisker Storm or Talisker 10-year-old Single Malt.

Selecting the whisky will then kick-start an audio journey that will educate them on how to taste Scotch and get to know the complexity of flavours in the Talisker range. The final stage invites the taster to ask questions about the story behind their drink, or flaovurs of Scotch they might like to try in the future.

Diageo said that in September the Baileys Almande voice activated ‘send me a sample’ campaign generated more than 6,000 sample requests in its first week of the campaign.

Diageo has also launched ‘The Bar’, for the Amazon Echo Show, which enables consumers to master mixology techniques and shop for ingredients through voice-led practical advice. The company also launched the Happy Hour Amazon Alexa Skill earlier this year, which provides cocktail recipes and recommends bars in which to enjoy a Diageo cocktail.

Benjamin Lickfett, head of technology and innovation at Diageo, said: “Talisker is a brand with an extremely rich heritage, produced by the sea on the Isle of Skye. We were looking to bring elements of this location and the fantastic tasting tours at the Talisker Distillery into people’s homes.

“Voice is the perfect technology to do just this and provide an enhanced brand experience by putting the consumer, product and brand at the centre of a tasting, in a completely seamless and non-intrusive way.

“Scotch is at the heart of our business and a product we are passionate about, but we realise that whisky can often be perceived as a complex category to access. Through the Talisker Tasting Experience Skill we’re able to bring the history and traditions associated with Scotch to a new generation of drinkers.”

The drink is described as “a high quality aperitif” made from grapes selected from various regions in southern Baden, Germany. Belsazar is infused with herbs and is finished with a dash of fruit brandy. It is then aged for up to three months, allowing it to develop complex aromas.

There are five in the range: White, Red, Dry, Rose and a limited-edition Riesling Edition. The collection has been created to be enjoyed as an aperitif, served with tonic or as part of a cocktail.

Richard Larkin, head of Diageo Reserve GB, said: “We are incredibly excited to be launching Belsazar, the first ever vermouth to join the Diageo Reserve portfolio. Vermouth is enjoying a real resurgence in popularity, boosted by a growing trend for low Abv drinks and classic cocktails. The versatility and distinctive characteristics of the liquid means it compliments a wide variety of serves, or is a great option as a quality aperitif. It really is an excellent choice for easy-to-make cocktails that can be created in the home.”

Belsazar Vermouth is available at online retailers including Ocado, Master of Malt and The Whisky Exchange, and specialist spirits shops such as Gerry’s and Amathus Drinks. It comes in 37.5cl (rsp: 15.95) or 75cl (£24.95) bottles.

The drink is created by distilling the following botanicals: juniper, cubeb pepper, cardamom, liquorice, angelica, coriander and Persian dried lime; all at its Hackney factory the Soda Works.

The Crafty Brewing Company has acquired Guildford-based brewery, The Little Beer Corporation (LBC).

Crafty Brewing, a microbrewery based in Dunsfold, Surrey, was established in 2014, and its flagship beers include Dunsfold Best, Hop Tipple IPA and Laughing Wolf. The company started out with a single 100-litre brewing vessel and it has grown over the years to become a business that serves more than 260 venues and retailers across Surrey, East and West Sussex, Hampshire and London.

LBC was set up 10 years ago by local entrepreneur, Jim Taylor. The acquisition sees Crafty Brewing take over LBC’s lease, acquire its assets and continue employment for all LBC staff members.

The purchase will also allow The Crafty Brewing Co to double its brewing capacity to 40,000 litres of beer per month. Founder and head brewer, Luke Herman, said: “This is a milestone for us and, we believe, for Guildford. The Friary Mieux brewery closed in 1969 (now the site of the Friary Shopping Centre) so Little Beer was the city’s last remaining brewer. We are thrilled to take on the mantle of rejuvenating Guildford’s proud brewing tradition. We shall start immediately.”

Looking ahead, The Crafty Brewing Co will redevelop its original brewhouse to create a new 4,000 sq ft brewery with a capacity of 100,000 litres per month. The expanded brewery is being built at Thatched House Farm near Dunsfold in the Surrey Hills.

Andrew McMorran, The Crafty Brewing Co’s chief executive office, said: “We owe our success to the loyalty of our customers in Surrey but with demand now coming from national restaurant groups, hotels and theatres we need this extra capacity in Guildford to produce more beer. We launched an apprenticeship scheme with Godalming College in February so now we have the capacity ti increase production we can recruit more local people to make, sell and deliver to new customers.”

Taylor at LBC said: “We closed Little Beer with a heavy heart. However our extraordinary beers and our former shareholders will be in excellent hands with The Crafty Beer Co and I look forward to seeing Crafty Brewing go from strength to strength.”

Lidl UK has revealed the next collection of wines to feature in its Wine Tour series.

The wines, which together will form the New World Wine Tour, will arrive in Lidl stores from January 24, 2019.

The majority of the 24 wines come from New World wine-producing nations, with Australia, Chile and South Africa particularly well represented in the collection, but there are also examples from Old World producers, including France, Italy and Germany, which have been added to help consumers explore more unusual wines from those in the core range.

Lidl UK’s wine consultant, Richard Bampfield MW, explained: “Lidl has been doing a lot of work on its New World offerings and not that long ago all it had were some wines in the Cimarosa range, but now there are other brands exclusive to Lidl, such as the Purple Heron range of South African wines and Artan from Australia; the amount of wines from New World nations has been ramped up considerably in Lidl stores over the last 18 months.

“So a lot of those wines will feature in the next Wine Tour collection, which goes into stores towards the end of January, but there will also be some wines in there from Old World wine producing nations. Really it is because the Wine Tour concept allows Lidl to explore ground that isn’t covered in the core range; it gives us the opportunity to cover those more unusual wines. So there are some grape varieties in the collection that are not exactly rare, but they are not ones that are well-known and they can’t be found everywhere in UK stores.”

Examples of lesser-known grape varieties in the New World Wine Tour include the Domaine du Grand Selve Roussanne from Pays d‘Oc, France, 2017 (rsp: £5.99), which is made from 100% Roussanne grapes; Purple Heron Grenache Blanc from Western Cape, South Africa, 2018 (rsp: £7.99), made from 100% Grenache Blanc; and Grecanico Terre Siciliane from Sicily, Italy (rsp: £5.99), made from 85% Grecanico.

Bampfield also highlighted the Campagnia region from Italy as an interesting area and one to watch for 2019.

He added: “All of the things we have tasted from Campagnia are interesting at the moment and there are so many nice wines coming out of that region, and these are from grape varieties that are not widely known. It’s an area that is attracting more interest and there are some really good examples around, not just with Lidl.”

The January Wine Tour will inc.ude one example from Campagnia, the Falanghina del Sannio (rsp: £6.99), which is made from 100% Falanghina grapes

Bampfield concluded: “This Wine Tour should give people a sense of exploration of these lesser-known grape varieties and interesting regions, which is what it is all about.”

Brought to you by Agile Media Ltd.,"17 December, 2018",http://cdn744.pressflex.net/images//18328.photo.2.jpg?m=1545045894,http://drinksretailingnews.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/18328/Tesco_BWS_director_sees_a_drinks_industry_bursting_with_opportunities.html,"Tesco BWS director Rob Cooke has challenged suppliers to bring more genuine innovation to the market in order to maintain a thriving drinks industry.

Cooke took over from Gavin Warburton in the top role at Tesco’s alcoholic drinks division back in August 2017. The retailer’s BWS team has since drawn praise from several suppliers for its ranging, merchandising and retail practices.

Sales of beer, cider, spirits and wine have been strong for Tesco over the past year, but Cooke is not resting on his laurels and he is seeking interesting products to bolster its performance.

“We get presented with a huge volume of new products,” he said. “The challenge is not so much in the amount of new product development, but the amount of genuine innovation. We need less duplication and more customer-focused and differentiated products.”

Cooke sees opportunities to drive growth in a range of different categories and he wants to foster a fun, dynamic environment for his team to learn and thrive in.

He said: “I want BWS in Tesco to be a great place to work – a brilliant learning experience and good fun too. For customers, I want to provide great products, great value and a great shopping trip. For suppliers, I want us to be the partner of choice, so they work with us because they want to, rather than need to.

“We see opportunities in pretty much every area. No/low Alcohol is clearly a focus. There are huge quality leaps being made in this category and we can now offer customers a real choice, without a taste compromise.

“I think the new product development in this area will be particularly compelling over the coming year.

“I also think we have pushed the boundaries of what customers expect from a supermarket craft beer range. This is also an area we will continue to innovate in.”

The retail industry is facing a number of challenges, but Cooke is pleased with the progress his team has made.

“I am very comfortable with the performance of all my categories, though there are obviously some hot categories, like gin and craft beer,” he said. “I am also delighted with the work done on our Tesco Finest wine range, which is going from strength to strength.”

The retailer’s Finest Barolo and Finest Amarone just won gold medals at the International Wine Challenge, and wine product development manager Charlotte Lemoine said: “It’s really important to us that the Tesco Finest wines deliver, not only in terms of taste and quality, but also that they are authentic expressions of their terroir and style. This is particularly important for the well-loved classics in the range, a category that the Barolo and Amarone definitely fall into.

“As special occasion wines – not to mention Italian icons – there’s added pressure to ensure they live up to the big names on the label. We were confident that these wines did just that, but it’s absolutely fantastic to have received this recognition of their quality from the IWC.”

When asked for his highlights over the past 16 months, Cooke added: “I am extremely proud to have been able to work with such a passionate and driven team, who genuinely go the extra mile for customers every day. They have responded brilliantly to the strategy changes we have made and have delivered above and beyond expectations.

“I have also been impressed with the capability and commitment of our supply partners, who have embraced the plan and contributed hugely to our success.

“On a personal note, seeing the difference that the Fairtrade premium makes on the projects we support in South Africa was very humbling. Finally, as a whisky lover, attending the opening of the new Macallan distillery was pretty special.”

We also asked if there was anything he would do differently and he said: “I think you have to make the best decisions you can with the information you have available. Over the years I have come to accept that you get some right and make some bad calls along the way. Success is winning more than you lose.

“Looking back, I think we set out a plan and executed it very well. With the benefit of additional data, there are clearly opportunities to improve. The time I get worried is the time those opportunities dry up.”",Tesco BWS director sees a drinks industry bursting with opportunities

The distillery in Granton, Edinburgh, has started to produce single malt distillate, bringing single malt whisky production back to the city of Edinburgh for the first time in nearly 100 years.

Chief executive office, Stewart Hainsworth, said: “The business has enjoyed strong growth in the past few years, driven by artisanal spirits and craft beer. The ‘Chain Pier’ distillery in Granton is the first in a series of investments in Scotland. Added to this, construction is currently underway of a larger whisky distillery in Leith, Edinburgh. This will be the new home of John Crabbie & Co. These two distilleries are part of our £50m investment programme in artisanal spirits in the UK.”

The Crabbie whisky business was established in 1801 and it was relaunched in January this year. It has launched bottlings aged from eight to 40 years old, from distilleries around Scotland.

David Brown, Managing Director of John Crabbie & Co, commented: “The Chain Pier distillery in Granton gives us the opportunity to develop a wide range of new spirits, as we wait for our new distillery in Leith to be completed. Laying down our first cask of spirit is a significant milestone for the rejuvenated business and signals the return of single malt whisky production to Edinburgh after an absence of nearly a century”.

Pre-tax profits grew 19% with growth across all regions, including a 10% rise across Europe, driven by “masstige-led premiumisation” as well as continued focus on “the strengthening of strategic customer partnerships”.

Michelle Brampton, who has recently been appointed as managing director for Europe, said that in the UK she is focused on developing the luxury and fine wine arm of the business, which comprises brands such as Penfolds, Wynns and Beringer Vineyards.

Brampton told DRN that a number of premium brands in the portfolio are “all flying”, including Wolf Blass, Lindemans and 19 Crimes, with sales of Wolf Blass up 7%, and 19 Crimes seeing growth of more than 200% over the last 12 months, aided by interest in its augmented reality ‘living wine label’.

M&H Distillery, which was founded in Tel Aviv in 2012, was the first whisky distillery to open in Israel. It currently produces a young single malt spirit, Levantine Gin, and herbal liqueurs, and Maverick will bring Israel’s first Single Malt Whisky to the UK market in late 2019.

UK consumers are increasingly seeking out imported whiskies. Brands from countries such as Japan and Canada have seen volume increases, and whiskies from other countries – including Australia and those from Scandinavia – are also starting to appear in the UK. CGA data to March 24, 2018 shows sales of imported whiskies have grown 3.4% compared to four years earlier.

The hot and humid weather in Tel Aviv means the whisky matures and extracts barrel flavour quickly, giving the young spirit plenty of flavour and the characteristics of a whisky aged for much longer in a colder climate, according to the producer.

M&H’s current Young Single Malt is matured in three types of cask (bourbon, red wine and Islay) providing intense notes of black cherry and red berry fruits, with hints of vanilla, candyfloss and subtle smokiness.

Also in M&H’s core range is its Levantine Gin, which features local botanicals such as Za’atar, lemon peel, orange and lemon verbena, and is also available oak aged. The distillery also makes a herbal liqueur called Roots filled with regional ingredients such as cardamom, thyme, almonds, coriander and jasmine.

Michael Vachon, Maverick’s head of brand development, said; “M&H is rightfully taking its place as a leader in the New World whisky category. Israel’s Mediterranean climate, unique among significant whisky producers, coupled with the innovative production methods laid down by the late Dr Jim Swan, an expert on warm weather distilling, mean their spirits have a real depth and maturity to them that is on par with (or better than) many much older whiskies.”

Eitan Attir, chief executive of M&H, said: ""The M&H Distillery is very enthusiastic about this future long term partnership with Maverick Drinks, who we believe is the best partner to develop and build the brand. The UK is one of our first markets outside of Israel and we are excited to bring to the country a bit of our Tel-Aviv'ien sun and fine spirit.”

M&H joins Maverick Drinks’ growing roster of unique international craft spirits brands including Ableforth’s, Balcones, Bluecoat Gin, Brenne, Darkness!, Drinks by the Dram, Empirical Spirits, FEW Spirits, Kyrö Distillery Company, Mr Lyan, New York Distilling Company, Oslo Distillery, Smooth Ambler, St George Spirits, Teeling, That Boutique-y Gin Company, That Boutique-y Rum Company, That Boutique-y Whisky Company, Widow Jane and Wolfburn.

Embrazen celebrates female trailerblazers from the 20th century and it is designed to be “bold, unapologetic and disruptive”.

It follows on from 19 Crimes, a brand designed to win over male millennials through augmented reality technology on the labels and a new approach to design and marketing.

Embrazen also uses the augmented reality labels, which allow drinkers to discover more about the stories behind the wines by scanning them with their smartphones.

They shine a light on Nellie Bly, an investigative journalist who went undercover to report on horrific conditions in asylums and sweatshops, and aviator Amy Johnson, the first woman to fly solo from Britain to Australia in 1930.

“One of TWE’s core strategic aims is to drive recruitment of 18 to 35-year-old drinkers, bringing them into the wine category,” said marketing director Kirstie McCosh. “We know through the success of 19 Crimes that the way to do this is through authentic, brand story-telling experiences, and we are confident that Embrazen delivers on all these cues.”

She hopes it will appeal to younger adults that are inspired by stories of positive change. The Embrazen range was unveiled in the US in August 2018 and it is also gearing up for a launch in Australia.

Michelle Brampton now spearheads TWE in the UK and she has pledged to keep innovating and trying to resonate with consumers by telling stories that go beyond simple branding.

“We bring genuine innovation to bring new consumers into the category, to activate it through technology, and we have credibility in our brands and our wine,” she said in an interview with DRN this month.

Treasury Wine Estates is the second largest wine supplier to the UK trade, with brands including Wolf Blass, Lindemans, Blossom Hill, Penfolds, Beringer Vineyards and Wynn’s.

After promoting Brampton to the top role, it recently appointed Tony Watson as commercial director for the UK.

Watson was previously the managing director at Orchard Pig, and prior to that he spent more than 20 years at Carlsberg UK in various sales and operational roles across the on and off-trade.

The event, hosted by Lady of the Grapes’ owner, Carole Byron, will be held at the venue in Covent Garden on March 5, and it will feature a panel of expert guests.

Rebecca Palmer, wine buyer and associate director for Corney & Barrow, will be joined by winemakers Vivien Ujvari (Barta Winery, Hungary) and Wendy Outhwaite (Ambriel Winery, Sussex), to share their stories and journeys of working in the wine industry.

The evening event will including a tasting of six wines from Barta and Ambriel. Each will be presented by the winemaker and paired with an amuse bouche.

Byron said: “It was when I first started in the wine industry that I realised there were not a lot of women. I want to support all women, from those who work in the vineyard to others selling wine in the shop. I thought it would be good to sue the global reach of International Women’s Day to champion women in the wine trade. My aim is to try and make them more visible through our wine list, because it is not just men who make wine.”

International Women’s Day (IWD) is a global day, which takes place on Friday March 8, to celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. The day also marks a call to action for accelerating gender parity.

Nik Antona has been elected to the post of chairman at the Campaign for Real Ale at a meeting of the organisation’s national executive.

He is due to take office in April following Camra’s members' weekend, AGM and conference, to be held in Dundee this year.

He takes over the position from Jackie Parker, who is standing down after a year in the role.

Antona said: ""I'm delighted and honoured by the confidence my National Executive colleagues have shown in me. Jackie has been a strong leader for the organisation and I'm keen to carry on where she will leave off: making sure Camra is effective in its national campaigns, especially in seeking much-needed reform of the Pubs Code, calling for a review of business rates on pubs, and campaigning to get a reduction in beer tax on pints served in pubs.”

Parker, the organisation’s former vice-chairman, was elected in December 2017 and took over the role in April 2018. Her predecessor, Colin Valentine, held the position for seven years.

She said: ""It's with great sadness that I choose to step down as chairman of Camra. I believe it's healthy for an organisation to refresh its leadership regularly, and now is the time to step aside and give someone else the opportunity to lead.""

Founded in 1971, Camra is a democratic not-for-profit voluntary organisation with some 200,000 members nationwide. Its directors are unpaid.

Under the Defra scheme, a deposit would be added to the price of drinks bought in both plastic and glass bottles and in cans. The deposit would then be refunded when consumers returned the empty containers to a designated return point.

Consultation on the scheme, which is designed to increase recycling and reduce littering, began yesterday.

In response, Miles Beale, chief executive of the WSTA, praised the government’s commitment to tackling waste and improving recycling.

But Beale cautioned against the inclusion of glass in the scheme. “Glass must be treated differently to plastic,” he said. “It cannot be compacted safely and efficiently, unlike plastic, and broken glass is much more likely to cause injury.

“Following years of investment in recycling, councils across the UK already have well-established, trusted and efficient doorstep-recycling schemes.

“Changes to this system, which could instead see consumers themselves burdened with returning glass bottles to point of purchase, are unnecessary. Changes would also pose storage issues for retailers, especially SMEs.”

The proposals, as currently framed, could actually prove a retrograde step, Beale added.

Including glass in any DRS system would serve only to undermine existing recycling schemes, and would be highly likely to undermine achievements to date,"" he said.

Penderyn Whisky has been given the green light – and £3.75 million - to expand the business by building a new distillery and visitor centre.

The Welsh producer intends to redevelop a disused building at the historic Hafod Morfa Copperworks site in Swansea.

The lottery Heritage Fund recently awarded £3.75 million towards regenerating the 19th Century Powerhouse building into the visitor centre and distillery.

As part of the restoration Penderyn will replace the clock tower and it will also build its new Visitor Centre alongside and to the rear of the Powerhouse. This new facility will be set over three floors, and it will include a Penderyn Whisky exhibition centre, shop, a tasting bar, conference suite and an exhibition covering the history of the old Copperworks.

Stephen Davies, Penderyn’s chief executive, said: “Penderyn is delighted to bring back a copper-based industry back to this area. Once opened we hope to see up to 100,000 visitors a year, and it will become one of the major attractions in the area. This all helps us promote our whiskies from Wales to the world.”

Construction is expected to begin at the end of this year with plans to open in 2022.

Wales currently has four working distilleries for whisky, including Aber Falls Distillery in Abergwyngregyn, North Wales; Coles Family Distillery in Carmarthen; Penderyn Distillery in Merthyr Tydfil; and Da Mhile Distillery in Llandusul.

She has worked with Marks & Spencer for nine years in several buying roles and within Sainsbury’s wine department before that.

As a senior wine buyer at Berkmann, Dawson will be responsible for regional France (including Bordeaux, Loire, Alsace and Jura), South and Central America, as well as premium producers from Southern Italy.

She has a specialist knowledge of emerging regions, which she will use to develop the Berkmann portfolio further into areas such as the Eastern Mediterranean, Middle East and Asia.

She said: “I am looking forward to becoming part of the continuing transformation at Berkmann that has seen it double in turnover in the past five years.

Spirits buyer John Vine told DRN: “Seedlip is doing phenomenally well for us and we had a really good January for spirits this year because of it. We are now looking at listing other alcohol- free spirits.”

Vine said sales increased 8.5% across spirits for January 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, driven by demand for the alcohol-free spirit.

He added: “I was really impressed when I tried an alcohol- free cocktail called a No Negroni using Seedlip Spice. The quality was fantastic and it was perfect for me for a night out when I didn’t want to drink too much.

“If people aren’t drinking alcohol I do wrangle with the question of whether they should have to spend £10 on a good- quality non-alcoholic cocktail in the on-trade.

Alcohol-free is putting pressure on our shelf space but it is a sign that times are changing and we have to evolve with it. We are looking at how we can give up more space to non-alcoholic beers and spirits.

“The trend is there and you either embrace it or you lose out. And this is where we have to start embracing the challenges this brings. It’s all about adding to people’s repertoires with a variety of drinks.

“But, as with all the drinks we try out for our shelves, alcohol or not, it still has to perform well.”

Vine reports continued strong growth from various sectors of premium spirits, including gin and a growing interest in rum. The latter is up by 12.5% year on year.

He added: “We brought in some higher-level rums to help people trade up. It’s helping to bring in more interest and I feel we have a more curated range at the moment in Waitrose.

“We have stripped right back on our white rum because this is the sector that has been really in decline, apart from J Wray & Nephew, which is a premium product. By reducing the amount of white rum we have been able to focus more on flavoured and premium.”

Waitrose is also considering another drinks festival as a result of the success of its annual November event.

The consumer event runs from a Friday evening until Sunday, attracting 4,000 Waitrose customers.

Vine said: “It’s a great way of getting these customers in front of wine and spirits producers via tastings and masterclasses.

“The easiest way of showing our range is to get liquid on lips. We want it to be educational and we highlight NPD and products from smaller producers. We have done this for three years now and it is really tiring but the feedback from customers is great.

“We have talked about running a spring and a winter one, but one of the hardest things is the venue, along with resource and investment, but it is something we would like to do more of.”

or whatever form of Brexit the country takes”, according to chief operating officer Jon Pepper MW.

He told DRN: “It is very difficult for companies to prepare when we don’t know things such as what the tariffs will be. We work with JF Hillebrand and it has done a lot of contingency planning, but apart from that it is really hard to know.

“The other thing is that, globally, the uncertainty around the UK market is inevitably making it less interesting to some producers, but we are still one of the best nations for wines and spirits.”

Enotria is working on a number of projects for 2019, including a focus on vegan wines, products from Mexico and low-alcohol options.

Pepper said: “We are increasingly conscious about people’s lifestyle choices and we have a lot in the range already that are sustainably produced and so on. It is more about us pulling that information out and flagging it up better.”

Pepper confirmed Enotria will “inevitably add more” when it comes to the company’s extensive range of 350 gins, 150 of which were added to the portfolio in 2018.

“The interesting trend is regional so we are looking at how we put together a portfolio for each area, and we are looking at the really interesting stuff for off-trade retailers.

“We will also have a big push on Mexico this year, with a focus on mescal and sotol. We are looking at broadening that category out with some higher-end more specialised spirits. Mexico is a really interesting trend in food and drink.”

For low and no-alcohol Enotria has added a number of new products, including beers from Small Beer and Big Drop, and

soft drinks such as kombucha. Pepper also points to vermouth as a category to watch for people looking for lighter drinks.

“The trend for low and no-alcohol works really well for vermouth and people are starting to take to mixing it with tonic, like you would with a G&T. It works well in spritzers and cocktails too, and it’s great for that low-alcohol serve. We have Regal Rogue vermouth from Australia in our portfolio and it’s doing really well.

“We have also been looking at broadening our range of products from English producers as the line is blurring between UK-produced wine and spirits, with wine producers bringing out vermouth, for example.”

Looking back at 2018, Enotria has seen a lot of interest in indigenous grapes, particularly those from Italy such as Vermentino and drier-style whites, Pepper said.

“People are branching out and becoming more and more confident. We have been working hard to get the right price points so that these wines are accessible to consumers, so around £6-7 where you can really start to offer great value for money, and encourage people to try these lesser-known grapes and styles.

“It becomes about partnerships with suppliers and working with them. So we did a really big partnership with Viña San Pedro recently and revitalised the 35 South brand, which we are about to push out. These are really well- made fruit-driven wines with more elegance. They are more complex and you can drink them with food.”

Just before Christmas a single bottle of Penfolds Grange 1951 became the most expensive Australian wine ever sold at auction, fetching a cool £44,000. It is interesting to note that the iconic Penfolds brand, beloved of fabulously rich oenophiles, sits in a portfolio alongside Blossom Hill White Zinfandel, the UK’s bestselling rosé. Boosting sales of both brands, positioned at diametrically opposing ends of the market, is the challenge facing Michelle Brampton, who has just taken over from Tom King as managing director for Europe at Treasury Wine Estates.

Also within her remit is the trailblazing 19 Crimes brand, plus Australian heavyweights such as Wolf Blass and Lindemans, but she is keen to talk about luxury wines when DRN meets her at TWE’s office in Twickenham.

“My ambition and focus is to develop into the luxury and fine wine arena,” she says. She notes that TWE has had to focus on “the bread and butter” of the portfolio over the past couple of years, while managing luxury brands such as as Penfolds, Wynns and Beringer Vineyards more tightly, but she is confident in this sector, despite the economic uncertainty currently facing Britain. “In the UK there’s a group of consumers who are passionate about fine wine and luxury, and wine is a proven investment through challenging economic times,” she says.

TWE is analysing routes to market in order to figure out the best way to grow its footprint in the UK’s luxury wine arena, but it is not neglecting its heartland. Blossom Hill seemed a strange fit for a company that prided itself on selling premium wines when it joined the portfolio in 2015. That was a by-product of TWE purchasing Diageo’s Californian wine interests, including Beaulieu Vineyards and Sterling Vineyards, and when the news was announced, chief executive Michael Clarke focused entirely on how the deal was “a game-changer” that would “transform” the firm’s presence in the fast-growing US luxury wine market.

Blossom Hill, previously distributed by Diageo subsidiary Percy Fox, then transferred to TWE’s European team. Since then it has fallen down the list of the UK’s bestselling wine brands after experiencing volume and value decline. It was formerly a top three brand in the off-trade, but Blossom Hill and rival Echo Falls have since been leapfrogged by Barefoot, McGuigan and Yellow Tail. You could view that as TWE either neglecting the brand or struggling to get a grip on it, but Brampton has an interesting point to make about under-bond trading.

“Since we’ve owned it as a company, we’ve stepped away from any under-bond trading,” she says. “It’s to do the right thing for the brand, the right thing for the company and the right thing in terms of HMRC and the regulations in the market. That’s driven quite a significant decline in that brand.”

Reading between the lines, it appears Blossom Hill was previously a key brand for those committing duty fraud and HMRC had earmarked it as a source of concern, so TWE decided to take a hit on sales in order to do the right thing and become best friends with the revenue and customs gang.

Brampton also speaks passionately about the success the company has enjoyed with Blossom Hill, which now sells for 61p a bottle more than Echo Falls and is turning around its sales performance.

“It’s still a big US brand and it’s still the biggest rosé brand, with massive consumer awareness, higher than any other brand at 85%,” she says. “It has an incredible history. It’s back in growth in grocery. It just won a product of the year award with the launch of pale rosé, which is taking the rosé consumer on a journey to a slightly drier style. There’s innovation to keep the brand relevant and I intend us to evolve its position slightly and keep innovating against it.”

Meanwhile, Wolf Blass, Lindemans and 19 Crimes are all flying. “Wolf Blass is doing really well,” says Brampton. “It’s in about 7% MAT growth. Yellow Label is a core range and it will be very visible for us over the summer as a sponsor of the ICC cricket World Cup. There has already been some activation in stores on winning tickets, and there will be lots more of that. It’s got a lot of heritage and credibility in winemaking, and the top end of Wolf Blass plays into that luxury, premium strategy.

“Lindemans has had a brand refresh, which is serving it well and helping it stand out on shelf.

“The stellar performer for us is 19 Crimes. Over the past 12 months it’s been in 200-plus per cent growth, with four times as many sales this Christmas as last Christmas, and 2 million downloads of the living wine label.”

The 19 Crimes brand is aimed at male millennials and uses augmented reality known as “living wine label” to help shoppers discover the story behind every bottle on their smartphones. It focuses on the 19 offences that carried the punishment of transportation to Australia in the 19th century, replete with pictures of grizzled convicts on the labels.

“This innovation appeals to the consumer through the pack, the story and the technology and creates a conversation, but then leaves them to discover a wine they like as well,” says Brampton. “That seems to be really working. The living wine label peaks in downloads at big social occasions, where people are sharing the story and downloading the app.

“We get lots of great feedback on the wine as well. If you can get people into the category with how it looks and fun stuff on the app, you start to convert people into wine. I see people on Facebook saying they didn’t like red wine, but they love this. Once people start to understand the stories, what the 19 crimes were and what happened to 160,000 people, it creates another conversation behind the wines as well.”

Brampton has been with the business since 2002, when she became financial planning controller at Southcorp Wines. Foster’s took over Southcorp in 2006, and she became commercial operations and business development controller at the firm. Treasury Wine Estates was demerged from Foster’s in 2011 and Brampton was promoted to commercial finance director at TWE two years later. She then served as chief finance officer for Europe and became commercial director last year, before being catapulted into the top job at one of the UK’s largest wine suppliers when King left to become chief operating officer for Asia.

She is now arguably the most senior woman in the UK wine trade and she could serve as an inspiration to young women who want to rise to the top of what was historically a male-dominated industry. When asked what advice she would give such young women, she says: “Be tenacious. If the opportunities present themselves, go for it. Be courageous, even if it doesn’t feel that comfortable. Take the opportunities for the experience and the development.”

TWE has been ranked among the top 10 places in Britain to work for women and one of the best places to work in general, and Brampton hopes to foster a culture of collaboration and inclusivity. “For me it’s important that people continue to love coming to work here and feel like they can make a difference every day,” she says.

She takes the helm at a challenging time, as a duty hike on wine has just kicked in – despite beer and spirits being spared as a result of strong lobbying from those industries – and Brexit looms large. But Brampton sees plenty of opportunities in the current market.

“There are clearly opportunities around innovation, younger consumers, creating exciting brands that bring people into the category, signposting, trying to help the consumer navigate the wall of wine, which brands can help to do,” she says. “The challenges are around the tax regime, excise duty, the impact it has on the consumer and the high street, and consolidation and changes within the retailing market itself, and the impact that has on consumer choice. The volatility of it being the world’s biggest import market brings challenges depending on vintages and foreign exchange, and economic impacts present ongoing challenges.

“Like any business we would like some certainty. We have been working and planning for the past six to nine months to mitigate any impacts that are likely to come with whatever the Brexit outcome is. We feel we’ve got good plans in place, because the number one priority is continuity of supply, and that’s what we’ve been focused on. We’ve done as much as we can, knowing what we do.”

When asked about the impact of duty and whether the wine trade needs to be better at hammering home to policymakers its economic impact and the number of jobs it supports, she says: “The trade does need to, especially with how significant the import part of the wine business is and the bottling and production that goes on here. But there’s also the impact it has on consumers. Wine is consumers’ favourite drink. Although beer has an impact on pubs, wine not only has an impact on pubs, but in high street restaurant chains that are less profitable today. The consumer is impacted by prices. It ripples through at every level.”

Yet retail standards currently appear high in the multiples when it comes to branded wine, and there is an opportunity to boost sales in impulse, so wine could flourish in the years ahead.

“A lot of the retailers have done a good job of rationalising the ranges and are in a much better spot,” says Brampton. “Also they are focusing on understanding if the range works, so there is less change, which has to be good for everybody in the supply chain. It is easier to shop.

“There’s always more that can be done, whether it’s on food matching or taste profiling, but that’s where brands have a big role to play – in helping signpost consumers to something they know they like, or something that’s a consistent and reliable product. It can either draw consumers in or continue to give them confidence in what they’re buying. We’ve seen own-label start to decline in the past 12 months and brands have grown.

“For convenience, similar to the bigger retailers, it’s simplifying their range, and taking it seriously, because a basket with a bottle of wine in it is double the spend of a basket without a bottle of wine in it. The advantage they have is that they often have chillers, especially near to the tills, so should make the most of that for white, rosé and sparkling for that impulse purchase.”

Going forwards the plan is to ramp up innovation, push into luxury and keep the stable of brands relevant to the modern consumer.

“We will keep innovating and trying to resonate with the stories we tell. With Blossom Hill, talking about friendship and the female collective is a conversation starter as well as just a product.

“We bring genuine innovation to bring new consumers into the category, to activate it through technology, and we have credibility in our brands and our wine.”

Brockmans picked up a listing with the Co-op towards the end of last year and it is also stocked by Marks & Spencer, Harvey Nicholls and Asda.

The super-premium gin, which is now also available in 40 countries, celebrated its tenth anniversary last October. At the time it announced revenue up 35% year-on-year to £4.7 million. In the UK revenue is up 90%.

The gin is made using berries and botanicals sourced from across the world: juniper from Italy; lemon peel from Murcia in Spain; bitter-sweet orange peel from Valencia; Bulgarian coriander seed; cassia bark from Indo-China; blueberries and blackberries from Northern Europe; liquorice from China, angelica from Belgium; bitter almonds form Spain; and Italian orris root.

Gary Hyde, Senior Purchasing Manager at Ocado, said: ""Brockmans Gin, with its unique blend of botanicals and smooth taste, justifies its position within our premium range of spirits.”

Elliott Clark of Indie Brands, Brockmans' UK Distributor, said: ""Brockmans is already stocked by a number of major multiples and it is good to be able to bring this gin to customers of such an important online delivery grocer. Although Ocado already lists well over 100 gin labels, this - the ‘gin like no other' - still manages to add an important new offering to the portfolio for Ocado customers due to its distinctive taste profile and packaging.""

Dingle is among the “new generation” of distilleries in Ireland, having opened its doors in 2012 in southwest Kerry. It became the first privately-owned, purpose-built distillery to open in more than 100 years in Ireland, and it still claims to be one of the only distillers that sources grain, distills spirit, ages and bottles whiskey for its own exclusive releases.

The producer has Dingle Single Malt Triple-Distilled Whiskey Batch No. 3 (rrp: £109), Single Original Gin (rrp: £35) and the five-times distilled Dingle Artisan Vodka (rrp: £33), each produced in copper pot stills.

Chris Jones, managing director of Paragon Brands, said: “We are incredibly proud to be working with the exceptional range of award-winning Dingle Irish premium craft spirits, which complement the Paragon premium spirits portfolio perfectly.”

The Irish whiskey industry has grown rapidly over the past few years. From two distilleries in 1985 the industry now boasts more than 30 distilleries, some of which are new and therefore still under construction. Many producers are also investing in order to increase capacity or to enhance visitor facilities. It is believed that by 2025, Ireland could have more than 50 distilleries.

We have teamed up with sister title Harpers and Anne Burchett, a veritable doyenne of the French wine industry, to launch the event, which takes place on March 26 in central London.

Trade partners include generic bodies covering Bordeaux, the Languedoc, the Loire and Cahors and producers such as Gerard Bertrand, Boisset and Bouvet Ladubay, while expert presenters such as Greg Sherwood MW and Rebecca Gibb MW will be on hand to host masterclasses.

We caught up with Burchett to find out more about the plans for the event:

Why did you decide to launch Think France?

France is one of the major wine suppliers to the UK, both in terms of market share – as it remains the leading country or origin for the on-trade – and in terms of image, as it produces more iconic wines than any other wine-producing country. Yet there wasn’t any professional event delivering both content and tasting experience, solely dedicated to the whole of France, in the British wine calendar. Think France, a one-day event brimming with content and exciting wines to taste, plugs that gap handsomely.

France is an incredibly diverse country in terms of wines, maybe the most diverse one worldwide. Buyers of French wines will be able to explore this diversity at Think France in a very time-efficient manner, yet without any pressure, as this is a human scale event with a limited number of partners and attendees, all of which are vetted for their relevance to the event. Think France partners and sponsors cover the whole of France yet have been tasked with presenting compact ranges at the event. The wines on show will include well known benchmarks for the French wine offer as well as new and undiscovered wines. The various masterclasses will allow buyers to explore the French offer whereas the debate will highlight five key opportunities for French wines in the UK, with well-respected and knowledgeable speakers.

Why is having a strong French wine range crucial for retailers that want to thrive in 2019?

French wines are aspirational for British consumers and their diversity allows retailers to create and retain essential and strong points of difference in their ranges. French wines offer huge versatility and variety to buyers and consumers alike. For independent wine merchants, French wines are brilliant wines to hand-sell with lots of human stories behind the wines.

What are some of the highlights that visitors can look forward to at Think France?

Three days before B-day, we’ll have Julie Poirot from the French Embassy giving attendees the definite French position on Brexit. The main debate will tackle the five key opportunities for French wines in the UK market. The masterclasses will provide unique insight in specific areas of the French offer and the wines on our partners’ tables will be a carefully curated selection of what France can bring to play in the uniquely competitive yet exciting British market.

Why is it important for buyers and suppliers and others in the industry to meet up and share best practice?

No man is an island. Fresh ideas, debates, discussions, even controversial ones open new vistas in life as well as in business. We’re all caught up in the daily grind but it is imperative to pause and give oneself time to think every now and again in order to remain on top of one’s game. When it comes to wine and particularly to French wines, there is always something new to learn and discover and Think France aims to deliver an unparalleled amount of rich content and tasting experiences.",Think France to provide buyers with vital content and exciting wines

Laurent Delaunay, president of Badet Clement, bought his great grandfather’s business, Edouard Delaunay, from Boisset in 2017. He invested 1.5million Euros to return it to its former glory and he has now announced plans to relaunch it at the Wine Paris show on February 11, 2019.

The relaunch will include a presentation of the new Edouard Delaunay collection on Badet Clement’s stand (G064) followed by an exclusive dinner for prestige clients at Ducasse sur Seine by French culinary legend, Alain Ducasse.

Edouard Delaunay was created in 1893 and it is considered to be one of the major players in the development of the Burgundian wine region. The business was sold in 1992 to Boisset, due to the business of its then director, Jean-Marie Delaunay.

The extensive refurbishment of the historic cellars and winery at Chateau de Charmont in the Hautes-Cotes de Nuits to one year and will enable Badet Clement, specialists in branded wines from Burgundy, the Languedoc, Provence and the Rhone, to vinify and age their wines with precision under the expertise of winemaker Christophe Briotet.

Laurent Delaunay said: “My grandfather used to say that the House of Edouard Delaunay was ‘the smallest of the great Houses’. My ambition has been to return it to its former glory and make Edouard Delaunay a leading Burgundian wine house once more, focused on excellence and high-end wines mainly from the Côte de Nuits and Côte de Beaune.”

“Thanks to many top estates that we are already working with via our company, DVP, which distributes Burgundian domaines, we already have grapes in prestigious appellations like Corton-Charlemagne, Charmes-Chambertin and Clos-Vougeot. From our second vintage, we will have some rare wines such as Montrachet and a Griotte-Chambertin.

He continued: “We also have contemporary, accessible wines like those from the young appellation, Bourgogne Côte d’Or”. Edouard Delaunay currently buys in grapes and will consider buying vineyards in the future if good opportunities arise.

“We want to create a direct relationship with consumers who are interested in Burgundy wines and give them a real introduction into the region; its culture, philosophy, vineyards, art de vivre…the things which inspire wine enthusiasts, but which often remain out of reach because of the Burgundy’s exclusivity.”

The newcomers include two new fruity flavours: Fizzy Rhubarb and Fizzy Blackcurrant, which will join their core range of sodas.

Dalston’s is also introducing a new range of Soda Lights: Real Squeezed Elderflower and Real Squeezed Rhubarb, which are made with no added sugar or sweeteners and contain 20 calories per can. The Lights are made from just fruit, distilled botanicals and sparkling spring water.

Over the last year Dalston’s said it has sold more than two million cans of its Classic Sodas. The drinks are stocked in 2,500 shops in the UK.

Founder, Duncan O’Brien, said: “Millennials are losing their taste for sugar, and placing even more emphasis on health. That’s why we chose to develop our new range of Lights – which we will be adding to, over the next few years. Competitors cram their ‘diet’ drinks with sweeteners or artificial flavourings, which is not good for you. It was time for us to step up and show what naturally light, refreshing fruity sodas should really taste like.”

Dalston’s was first set up by a group of friends in East London in 2012. The new drinks will join the existing range, which currently comprises: Lemonade, Ginger Beer, Cherryade, Orangeade and Fizzy Elderflower.

Elicite.com will attempt to “redefine the way consumers experience and purchase fine wine” by combining educational content with mixed case sales.

Wine director Martyn Zemavicius said: “We are extremely pleased to introduce a disruptive content-led fine wine ecommerce platform that offers not only exclusive wines and champagnes, but is dedicated to empowering consumers to make educated decisions and experience fine wine from a new perspective.”

Zemavicius is a co-founder of Clos & Cru, which was owned by a parent company called Grand Clos Ltd. The firm was renamed as Elicite Ltd in May 2018 and Clos & Cru will cease to trade when Elicite launches in February.

Zemavicius (pictured, right, at Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte) remains the wine director and John Fleetwood remains the managing director of the company. He has spent most of his most of his career working for multinationals like Coca-Cola and Unilever, while Zemavicius started as a sommelier at London’s OXO Tower restaurant before moving into fine-wine buying and sales to trade and private customers.

He has recruited Alistair Cooper MW to narrate a seven-part film series covering the basics of correctly serving, storing and drinking fine wine, its hidden costs, how to easily read and understand wine labels and the basics of wine making.

Elicite will then divide content into four levels of experience, starting with The Explorer and ascending to The Connoisseur, The Expert, and finally The Master.

Clement Robert MS, Ronan Sayburn MS of 67 Pall Mall, and Bjornstierne Antonson, head sommelier at the Richard Juhlin Champagne Club have contributed to the film content and offered wine selections for the platform.

Elicite has the UK exclusive for Champagne Houses Bonnaire, Roger Brun and Paul Clouet, and it will uphold the trading relationships with producers like Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte, Charles Heidsieck, Penfolds, and Vietti that Clos & Cru built up.

The team at Elicite hopes to “engage a new generation of wine lovers while offering new perspectives to those with more developed experience”.

Scotch Whisky specialist Douglas Laing & Co has released its Year of the Pig Limited Edition bottlings in celebration of the Lunar New Year.

The XOP Single Cask of a Sherry matured Craigellachie 1995 Vintage and two Old Particular Single Casks – a Bunnahabhain 2007 and a Glengoyne 2007 – have been unveiled to mark the Lunar New Year, the most celebrated of Chinese traditions.

The vintages were specially selected as both 1995 and 2007 were previous Years of the Pig within the Chinese Zodiac calendar. The three Single Casks have all been bottled at natural cask strength.

The XOP numbered bottles are presented in wooden gift boxes and they carry a hand-signed certificate with a New Year message from father and daughter duo, Fred and Cara Laing, chairman and director of Whisky at Douglas Laing.

Fred Laing said: “Despite numerous visits to the Far East since the early 1970’s, I have never been there during Chinese New Year, so to participate in this fashion with these rare bottlings, each so full of Eastern promise, is wonderful and we’re thrilled to commemorate this iconic cultural moment. We hope our friends in Asia enjoy celebrating New Year with these Whiskies.”

The XOP Craigellachie Single Cask has a rich mocha, cocoa character with candied peels, allspice and stewed red fruits, the result of more than two decades resting in a Sherry butt.

The Old Particular Bunnahabhain is said to reveal the archetypical Islay style of sweet peat alongside honeycomb, a coastal influence and citrus fruits.

The Old Particular Glengoyne meanwhile shows milk chocolate and honeyed barley with a spiced warmth at its core.

Spirits, wine, cider, bottled water and low/no alcohol beer are all key growth areas across the Welsh drinks sector, according to the voice of Wales’ food and drink, the Food and Drink Wales Industry Board (FDWIB). The drinks industry already makes a significant contribution to the Welsh economy, with a Welsh retail sales value of more than £950 million, according to the FDWIB.

The ‘Growing the Drinks Industry in Wales’ strategy has been led by the Drinks Cluster, as well as the FDWIB and Welsh Government.

The Welsh Drinks Cluster was established in March 2017 by Lesley Griffiths, cabinet secretary for Environment Planning an Rural Affairs, to raise the profile of the Welsh drinks sector and to lay out the direction for the industry, which is growing in diversity as well as commercial value.

Andy Richardson, chair of the FDWIB, said: “The development of the drinks sector strategy marks a key stage of the Drinks Cluster’s journey. Initial cluster activity has revealed a number of strategic priorities, which respond to the industry’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. These priorities have been identified as innovation, scale up, marketing and skills.”

The strategy details significant areas of growth such as spirits and low alcohol beers. It highlights gin and rum, where there has been substantial growth, and it also shows no/ low alcohol beer has outperformed others in the beer and ale category.

It also analyses barriers to growth, such as skills shortages, access to energy, changing consumption patterns and the decline of pubs and traditional on-trade outlets. Other factors include sugar tax, minimum unit pricing and consumer attitudes to plastic.

To tackle the challenge of skills shortages, the Cluster has begun engaging with the National Skills Academy for Food and Drink. This collaboration will result in the first-ever bespoke provision of technical training requirements for Welsh brewers in partnership with BrewLab.

Richardson continued: “The next step for the cluster will involve working within Special Interest Groups to develop an identity and marketing strategy tailored to each sector’s positioning and needs. Our aim is that by working together on the key strategic priorities we will: help build Welsh drink brands both at home and abroad; improve skills and knowledge across the sector to support innovation and increase the environmental performance of the drinks industry.”

Naked Wines has retained its title as the UK’s most popular online drinks retailer when it comes to monthly searches.

A new report from search engine strategy firm Salience Search Marketing shows that it receives an average of 201,000 searches per month.

That represents a 21.8% rise on the 165,000 searches it was receiving a year ago, and puts it well ahead of closest competitors bargainbooze.co.uk, which received 60,500 searches, and laithwaites.co.uk, which generated 49,500 searches on average.

It caps a strong trading period for Naked Wines, which just revealed that its UK business enjoyed 12.2% year-on-year growth in the 10 weeks to December 31.

“The team have worked really hard over the Christmas trading period and have delivered sales growth across all our business units,” said founder and chief executive Rowan Gormley.

Salience Search Marketing assigned each online retailer an “owned social score” depending on how strong its social media offering is. It took this into account, along with each retailer’s searches per month, to create a chart of the top 30 online retailers in the UK for brand reach.

Naked Wines is on top, with Bargain Booze second and Fortnum & Mason third, although that retailer is clearly focused more than simply drinks.

Master of Malt took fourth place, followed by The Whisky Exchange and Majestic, which is part of the same group as Naked Wines and also run by Gormley.

Laithwaites was seventh, malts.com was eighth, Virgin Wines was ninth and The Wine Society rounded out the top 10. Virgin Wines also recently reported strong sales growth, further highlighting the strength of the UK online wine retailing scene.

Salience ranked Adnams as the 11th best retailer for online brand reach, for its online cellar and kitchen offering. Beerwulf was next in the list, with Berry Bros’ & Rudd in 13th, followed by Honest Brew, Beer Hawk, Whisky Shop, Flavourly, 31Dover, Waitrose Cellar and Drink Supermarket.

Oddbins’ ecommerce proposition was 21st, followed by Beer Merchants, Tanners Wine, Wine Direct, Loch Fyne Whiskies, Drinks Direct, Slurp, Clos 19, VIP Bottles and finally Liquor Online in 30th.

The five retailers with the best social score from Salience are, in order, The Whisky Exchange, Fortnum & Mason, 31Dover, Bargain Booze and Master of Malt.

Social scores consider followers and engaged conversations on all major social platforms. The top five are said to have a strong following, creating engagement through content and product campaigns.

When it comes to link authority, Master of Malt is top of the pile, followed by The Whisky Exchange, Fortnum & Mason, BBR and Laithwaites.

Salience Search Marketing highlighted Adnams, Oddbins, Waitrose Cellar, Beer Hawk and Roberson Wine as having a low volume of high quality referrals on a monthly basis.

Those retailers are advised to scale that activity to successfully compete.

Meanwhile, Drink Supermarket, Whisky Shop, Virgin Wines, Loch Fyne Whiskies and Drinks Direct are said to have a high volume of low quality referrals each month.

Consistently gaining a low quantity of high-authority links could show that a brand has the right link-building foundations in place, but needs to work on scaling that activity to successfully compete in their marketplace, said Salience.

When it comes to increasing visibility year-on-year, The Drink Shop, 31Dover, Virgin Wines, Beer Hawk and the Sunday Times’ online wine club are the five big winners. The five losers are Fortnum & Mason, Urban Drinks, Master of Malt, Adnams and Calais Wine, according to Salience.

“The top five have successfully grown with the market,” it said. “In some cases they’ve even exceeded market growth. Even if the bottom five have increased visibility year-on-year, their market share has taken a pounding. Blame the top five.”

Finally, it highlighted 10 underperforming sites. According to the Salience team, five high visibility sites with low authority are Beer Hawk, Tanners, Clos 19, Wine Direct and Urban Drinks. “These brands could benefit most from a more expansive search marketing campaign,” it said. “Things are looking good technically, and a strategic content marketing campaign is likely to yield positive results.”

Five high authority sites with low visibility are Adnams, Drinks Direct, Beer Merchants, Vintage Wine Gifts and Slurp. “These brands could benefit most from resolving their on-site tech and structural issues. Identification of those problems, and dealing with them in a priority order should be in their sites,” it said.

The WSTA is calling for a temporary suspension on wine tariffs to prevent prices rocketing in the event of a no deal Brexit.

The wine trade body said prices would reach an all-time high if the government cannot agree on a divorce deal with the EU before crashing out of the union.

It is campaigning for a six to 12 month suspension on wine tariffs to reduce the strain on the supply chain that a no deal Brexit would spark.

It argues that there would be minimal impact to Treasury coffers and probably cost much less than having to introduce a system for collection of tariffs on products that currently enter the UK tariff free.

Chief executive Miles Beale said: “Since the referendum, the WSTA has campaigned consistently for a deal with the EU that delivers frictionless trade in goods, with no additional tariffs or costs.

“If the UK ends up with a no-deal Brexit then wine businesses will have to cope with additional tariffs as well as another duty rise, which is highly likely to end up full square in the consumer’s lap, bumping up wine prices to an all-time high.

“We are calling on government to clarify their tariff plans now and – in the event of a no deal Brexit – to commit temporarily to imposing no tariffs on wines for at least 6 months. This would be a pragmatic solution with any loses to the Treasury covered by not having to implement a costly new system. It also leaves intact government’s ability to remove tariffs on wine permanently, but as part of a future free trade deal.”

The average bottle of wine has reached £5.73 in the off-trade (Nielsen) and the WSTA estimates that would rise by 20p in the event of a no deal Brexit.

Suppliers across the country are stockpiling wine, with Laithwaites owner Direct Wines bringing in an extra 2 million bottles, which represents a 40% increase. Bibendum PLB is ordering significant extra supply and Majestic is holding an extra 1.5 million bottles.

Simon Doyle, managing director at Concha y Toro UK, told DRN: “We have to be pragmatic and agile and anticipate different scenarios. Brexit is a challenge, but there’s a limit to what we can do in practice. We just have to make sure we have a good inventory. We are bringing a lot more inventory into the UK to help offset any challenges around the March-April period.”

Currently there are no tariffs on wines from the EU, Chile and South Africa. A no deal Brexit would result in the introduction of tariffs estimated to cost UK wine importing businesses over £100 million a year, the WSTA said.

It added that the introduction of no deal Brexit tariffs would represent a double blow for wine businesses after the Chancellor decided to single wine for a duty rise at the Autumn Budget. From February 1, duty on a bottle of wine will go up 7p.

Add a tariff to the duty rise and VAT and this means an average priced bottle of wine, which today costs £5.73, will cost £5.93 in the event of no deal, an extra 53p a bottle more than consumers paid before the referendum result, when an average priced bottle of wine was £5.40. That would all be a result of duty, rather than the industry’s much-touted “premiumisation” agenda.

For sparkling wine, which is taxed at an even higher rate, an average priced bottle currently costing £7.14 will go up 37p to £7.51.

The WSTA also warned that a no deal Brexit would also mean the loss of access to the EU’s Excise Movement Control System which tracks alcohol coming in and going out of the country documenting consignments electronically.

EMCS allows alcohol to and from the EU to be moved on with no extra checks, without it “ports are likely to descend into chaos”.",WSTA campaigning for suspension on wine tariffs as no deal Brexit looms

The Sussex vineyard has joined forces with its neighbour Pookchurch to form a 104 acre estate, dedicated to increasing the production of premium still English wines.

Pookchurch Vineyard is expected to produce an additional 200 tonnes of grapes for the Bolney Wine Estate portfolio, which comprises Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Pinot Meunier, Bacchus and Pinot Gris.

The absorption of the Cuckfield-based vineyard adds another 67 acres to Bolney’s estate.

Alongside this, Bolney is currently approaching the completion of its new winery. The facility, due to open in February, will increase production capacity to more than 300,000 bottles by 2022. Throughout 2019 the vineyard will also focus on developing the estate to welcome a greater number of guests to the site.

Sam Linter, managing director and lead winemaker at Bolney Wine Estate, said: “Merging with Pookchurch’s vineyard has strengthened our business for the future. We’re really pleased to be formally one team. Both Bolney Wine Estate and Pookchurch vineyard share the same outstanding sandstone soils and aspect so there is a lot of potential for new single vineyard wines.

""It’s also an opportunity to increase research, development and benefit from greater economies of scale across the larger vineyard. We are now a significant rural business and employer in the local community”.

David Wood, Pookchurch founder said: “Bolney Wine Estate’s passion and culture are the perfect fit for Pookchurch. We’re delighted to be part of such a renowned brand and dynamic business. This is really exciting period of growth for us, by combining our vineyards we are in a powerful position to grow the brand and facilities across the estate. The merger firmly puts us within the top 10 of English Wine brands”.

New Zealand wine brand Babydoll is set to enter the UK market this year to tap into growth at the premium end.

The brand, which will make its debut at the annual New Zealand trade tasting in London this week, is named after a breed of miniature sheep which keep the grass down between the vines.

To support the plan to accelerate growth in the UK, a consumer lifestyle campaign is planned, aimed primarily at 25 to 45 year-olds and principally female wine drinkers. In recognition of the Babydoll sheep, the campaign is called “Love the Little Things” and it aims to celebrate life’s little moments.

Babydoll wines are from the Awatere Valley sub-region of Marlborough and are made at the Yealands Estate by senior winemaker Natalie Christensen. In the UK the wines are distributed by Enotria & Coe. The line-up for the UK includes Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Rose and Pinot Noir. The wines are sustainably produced and vegan-friendly, priced between £11 and £14.

Christensen said: “After a fantastic harvest we had a feeling this Pinot Gris was going to be something special; really focused, with these amazing lifted aromatics and beautiful concentrated mouthfeel. Receiving the Green Award in addition to the Trophy really sums up what our Babydoll wines are all about – gorgeous, sustainably produced, premium wines from New Zealand.”

Saunders has worked at Bibendum PLB since 1982, and is now the company’s chief executive. He has pledged to use his expertise and extensive contacts to further raise the profile of the drinks industry charity with a particular focus on encouraging an increase in financial support from the wider trade.

During his first speech as chairman, Saunders stressed the importance of consistent support for The Benevolent, and he urged colleagues to become regular donors of the charity as part of his chairman’s challenge. His idea of “buying the equivalent of a drink for The Benevolent every month” will be a consistent message.

Saunders’ two-year appointment as chairman was announced at The Vintners’ Company Annual Lunch in aid of The Benevolent, which took place at Vintners’ Hall on January 11, and was attended by more than 140 senior members of the drinks trade.

Saunders said: “2019 promises to be another important year for The Benevolent and I look forward to playing my part in supporting Chris and his team to both raise awareness of our work and the vital funds needed to enable us to provide the support that is in such demand.”

Chris Porter, chief executive of The Benevolent, said: “What better way to start the year than for the trade to come together at this wonderful event to raise money for a growing number of people in need in our industry? The support given to The Benevolent from the Vintners’ Company, not just with this fabulous lunch, but throughout the year is just fantastic. I am so grateful for it and for the help and relief its proceeds will bring to many of our beneficiaries.”

 Work has already begun on the Thomas Dakin Gin Distillery, a venue which is set to showcase the “rich heritage, craft excellence and entrepreneurial spirit” of both the award-winning Thomas Dakin and the city of Manchester.

The announcement follows the news earlier this month that Manchester Gin also has plans to open a city centre distillery, which will be located under Manchester Central, the conference and events venue. 

 

 The new Thomas Dakin craft distillery will be located in the heart of the city centre between Deansgate and Albert Square. The venue will boast three craft copper pot stills, which will be visible behind the distillery’s striking glass frontage. Alongside the working gin distillery, the venue will include a bar, and an event space for hospitality and entertaining. The venue, which received full planning permission in 2018, will open in early Autumn this year.

 

 The new distillery will continue the legacy of Thomas Dakin, one of the pioneers of the development and refinement of quality English Gin from 1761. The team behind the new distillery plan to combine traditional techniques employed by Dakin himself centuries ago, with pioneering modern methods to break new ground in craft gin.

 

 The Thomas Dakin Distillery is expected to attract 70,000 visitors expected in the first year. It will create more than 50 jobs and will have the capacity to produce over one million bottles of gin every year.

David Hume, director of Thomas Dakin at brand owner, Quintessential Brands Group, said: “At last, it’s happening – the Thomas Dakin Gin Distillery will soon be a reality! As the label on the bottle says, the Thomas Dakin Legacy lives on, but with this new distillery, we’re going to be breaking new ground in craft gin distilling and really championing the great craft heritage that Manchester has.

""Dakin was a true visionary of his day and the distillery will continue Thomas Dakin’s great gin-making legacy, while highlighting to the world the Northwest’s important place in the colourful history of gin.”

Bodega del Abad was founded in 2000 and it has a high-tech winery as well as 35 hectares of vines split between the red Mencia grape and the white Godello.

The majority of the vineyards are at high altitude and some are more than 100 years old.

The Bierzo region of Northwest Spain is experiencing a “surge of popularity” according to Amathus, with consumers showing increased interest in the combination of ripe yet fresh, elegant mineral wines, which are also said to pair well with food.

The region boasts a unique microclimate, a blend of both Altlanctic and Mediterranean continental climates, while the steep slate-soiled hillsides help with the production of high quality grapes.

The producer is one of many newcomers to Amathus’ portfolio over the last 12 months.

Last year started with the addition of Champagne house Duval-Leroy, organic estates Petit Roubie and Chateau La Liquire from the Languedoc and also Mas Cristine and Champ des Soeurs from the Roussillon.

Other additions include Prosecco producer 8cento and from the Northern Rhone Roland Grangier in St-Joseph and Condrieu, plus the organic Laurent Habrard in Crozes-Hermitage. Greek producer Avantis Estate further increased the diversity of the portfolio, as did Addendum Napa Cabernets from the team behind Fess Parker. A range of petit chateau Bordeaux from across the region has also added depth to the range.

Amathus has confirmed it will announce further new listings soon, including those from Spain, South Africa France and Japan. It said the rest of 2019 will also promise a similar wave of new agencies from across the globe as it strives to build a wine range to match its wide-ranging spirits selection.

Amathus head of wine, Jeremy Lithgow MW, said: “What Amathus is building is truly exciting; the route to market established by our diverse spirits agencies alongside our ability to offer a comprehensive wholesale package has given us the foundation to build a wine business with the ability to compete against the more established players in the market.

""Not only are we looking to provide a range of great value every day essentials, but also to offer a diverse range of wines at all levels from quality-driven estates delivering real excitement from all corners of the globe.”

A planning application was lodged in June 2018, followed by an extensive public consultation process, but Falkirk Council has now given the green light to the Rosebank restoration.

Rosebank ceased production in 1993 when former owner UDV (now Diageo) mothballed the site and its maltings were converted into a restaurant.

When the renovated distillery commences distillation it is expected to generate 25 full-time equivalent jobs for the local economy. The opening date is set for Autumn 2020.

The Rosebank Distillery, which is situated on the banks of the Forth & Clyde Canal, hopes to attract 50,000 visitors a year to Falkirk and will offer a wide range of distillery tours with some featuring the last drams of Rosebank distilled prior to its 1993 closure.

Plans for its revival include a new 1,000 metre contemporary and energy-efficient distillery with a production capacity of one millon litres of alcohol a year. The iconic Rosebank chimney will remain in place. There will also be a visitor centre, tasting room, shop and warehouse space.

Leonard Russell, managing director of Ian Macleod Distillers, owners of Rosebank, said: “We’re delighted to have reached this significant milestone of the Rosebank redevelopment project. To bring back to life an iconic distillery and quintessential Lowland single malt is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity.

“Our investment goes beyond production. We’re proud to be investing in Falkirk by adding to the town’s flourishing economy and tourism scene with a new Rosebank Visitor Centre, to help tell the story of this remarkable whisky.

“Rosebank Distillery has a very special place in Scotland’s whisky heritage and we’re committed to ensuring this remains the case. We will strive to replicate the unique Rosebank style by once more employing the unique techniques of triple distillation and worm tub condensers, for which this iconic Lowland single malt is famed.”

Alongside this news, Ian Macleod is purchasing the Rosebank site from its current owners, Scottish Canals.

Russell added: “We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Falkirk Council and Scottish Canals for their support of our vision to revive Rosebank Distillery. The backing from both parties has brought our vision to life and enabled the smooth running of this initial phase of the project. We look forward to continuing these relationships as we progress through the next stages.”

Ian Macleod Distillers also acquired the Rosebank brand and last remaining stocks from former owners, Diageo, in October 2017. The company expects to use this limited Rosebank whisky for a small number of releases from 2019, distilled in the last few years before Rosebank Distillery closed its doors in 1993.

Oddbins has appointed an advisory firm to look at options for the future, following a difficult Christmas trading period.

European Food Brokers Group, which owns the off-licence chain, has warned staff of job losses in the future. The company also owns Wine Cellar Trading and Whittalls Wine Merchants, and the group employs more than 500 members of staff at more than 100 off-licences.

Advisory firm Duff & Phelps, which specialises in administration, is reported to have been appointed.

Oddbins started life in 1963 and it went into administration in 2011. EFB rescued the company, which has 45 stores, buy buying the business and taking it out of administration.

A spokesperson for EFB said: “We have filed a notice of intention to appoint Duff & Phelps as administrators for Wine Cellar Trading Limited, Whittalls Wine Merchant Limited, and EFB Retail Limited.

“The deterioration of the high street, combined with the continuing economic uncertainty surrounding the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, has resulted in an unsustainable, tough, physical retail market.

“We will endeavour to continue to operate all stores as a going concern while options are assessed for the business, including a possible sale. All businesses continue to trade until further notice.

“European Food Brokers Limited and its additional businesses continue to trade and are not part of this announcement.”

Whittalls Wine Merchants 1 Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EFB Retail Limited, trades as Oddbins in England, with the smaller Whittalls Wine Merchants 2 Limited trading as Oddbins in Scotland.

The trade has reacted with sadness and concern to the news that Oddbins has lined up administrators following an “extremely tough” Christmas trading period.

Around 500 jobs are at risk after European Food Brokers, which owns Wine Cellar and Whittals Wine Merchants along with Oddbins, filed a notice of intention to appoint Duff & Phelps to handle insolvency.

It follows hot on the heels of news that M&O Trading, the owner of the Hartley’s and Mulberrys off-licence chains in the southeast of England, has collapsed into liquidation.

It is also less than a year since the demise of Conviviality and the turmoil endured by Bargain Booze and Wine Rack, pointing to challenging times for high street drinks retailers.

According to information seen by prospective buyers, EFB’s drinks retailing business – which includes around 100 stores – made a net loss of just over £4 million in the 18 months to July 31, 2018.

EFB blamed Brexit and the effect it has had on exchange rates for its woes, sparking furious debate on social media.

“The deterioration of the high street, combined with the continuing economic uncertainty surrounding the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, has resulted in an unsustainable, tough physical retail market,” it said. “We will endeavour to continue to operate all stores as a going concern while options are assessed for the business, including a possible sale.”

“High street retail for wine is so tough,” said Dan Kirby, sales and marketing manager at Corkr Fine Wines. “The appetite just isn’t there. It’s either supermarket or super-niche, in my opinion. Not a huge amount of room for middle of the roaders.”

Oddbins began life in 1963 and the estate grew to 350 stores across the country at its peak, when high street drinks retailing was in its heyday.

It was plunged into administration in 2011, when EFB purchased the Oddbins name and rescued a smaller collection of stores from the brink.

The estate now stands at 47 stores, and managing director Ayo Akintola’s plans to return Oddbins to a 300-strong national chain sadly have not come to fruition.

Many consumers confessed they did not know Oddbins was still in existence, as it no longer has nationwide reach.

Trade insiders fear that there could be no way back for Oddbins now.

“If Oddbins go down this time I fear they may not find a new buyer in this difficult high street retail environment,” said Greg Sherwood MW, senior wine buyer at Handford Wines. “Will be very sad. Another route to market potentially closing for many wine producers.”

Ana Sapungiu MW and Jenny Smith have worked hard to source an interesting and eclectic range of wines from across the world over the past couple of years. But the chain has seemingly been battered by exchange rates, which have made trading difficult in an already challenging market.

Is Brexit the route of the problems?

EFB blamed Brexit for its struggles, but Toni Klare said: “Oddbins has been flirting with administrators for years – absolutely nothing to do with Brexit.”

John Lloyd said: “It has nothing to do with Brexit, just bad management.”

Brexiteers found themselves incensed on social media, with one claiming: “What a load of crap. Oddbins, you failed because of tough competition in the market with other independent shops and huge supermarkets competing against you. But no instead, why not just blame Brexit for all your troubles?”

This drew an equally furious response from one Oddbins employee. “I can tell you for sure Brexit has absolutely been the death knell for the company,” he said.

“The company has indeed has it problems but they have been massively exacerbated by Brexit.

“We cannot buy wine for the price we once did. Simple maths. The exchange rate has plummeted since Brexit.

“I’m sure anyone running a business that imports agrees. Couple that with uncertainty on the high street, massively increasing rents, then you have a perfect storm.

“The pound simply does not stretch far enough these days. Plenty companies sell products that are almost exclusively imported.

“How is a company that imports the vast majority of it’s product not going to badly effected by Brexit? We cannot buy wine from Europe, Australia, USA or anywhere for the price we once did.”

There is plenty of debate raging, but many wine lovers in the industry are simply full of sadness and they remain hopeful that the chain can be salvaged and that jobs can be saved.

“A shame especially as Oddbins were such a leading light in the 1990s, especially with their Fine Wine department,” said Roger Jones of The Harrow at Little Bedwyn.

Henry Jeffreys, a former Oddbins employee and now a drinks writer, said: “Really sad to hear that Oddbins has gone under again. A place where so many great people in the drinks trade got their start. And me.”

Peter Richards MW said: “Really hope Oddbins finds a way through this. Top buyers; great wines; iconic brand.”

David Round MW, a consultant and educator, said: “Very worrying news for employees and suppliers. This is only the latest incarnation of Oddbins to run into trouble, but it's exceptionally tough on the high street. Hoping for the best, but fearing the worst.

Another former employee, journalist Jason Evans, said: “Sad to seen the once mighty Oddbins is set to go into administration for the second time in less than a decade. In a previous life I spent many happy years working for the company. At its best it was brilliant.”

Inverarity Morton buyer Toby Sigouin said: “Very sad. I started my wine career with Oddbins, as did many back then. A very tough market these days.”

Vino, the regional wine store chain in Scotland, tweeted: “Holding hands with all the Oddbins team in Edinburgh tonight. Some of us went through the same and for some of them it’s not the first time.”

“Genuinely gutted for good people who are going through this for the second time,” added Jack Witts.

Candice O’Reilly said: “Real shame about Oddbins. They introduced me to a vaster range of wines than all the other retailers put together. Want to make a small fortune out of wine then start with a large fortune.”

Tim Unwin said: “This is so very sad. Oddbins played a hugely important role in educating wine drinkers, especially in the 1980s and 1990s.”

Julie Ashworth added: “They really do have some of the best staff out there. For all the talk of Tesco today [the retailer is to cut 9,000 jobs] and lack of speciality expertise on counters, Oddbins were both experts and enthusiasts.”

James Morris said: “This is a shame. I see small independent retailers as atypical of most off-trade sales in that quality over quantity more of a significant factor. I often see Oddbins in Balham empty but two doors along Sainsbury's plonk filled wine aisle bustling with grab and runs.”

Majestic Wine employee Ed Wright added: “Sad day for the Oddbins family. Hope they can find a way through to continue.”

It has caused many people to reflect on the times they had working for Oddbins at the height of its empire.

Richard Cassidy said: “Sad news about Oddbins. Had such fun working for them back in the 90s. Think I worked in 15 stores. They were always chaotic but it felt like being part of something special.”

Puss Stein said: “This is particularly sad for me as when I was the assistant manager of the Oddbins in Gloucester Road, London, we got a new junior assistant. We have now been married for 27 years.”

Bottle shop Independent Spirit of Bath tweeted: “I remember when oddbins went down the first time. A lot of really talented folks lost their jobs. I hope they find a buyer, there’s some great people working there.”

However, there was less sympathy from importer Leon Stolarski. “Déja vu,” he said. “The previous incarnation went bust owing millions in unpaid bills and tax, and its creditors – mostly wine growers – got back less than 5p in the pound. As a wine merchant, my first rule is to not f*ck my growers over. Sympathy for the staff, yes – but not Oddbins itself.”

Meanwhile, Dan Williams, owner of indie The Bottle Shop in Roath, Cardiff, said: “Oddbins has been a lame duck for over a decade. Greed and lack of care... classic way to lose money and fuck people out of jobs.”

There are now concerns that more household names could struggle after the problems encountered by EFB and M&O Trading, plus online retailer Wine Direct, which has also gone into administration.

One senior buyer at a leading multiple retailer told DRN: “This is just the start. Expect more businesses to go under. People were practically giving away wine over Christmas and conditions are so tough.”

However, it is worth noting that off-trade BWS sales enjoyed strong growth throughout 2018 and then climbed 3.8% over Christmas (Nielsen). A number of independent merchants also reported roaring trading, as did various online operators, so it could be a case of winners and losers in a polarised market in which the middle has been squeezed to breaking point.

The upmarket retailer will enjoy exclusivity of two tiers of Botham’s wines, The All-Rounder and The Botham Series, which start at £7.99 and go up to £10.99.

There is also a top tier, the £30 Sir Ian Botham Collection, and Berry Bros & Rudd took the initial allocation of that when the brand launched last year.

The Botham All-Rounder comprises a Chardonnay and a Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced from various regions across South Eastern Australia.

The Botham Series is the mid-tier range and it takes inspiration from important years in Botham’s career. The 81 Series Barossa Shiraz pays homage to Beefy’s exploits in 1981, when he took five wickets for one run at Edgbaston and went on to produce a magnificent knock at Old Trafford to hand England the initiative in one of the greatest series ever witnessed.

The Margaret River 76 Series Chardonnay commemorates the year in which he made his England debut and his first century. The Coonawarra 80 Series Cabernet remembers the year in which Botham produced arguably the greatest performance of all time. He took 13 wickets and hit a century in Mumbai to lead England to a famous victory, completing the match double in style.

Alexandra Mawson, Australian wine buyer at Waitrose, said: “We’re really excited to be stocking Sir Ian’s new range of wines exclusively at Waitrose. Sir Ian has worked alongside well-known winemakers to personally craft these great quality wines and I am sure they will appeal to cricket and non-cricket fans alike.”

The cricketing legend had a tainted view of supermarkets after he was burnt by a bad experience when he launched a Botham Merrill Willis (BMW) range along with winemaker Geoff Merrill and former cricketer Bob Willis.

He had said he was happy to do business with multiple grocers, provided they could agree on a fair price and agree on a healthy long-term strategy. He has seemingly found the right partner in Waitrose.

The wines will be available in-store and online at Waitrose Cellar from February 4.

Every year the International Cider Challenge recognises and rewards the wide range of superb ciders produced across the world.

We bring together a panel of expert judges and they meet in London to blind taste ciders divided into a number of categories: West Country style, New World style, Spanish cider, naturally sparkling, flavoured cider, perry, pear cider, ice cider, wood aged cider, no and low-alcohol cider and speciality cider.

Gabe Cook, a former cidermaker turned author, consultant and TV star, is the chairman of the challenge. He is also known as The Ciderologist and he brings a remarkable degree of passion and energy to the role.

We caught up with him to find out his thoughts on the 2019 ICC and the cider market in general.

What interesting developments have you noted in the cider world over the past year?

Cider is now officially the fastest growing drinks category in the world, so these are exciting times! Flavoured ciders continue their inexorable march, but there are so many fantastic styles of cider out there. This is why it is so crucial to have appropriate categories that separate out all these differences, based upon the apple/pear variety used, the cider making methodology and what type of additional flavour (if any) has been added.

The last 12 months have seen continuing developments with in the cider category, notably the emergence of low/no alcohol as an increasingly important consumer proposition. The finer side of the cider spectrum has also seen considerable growth, albeit from a smaller base. Naturally sparkling, including full methode traditionelle, ciders are tapping into the trend for sparkling drinks, such as a Prosecco, and are now being made and consumed around the globe.

Has there been an increase in international cider producers?

New cider makers are emerging all over the world. In cider's traditional heartlands of North West Europe, a number of cider makers have established themselves with very specific consumers in mind, whether they be wine drinkers, craft beer quaffers or cocktail fanatics. Elsewhere in the world where there is less of an old heritage, cider makers have been popping up left, right and centre - a demonstration of cider's continued growth and importance. In the last year I have seen cider makers become established in Brazil, Chile, South Africa, The Netherlands, Vietnam and India. That said, the UK still retains the greatest volume of cider production, and indeed, won the greatest number of Gold medals at the 2018 ICC.

Why is the International Cider Challenge important to this thriving drinks category?

The ICC retains its crucial place in the global cider calendar. This competition is the barometer of what is hot and not in the world of global cider making. It also provides a great platform for brands to gain exposure to the wider retail marketplace. By selecting judges across the spectrum of cider interaction – makers, journalists, retailers and distributors – the ICC acts as a platform to further empower the drinks trade with knowledge of the cider category and championing cider excellence.

How do you see your role as chairman?

I am exceedingly proud to have been asked to be Chair of Judges for the ICC once again. Nothing fills me with more pleasure than listening to a room full of passionate cider folk debating the merits of a range of ciders from all over the world. But most crucially, my role is to ensure that the best International cider judges have been selected and that they are fully briefed on the requirements of the judging process, with a particular focus on ensuring they are judging each cider to the appropriate style. I very much hope and expect 2019 to be the biggest and best ICC so far.

The gin has been created using grapefruit peel, all hand-picked by the distillery team, which is added to the botanical basket before being vapour-infused with all Rock Rose Gin’s traditional botanicals. It is then lightly-sweetened with muscavdao sugar.

Old Tom Gin is described as “the missing link” between the heavy Dutch Genever style and the more modern London Dry Gins, and was once available in most bars in the country. This historic gin style is now being distilled for the modern palate, to create a sweeter and lighter gin for those less attracted to the more juniper-based dry gins.

Martin Murray, Co-Founder, said: “This extra special edition of Rock Rose Gin derives from our popular ‘Design a Rock Rose Gin Label’ competition of 2016, which became the wonderful citrus-based Artists’ Edition. As a very limited batch, it sold out very quickly and we were soon inundated with requests to recreate the fabulous gin.

""We’ve believe we’ve improved it even further and created the most refreshing gin in our portfolio. We hope our signature bottle, now in hues of pink, will also make it appeal to the gifting market.”

The newcomer will be available from January 31, priced at £34 for 70cl.",Rock Rose gets a pink grapefruit Old Tom Gin

One of the challenges highlighted by many on the panel is that the current method of categorising rum as either white, gold or dark, is not an accurate system.

Nicholas King, WSET spirits educator and product development manager, said: “This white, dark and gold categorisation; it doesn’t make sense. It does for most consumers but we need to find a way of dealing with that problem.”

Sly Augustin, owner of Trailer Happiness, said: “When I see rum described as white or dark, personally I think this means nothing, but is this the most damaging thing for the rum category? It just means we have to start from scratch.

“I think the most confusing aspect about rum is when we ask, what are our objectives?

“Whisky has a personality. Your average whisky doesn’t have any external aspects of theming.

“With a lot of rum bars you have to have parrots and palm trees and all the gimmicky stuff.

“I lead with the quality of the product and understanding what the consumer wants. It is a slow process but if we focus on the quality of what we are offering then people will be engaged.”

POS and labelling information for rum was also discussed.

John Vine, Waitrose’s spirits buyer, said: “People can have too much information and that can make it over-confusing for customers.”

At Waitrose recently there has been a big focus on producing accurate and clear tasting notes for each spirit, and ensuring the flavour profiles are communicated.

And when it comes to labelling, Imie Augier, general manager, Merchant House, said: “If you could read a label and understand it better - even understanding that different levels of abv can impact the taste - that would be some progress.

“Labelling is good at the moment but I think it could be better. If everyone was on the same page it would be much better.”

King said that for rum educators the best method is to break the category down in terms of style, because there are only a certain number of options available to producers.

He explained: “You have raw material, you can run your fermentation in different ways, you have a choice at distillation and choices post distillation. Those are the main options that will get you to the end result.”

William Borrell, who founded Polish craft vodka Vestal, and who claims to specialise in turning underground public conveniences into neighbourhood bars, created the drink to tap into the growing interest in reducing alcohol intake. Willow was created in his venue called the ‘Ladies & Gentleman’ bar in Kentish Town, north London, and it is named after the founder, combined with the word 'low'.

Borrell said: “There’s obviously a boom in no/low alcohol spirits. I don’t have much time for most of the former, as I think the notion of no-alcohol ‘spirits’ is a con - especially as the prices are outrageous and the production methods opaque. To be frank, I’d rather just buy a decent soft drink. However, there’s clearly a role for low-alcohol spirits - and Willow’s designed for those wanting all the cues of alcohol with a depth of taste.”

Willow is made from a combination of a Calvados base, along with a blend of pineapple, star anise, cherry tomato, kaffir lime leaves and agave syrup.

The drink can be enjoyed neat or over ice, or with tonic.

Borrell described the drink blended with tonic as being “like a Gin & Tonic meeting an Aperol spritz, paired with the love child of a Negroni”.

Winchester Distillery is to launch its interpretation of an authentic Old Tom Gin, a style that was popular during the 18th and 19th centuries that is growing in popularity.

Old Tom Gin, often used as the base for Tom Collins and the Martinez cocktails, initially came about after the creation of the Dutch spirit, Genever, but before the lighter Dry Gin.

Distillers Paul and Dom have pot-distilled six traditional botanicals – juniper berries, liquorice roots, coriander seed, bitter orange peel, angelica root and calamus root – with 96& abv spirit (as required by EU law). This is then blended with a malt spirit created at the distillery, which has been double distilled in pot still Persephone. The elevated levels of liquorice root in the botanical mix create an earthy, sweeter-tasting spirit, typical of the Old Tom style.

The 40% abv Hampshire Fine Old Tom Gin is available in 70cl bottles for £36.95 from the first week of February.",Winchester Distillery adds Old Tom Gin to its line up

The advert, entitled Race Car, features the Thatchers ‘spokesperson’ first introduced in the Somerset cidermaker’s 2017 Hot Air Balloon ad. It follows an unexpectedly slow race car driving through some iconic West Country landmarks.

The message to viewers is that Thatchers is totally uncompromising about the quality of its cider. You wouldn’t settle for a race car that could almost race, so why buy a cider that’s almost perfect, the company said.

The 30 second commercial will be first seen on ITV during the Six Nations Rugby England Vs Ireland match on February 2 at half-time. It will then be shown from February through to September on ITV, Channel 4 and Multichannel, during this year’s top sporting events and TV moments, with hero spots to include The Grand National, Monaco Grand Prix, Game of Thrones and the Great British Bake Off.

The ad also runs in cinema during July and August, including the silver spot in the hotly anticipated new Quentin Tarantino Film – Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.

Yvonne Flannery, Head of Brands at Thatchers Cider commented: “This new phase of our award-winning campaign features our popular spokesperson, as well as cameos from Martin Thatcher and our chief cidermaker Richard Johnson. Filmed in iconic West Country locations, it retains a gentle, warm-hearted yet funny tone, and leaves the viewer with no doubt as to the taste and quality of Thatchers ciders – what cider’s supposed to taste like.

“Following from our Hot Air Balloon commercial, which we know resonated strongly with viewers on enjoyment and memorability, Race Car creates a long-term campaign for Thatchers, filmed in the same, sunny photographic style, and featuring familiar faces, music and scenery to support brand recognition.

“Of course, the notion that the race car is going so slow is clearly ridiculous, as was the low flying hot air balloon in the first of the ad series. This is a humorous ad that will appeal to a wide audience and introduce new customers to our brand.”

Johnnie Walker’s tie-up with hit series Game of Thrones helped push sales up 14% for Diageo GB for the last six months of 2018.

The results, for the six months to December 31, 2018, reflect a strong second half of the year, with a good performance from a number of Diageo’s key brands.

The company said Johnnie Walker sales grew by 6% driven by the launch of the limited-edition ‘White Walker by Johnnie Walker’, in collaboration with HBO and Game of Thrones, which was released in the UK in October 2018. The launch resulted in sales of one bottle a minute on Amazon UK in the first 24 hours of it being available.

Other brands in the portfolio also performed strongly.

Dayalan Nayager, managing director, Diageo Great Britain, Ireland and France, said: “We have experienced a very strong half in GB, with net sales up 14% and our key brands, including Guinness, Tanqueray, Gordon’s and Smirnoff, all performing well.”

The continued popularity of gin in the UK is reflected in strong sales for both Tanqueray and Gordon’s, which both delivered double-digit growth over the last six months.

In beer, Nayager said Diageo GB is outperforming the category,

He said: “Guinness delivered net sales growth of 6% and increased its market share, driven by a strong performance from Hop House 13 lager. In December, Guinness was announced as the new title sponsor and official beer of The Six Nations from 2019, reinforcing the Guinness brand’s position as one of rugby’s biggest supporters.

Smirnoff also performed well over the period, aided by summer activity for the brand.

“Smirnoff returned to growth with net sales increasing 4% despite the category being in decline in GB3. It also cemented its position as the UK’s biggest spirits brand. Summer saw the launch of the ‘Smirnoff Soda Smash’, which encouraged consumers to put a modern twist on the classic vodka and soda.

“We’ve seen a host of exciting activations by our brands over the half. The Guinness Open Gate Brewery opened its doors in London, giving consumers a chance to sample some of Guinness’s unique and innovative beers. We showcased seven of our Reserve brands at London Cocktail Week in October, which saw around 25,000 people attend, and the Baileys Treat Bar Christmas Pop-up returned to London for a second year in a row.”

Diageo GB’s performance is reflected in similar results for the overall parent company for its total global sales.

Diageo reported that half-year net sales grew 5.8% to £6.9 billion, while operating profits rose 11% to £2.4 billion.

The global drinks giant said it would buy back £660 million worth of shares, bringing the total buyback programme to up to £3 billion for the year ending June 30. It recently sold 19 brands to Sazerac for net proceeds of approximately £340 million after tax and transaction costs.",Johnnie Walker's Game of Thrones whiskies help drive sales growth for Diageo GB

Justerini & Brooks has added Bierzo producer Bodegas y Vinedos Raul Perez to its wine portfolio.

Winemaker Raul Perez began winemaking at his family estate Castro Ventosa before branching out and experimenting with his own projects in 2004. Perez is a widely respected viticulturalist known for his innovative and collaborative nature, and his continuous drive to protect historic vineyards in Spain’s northwest, according to Justerini & Brooks.

The UK fine wine importer will offer two Bierzo ranges, Ultreia and La Viscaina de Vinos, with access to the tiny-production bottlings from Ribeira Sacra: El Pecado and La Penitencia, and a white from Rias Baixas: Sketch Albarino.

Ultreia takes its name form the pilgrims’ greeting used on the Camino de Santiago, which passes through the Bierzo region. In this range Justerini & Brooks will offer an everyday red Mencia called Saint Jacques and a Godello. These will sit with a premium, single expression Ultreia de Valtuille; a deep, red Mencia-based wine from old vines in the Valtuille de Abajo village in the heart of the Bierzo region.

La Vizcaina reflects Bierzo’s varied and complex soil types and the quality of its old vines. The climate in the region is fresher and has more Atlantic influences, resulting in wines with a delicacy and brightness, along with qualities for “graceful ageing”.

The La Vizcaina project is comprised of single hillside vineyards with plantings of various local varieties, including Bastardo (Trousseau), Garnacha Tintorera (Alicante Bouschet), Godello and Dona Blanca.

Mark Deaing, Justerini & Brooks’s Spain buyer, said: “Raúl Pérez is a bona fide winemaking icon and his ever-evolving range is one of the most consistently exciting in Spain. His arrival brings a new, innovative edge to our Spanish portfolio and we can’t wait to get going.”

Perez said: “I’m absolutely thrilled to embark on a new partnership in the United Kingdom with Justerini & Brooks. J&B is an historic importer in the UK with a fantastic trajectory and I’m very much looking forward to us working together for many years to come.”",Justerini & Brooks to distribute Raul Perez wines in the UK

The UK has signed a trade deal with Chile to ensure continuity between the two countries once Brexit finally takes place.

The government name checked the Wine & Spirit Trade Association at the top of its press release, declaring that the deal protects a large chunk of the UK wine industry.

WSTA chief executive Miles Beale said: “It is imperative for the UK wine industry that trade with Chile remains undisrupted. In the last 12 months UK consumers bought the equivalent of 105 million bottles of Chilean wine with sales worth some £720 million. That amounts to about 9% of the total UK still wine sales by volume and 8% by value.

“The agreement avoids unnecessary tariffs which will ultimately save consumers money. Without this agreement tariffs added to wine from Chile coming to the UK would cost industry an estimated £9.2 million.”

The government said certainty around the deal would further strengthen the trading relationship between the UK and Chile, which grew 11% to £1.8 billion in 2017.

UK manufacturers benefit from preferential access to the Chilean market to sell their goods, and UK consumers benefit from lower prices on Chilean goods, such as wines, fruits and nuts and other products.

Trade in goods and services between the UK and Chile has grown by 9% per year on average since the agreement was provisionally applied in 2003. UK exports to Chile have grown by 16% on average each year and a total increase of 351% since the agreement was provisionally applied.

The agreement also protects intellectual property rights and maintains preferential market access for trade in services.

International trade secretary Dr Liam Fox said: “Today we have signed an important trade continuity agreement as we prepare to leave the European Union. This will ensure there is no disruption to British business exporting to Chile after we leave the EU and will mean consumers continue to benefit from low prices and more choice on supermarket shelves.

“Our trading relationship with Chile continues to go from strength to strength, with exports rising over 20% to almost £1 billion last year. This free trade agreement will allow trade to continue as freely as it does currently and will help to strengthen our trading relationship even further.”

Chilean ambassador Jamie Bowden added: “The UK and Chile enjoy a long-lasting trade relationship. The UK is still working to achieve an agreement with the European Union on the terms of our departure. The success of those talks will determine whether the current EU-Chile agreement ceases to apply to the UK at the end of March this year, or at the end of an implementation period.

“In either scenario, the agreement we have signed today means that there will be no disruption to UK-Chile trade as the UK leaves the EU.”

The new UK-Chile agreement is designed to replicate the existing trading arrangements as far as possible. It will come into effect as soon as the implementation period ends in January 2021, or on March 29, 2019, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.

The government said it will sign a number of other arrangements in the coming weeks.

Concha y Toro is the largest supplier of Chilean wine to the UK and it has enjoyed strong sales growth over the past few years. UK general manager Simon Doyle recently told DRN: “We have to be pragmatic and agile and anticipate different scenarios. Brexit is a challenge, but there’s a limit to what we can do in practice. We just have to make sure we have a good inventory. We are bringing a lot more inventory into the UK to help offset any challenges around the March-April period.”

Fears that business would be impacted could be assuaged by news of this deal.

It was interesting to note that, in its press release, the government stressed the importance of protecting the UK’s wine industry, which contributes almost £19 billion to the UK economy supporting around 190,000 jobs. It comes after the Treasury singled wine out for a clobbering at the last Budget, despite the WSTA continually pointint out how many jobs the industry supports and the economic contribution it makes.

“The duty rise is coming into play at the end of February, which is a huge frustration for wine, to be called out for very special, negative treatment by the Treasury,” said Doyle. “We have to work on that. The WSTA do a good job. As an industry we need to do more to demonstrate the benefits we give to UK manufacturers. We pack up a lot of wine in the Northeast of England, a region that needs a lot of investment. We need to be a bit more proactive as wine producers, working alongside the WSTA, to get these messages out more assertively than we have in the past.”",Chilean wine category to benefit from new trade deal

English and Welsh winemakers produced 15.6 million bottles last year, a huge increase on the 6 million that the frost-ravaged 2017 harvest yielded.

The previous record was 6.4 million bottles in 2014 and last year’s crop was 147% up on that year.

Wines of Great Britain chairman Simon Robinson said that 2018 will go down as the year that the English wine industry came of age. The vast majority of production took place in England, although Wales is growing its footprint too.

“2018 will probably be best remembered for the quality of the crop that was harvested here,” he said. “We had ideal growing conditions throughout the year, providing a very high quality crop, but also an exceptional volume crop.”

Almost 1.6 million vines were planted across England and Wales in 2018, up from 750,000 in 2016 and approximately 1 million in 2017.

Wines of Great Britain expects that the 2019 figure will “comfortably exceed the 2 million mark”. It estimates that the number of people employed by the industry rose from 2,000 in 2017 to around 3,500 in 2018. That figure is projected to increase to 24,000 by 2040.

“The industry is not only offering great career paths and creating many job opportunities, but providing a significant boost to rural employment and the local economy,” said Robinson.

HRH The Duchess of Cornwall joined him at an event to celebrate the success of the British wine industry at Vintners’ Hall in London last night.

She became president of Wines of Great Britain after gaining a love of wine from her father, Major Bruce Shand, who was a wine merchant.

Her Royal Highness said: “Since becoming president of Wines of GB in 2012, I’ve witnessed our wines going from strength to strength, in quantity, and even more importantly in quality. Our winemakers have been winning international prizes, and I’m happy to say, beating our French friends on many occasions.

“Our winemakers make a huge contribution to tourism in this country. There are now over 500 vineyards in the UK and 200 of them receive visitors.

“More and more people can now appreciate wines grown in Great Britain, and in these times of uncertainty that can only be a good thing.”

Robinson, owner of Hattingley Valley in Hampshire, added: “Our industry is going through seismic change.

“In 2018, English and Welsh wines also won more awards than Champagne at the International Sommelier Awards, the first time that’s ever happened. A female winemaker from England was acclaimed as the International Sparkling Winemaker of the Year at the International Wine Challenge, breaking the very long-held tradition of this award always being male and nearly always being from Champagne.

“Sales of GB wines continue to grow both here and overseas and based on current trends are projected to increase to some 40 million bottles per annum by 2040. Almost every UK multiple retailer now stocks English and Welsh wines and domestic sales through retailers and restaurants are set to grow, as are sales direct from vineyards and online.”

He also noted that two Champagne Houses, Taittinger and Pommery, have now invested in the English wine industry and endorsed its potential. “Exports are close to my personal heart,” he said. “Within the next 20 years, we expect that exports will account for between 30% and 40% of the wine produced in England and Wales.

“My own vineyard is already achieving 30%, so it can be done. We export to the USA, Japan, Australia, China, the EU and many other countries, and this will be especially valuable after Brexit, if it ever happens.

“Our industry is going through an exciting period of change. The arrival of two Champagne houses – Taittinger, who have purchased 170 acres in Kent; and Pommery, with 100 acres in Hampshire – is an enormously strong endorsement for the future of our industry.

“Will we see additional interest from overseas? Undoubtedly. Is this a positive direction? In my view, unquestionably. Will Wine GB support these new investors? With open arms.

“Expertise, capital investment, access to global markets through existing distribution chains, marketing capabilities and technical excellence will all help to raise the capability and profile of our industry throughout the world.

“In my view the future of the industry is extremely bright. I only wish I was on the other side of 40 years old to observe the progress as it is made.”

This year the scholarship programme, which was first launched in 2004 to celebrate the life of Prestige Retail Manager Ian Murray, is being launched on Murray’s birthday to make it “even more poignant”, according to the producer.

Jill Murray, representing Ian and the Murray family, said: “Ian was a great champion of young people, encouraging them to be the best that they can be and to not be afraid of reaching for their own ambitious dreams.

“He was also brilliant at sharing his passion for whisky and took great delight in encouraging an appreciation of it.”

Applicants are shortlisted by Ian Murray’s colleagues and Grant Family members, before one candidate – an 18 to 30 year-old working in an off-trade spirits retail environment – is selected to embark on a bespoke 12 month programme, which includes WSET Level 2 training, a presentation skills course, an educational distillery visit, and expert development of the spirits category, in particular malt whisky.

The 2018 award went to Anna Rogan (pictured above), of Luvians Bottleshop in St Andrews. She said: “The skills I have gained in the past year have been invaluable in every aspect. The WSET and Presenation Skills courses have vastly improved both my knowledge and confidence, whether I am leading a tasting or just chatting to a fellow whisky lover. I also loved having the chance to meet Ian’s wife Jill, touring Glenfiddich with her and hearing stories about Ian and his adventures in whisky. I am hugely grateful for the experience.”

Trading has been temporarily suspended at winedirect.co.uk and justincases.co.uk, both of which are owned by Fermentation Ltd.

The parent company has gone into liquidation and it appointed Stephen Evans and Hugh Francis Jesseman of Antony Batty & Co as joint administrators on January 17.

A statement on Wine Direct’s website said: “The joint administrators are currently assessing the options available in respect of a sale of the company’s business and assets and in the meantime trading has been temporarily suspended.”

The Wine Direct online business was originally launched by Sainsbury’s in the mid-1990s. It invested heavily in the site but in the early 2000s it pulled out, according to a source.

The domain name was subsequently taken on as a joint venture between Andrew Birtley, Fermentation Ltd’s managing director, and Peter Rehbury, owner of Hailsham Cellars, but Hailsham Cellars no longer has any connection to Wine Direct and Andrew Birtley’s role as a director at Hailsham Cellars is believed to have ended a couple of years ago.

Many customers have taken to Trustpilot.com to vent their anger about Wine Direct’s demise. A number of complaints suggest that the business has been unable to satisfactorily complete orders for several weeks.

Earlier this month, Andrew Dickson said the service was “very poor” and delivery was promised on four separate dates. He added: “They eventually let slip that they didn’t even have the wine in stock. I was promised a refund but that didn’t materialise either. Luckily I’d used my credit card and the card company dealt with my issue quickly. Avoid WineDirect!!”

Drew Keith said he was charged six times for an order that didn’t turn up, while another said the company only got one star on TrustPilot “because there’s no zero option”.

James Hubbard tweeted: “Can’t say I am surprised given the utter ineptitude of their customer service. Truly shocking. Nonetheless I feel for any staff impacted and hope they have found, or find, alternative employment very soon.”

An industry source told DRN: “The people who offer wine online only need to offer something unique and they weren’t, so they were only able to compete on price, but they just didn’t have the margins. We have seen before with Slurp and I think others will follow in time.”

Customers with outstanding orders are advised to contact their payment provider in the first instance in respect of refunds and any claims should be notified in writing to Antony Batty & Company LLP, Swan House, 9 Queens Road, Brentwood, Essex CM14 4HE for the attention of Steve Marshall.

Chief executive Mark Lansley told DRN: “Broadland is a wine company, but we have been investigating various different avenues of growth.

“We are growing nicely, with about 15% growth this year, but I have been looking at low and no-alcohol-type drinks, and particularly ones with social benefits.

“Over the past few years there have been different types of positioning in drinks and we think that, given our skills in bottling and in different production techniques, we are in a good position to explore these.”

Lansley said that, with his background as a chemical engineer, he also has experience in fermentation, distillation and infusion. He has worked in the dairy and beer industries and in soft drinks. He also spent 10 years at Glaxo Smith Kline.

He added: “With Broadland’s branding skills as well we felt we could start to develop several products where we partner with different groups and produce drinks that have social benefits.

“We are starting by coming up with an ethos that will define the business. These will be the rules that we will live by within that company and from that the line of drinks we could produce will come one at a time.

“Often someone starts off with a product and then builds the company around it, but we are approaching this in a different way.

“I think society is moving, not just in the environmental field. There is a sort of ‘live kindly’ movement, where people want to leave a small footprint on the world. A lot of people are looking for more meaning in terms of products and how and where they are sourced and in terms of the companies they wish to buy from. That’s the direction we are heading in.”

Lansley said there are no time limits for this venture and the company is in talks with a number of charities at the moment. The drinks will be alcohol-free or, at most, 0.5% abv.

He added: “There are lots of naturally occurring substances and ingredients that one can leverage, and different production techniques that can create certain taste profiles and different mouthfeels. There is a whole array of natural and functional ingredients that are not yet being used in drinks.

“We can then marry this up with good brand development to identify target customers and target demographic groups in order to give them something better.

“There’s quite a movement in the 20-30 age bracket where people are looking for something quite different

to what’s on offer. We are conducting market research in this space and from that we can develop the product.

“We are coming at this from a consumer needs perspective. We are digging out unmet needs and giving those consumers something different.”

The deal will see Seedlip become the official supplier to the reigning FIA Formula One World Champions, while Seedlip cocktails will be served in the team’s hospitality at all Formula One Grands Prix.

The “designated driver” positioning has historically been dominated by soft drinks producers, with Coca Cola Enterprises (CCE) in particular running campaigns offering free drinks for designated drivers, particularly around the festive season.

Seedlip’s news follows a move last July by Heineken, which launched a £6 million campaign for its alcohol-free beer Heineken 0.0, with the aim of “making alcohol-free beer cool”. The series of adverts included “Now You Can: Parking”, which featured a man enjoying its Heineken 0.0 while driving his car.

Ben Branson, Seedlip’s founder, said: “We are honoured to partner with Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport and together provide a global platform for the designated driver. With a shared commitment to innovation and technical excellence we are incredibly excited to work together throughout the F1 season.”

Toto Wolff, team principal and chief executive at Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport, said: “We have signed a number of new partners recently, underlining that Formula One remains a leading marketing platform for companies to drive brand development and business growth.”

The SITT Spring tastings - which take place on February 25 at The Principal, Manchester; and on February 27 at the Royal Horticultural Halls, London – are designed to help independents from the off and on-trade to connect with specialist wine importers.

To fit in with the “low-intervention” theme, wines featured at the Spring events can be organic, biodynamic, natural or “simply hand-crafted with as little intervention as possible”.

SITT founder, Judy Kendrick, said: “This topic is more than a trend: today every retailer and restaurant needs to offer their customers some of these types of wine. It is no longer just restricted to the organic specialists. This low intervention theme is important for everyone.”

The tasting event will feature a raft of low-intervention wines and alongside this there will be a panel debate at 12pm to 1pm on “Low Intervention Wines and the Benefits to your Business”.

This debate will be chaired by long-standing importer of organic wines, Jerry Lockspeiser, who will lead a panel of experts including winemaker David Baverstock of Esporao, Frederick Grappe from Dynamic Wines and Piotr Pietras MS, SITT’s on-trade Ambassador.

After this there will be a masterclass called “Tasting: Soalheiro” from 13.30 to 14.40, which will including a vertical tasting of some of Luis Cerdeira’s iconic Alvarinho wine (represented by Raymond Reynolds).

Cerdeira took over the company from his father in 2006, and in this masterclass he aims to show attendees how Vinho Verde can age using four different vintages to illustrate this, showing the “new face of Portugal”. The theme for the SITT Spring 2019 tasting will be demonstrated in this masterclass via a range of classic and low intervention wines, chosen to demonstrate the versatility of Alvarinho.

The final masterclass of the day is “Tasting: Bouchard Finlayson Verticals”, which takes place between 15:00 to 16:00.

At the Bouchard Finlayson vertical tastings (represented by Seckford Agencies), Lia Poeda, Bouchard Finlayson’s global brand ambassador, who is also a French ex-sommelier and buyer; will present a vertical tasting of both Galpin Peak Pinot Noir and Hannical, unique red blend of Italian/ French varietals (going back to 2004) from this South African boutique winery in Hemel en Aarde. Povenda will show attendees how these wines can age and why they should be a consideration for retailers or wine lists.

Confirmed producers for SITT Spring include Weinwurms, presented by third generation winemaker Georg Weinwurm. This year the producer will be introducing its Zweigelt Ried Schilling from Weinviertel, Austria.

New releases this year will include a Rioja Gran Reserva “22 Barricas” from Las Bodegas, which is described as a “complex blend of Tempranillo, Graciano, Garnacha and Mazuelo”, which then spent 30 months in new French oak, and a minumum of five years ageing in the bottle.

Seckford Agencies has a new launch from New Zealand (John Forrest, 2018 Vine Whisperer SB) and South Africa (Darling Cellars, 2016 Old Bush Vine Cinsault).

Marta Vine has five newcomers to introduce, including organic and vegan Vergel rose and white wines, while Quixotica has wines from Castilla and Leon, described by Jancis Robinson as “one of the best wines in Spain”.

Wines from Bouchard Finlayson, Soalheiro, Esporao and Dynamic Vines will also be available to taste at SITT.

Kendrick said: ""If you want your shelves filled with wines that you can't find on the high street then SITT is the place to come and find them. If you want suppliers who are experts in working with independent retailers, then again SITT is where you'll find the best specialist importers, altogether in one place. If you are time poor, and need to juggle managing the shop with buying and making contacts I can assure you that SITT will be the best day's busines you'll have all year.""

The SITT events will take place between 10.30am and 5pm (5.30pm for the London event), and there will be Autumn tastings in London and Manchester in September.

English Spirit has unveiled a new look across its full portfolio of spirits and liqueurs.

The small batch distiller’s portfolio includes 14 spirits and liqueurs, alongside a number of seasonal one-off products. These have now all had a complete update for the first time in the brand’s eight-year history, in order to visually align the drinks and to deliver common design elements across the full range.

Changes have also been made to the labels in order to showcase product details on the front of each bottle. Labels now explain how the drink has been made and key ingredients are highlighted, along with tasting notes and serving suggestions.

James Lawrence, general manager at English Spirit, said: “At the heart of English Spirit is the desire to focus first and foremost on the quality of our products, so we wanted a look that is both classic and unfussy, and which hero’s the contents of each bottle. The portfolio has been given a simple and elegant refresh, that communicates the personality of each individual drink, while bringing them together as a collective.”

Two new bottle sizes have also been added to the range.

English Spirit was founded by former Oxford biochemist Dr John Walters in 2001 and it became one of the first distilleries in the UK to produce its own vodka and the first to make rum from scratch. It remains the only UK distillery producing sambuca.

The independent wine and spirit merchant has taken on the UK distribution for Sea Change, a range of environmentally-conscious wines – developed by 10International – that actively support ocean conservation by pledging donations from sales to charity.

In addition, no plastic is used in the finished product and bottles are deliberately lightweight to help minimise emissions. The bottles us a Nomacorc Select Green closure, which is made from renewable plant-based polymers. Label stock is a mixture of grape waste and materials from FSC-certified forests.

With every sale of the Sea Change Chardonnay and Negroamaro, 25 Euro cents will be donated to Plastic Oceans UK and Sea-Changers, which work not only to raise awareness of the impact of plastics in the sea but also to reduce that effect through beach clean-up and supporting conversation efforts.

Toby Sigouin, wine buyer for Inverarity Morton, said: “When I first caught wind of this project, I immediately signalled it as something we wanted to back. It is such a well-considered, well-judged proposition in the face of a very real environmental crisis. The statistics on plastic pollution in our seas is alarming and these wines, which are excellent quality at a very affordable price point, will help stimulate both conversation and action. We intend to do justice to this great cause.”

Sea Change Chardonnay is described as having a “well-balanced structure and a soft, delicious finish”, while the Negroamaro is “a versatile easy-drinking delight”.

Bestway has reaffirmed its commitment to making a success of high street drinks retailing amid challenging times for this sector of the market.

The firm swooped in to save Bargain Booze and Wine Rack from the jaws of oblivion after Conviviality collapsed last year, safeguarding hundreds of jobs.

Since then it has been a tumultuous time for the high street as a result of rising business rates and exchange rate pressures brought about by fears surrounding Brexit.

Oddbins has been plunged into administration, along with sister businesses Whittalls Wine Merchants and Wine Cellar, while Hartley’s and Mulberrys owner M&O Trading has fallen into liquidation.

Philip Duffy, administrator for the Oddbins estate, said rising business rates and rents were having an effect on the high street, while consumers are tightening their purse strings as Brexit looms and exchange rates have taken a battering.

“Traditional bricks and mortar retailers are undoubtedly feeling the strain,” he added.

Franchisees at the Bestway Retail business have voiced their concerns to DRN, but the firm insists it can flourish in this challenging marketplace, and it wants to reassure franchisees of its commitment to bricks and mortar drinks retailing.

Dawood Pervez, managing director of Bestway Wholesale and Bestway Retail, told DRN: “We knew that 2018 would be a tough year, but we are 100% committed and there are some building blocks that we wanted to put in place following the acquisition of the Bestway retail network.”

He pledged to drive higher margins and rewards for franchisees through investing in infrastructure and marketing and growing its retail estate in 2019.

Nielsen stats show that sales at Bargain Booze are down over the past year, but that is to be expected as some stores were shut and shelves were barren while Conviviality scrambled to find a buyer.

Some franchisees have had to leave the business, forcing buyers to negotiate with suppliers on slightly declining volumes. Wine Rack’s head of retail, Haydn Hicks, has also vacated the role and he now plans to devote his time to making a success of his own Bestway franchises.

There were fears that the flagship store in Belsize Park, London, would be closed, but Bestway confirmed it will remain open and it voiced its desire to grow the Wine Rack estate going forwards.

Bestway Retail managing director David Robinson recently left the business to take up a new role as chief operating officer at Pets at Home. It has now brought in Andy Creswell, who left his most recent role as managing director of service station operator MRH in August 2018, to replace him.

Creswell has not worked directly in the off-licence sector before, but he is a retail veteran and he brings plenty of experience in mid-sized co-ops, forecourts, convenience chains and grocers to the table.

He is enthused about the challenge of thriving in the current climate and he believes Bestway Retail is well placed to do so.

He told DRN: “Our Bestway Retail buying team has delivered a strong performance, increasing retailer margins over the past eight months through improved buying prices on key lines, which is an important step in delivering a strong future.

“Additionally, we have further invested in the rebates available to franchisees through our reward scheme, to drive customer loyalty and encourage upsell on volume. Our Bargain Booze consumer-facing social media platforms and loyalty scheme continue going from strength to strength and we have further dynamic plans for 2019, which will be revealed in the months ahead.”

Salience Search Marketing recently rated Bargain Booze as the UK’s second best drinks retailer when it comes to its social media offering.

Bestway clearly had a huge job in trying to turn around a business that had been left in a somewhat chaotic state. Bestway Retail reported a pre-tax loss of £267,000 on sales of £80.5 million for the three-month period encapsulating the Conviviality deal to its end of year on June 30. Its first job was to shore up supply for franchisees and it has since set about stabilising the business.

Some franchisees have expressed concern at the situation the business finds itself in, although their complaints largely stem from Conviviality's handling of the business and they still hope that Bestway can turn it around by making changes.

“The people at Bestway head office are nice people, but they haven’t got the calibre of buyers that Bargain Booze once had,” said one. “The buying is not good enough and volume is not being harnessed properly. They are still being run as separate businesses. There’s an ongoing flow of a reduction of store numbers. They are negotiating on declining volumes. There’s no reason why it won’t continue to decline. People are getting fed up and they are not seeing any change.

“Bargain Booze was not in the greatest shape when they bought it. We are getting on for a year now. You can get away with it for a while if there’s something coming over the horizon that’s going to turn it around, but I can’t see what’s coming over the horizon.”

Yet Creswell insists there are plenty of initiatives coming over the horizon and that franchisees will benefit by committing to Bestway Retail.

“We remain wholly committed to ‘bricks’ and to the growth of our drinks estate, and with Bestway’s skill and growing focus on digital pathways to improve customer experience, we will also be looking at how we can complement the high street infrastructure, and drive further value-add into the business through incentivising increased footfall into the stores as a win-win for our franchisees, and importantly, for their own customers,” he said.

“Certainly, 2019 is going to see more movement in the high street. We have further plans, which will be unrolled across the year, which includes investment in our brands and in our Bestway retail estate.”

As for Oddbins, industry insiders fear there will be no saving it this time, eight years after it was last plunged into administration. It began life in 1963 and the estate grew to 350 stores across the country at its peak, when high street drinks retailing was in its heyday. EFB purchased the Oddbins name and rescued a smaller collection of stores from the brink in 2011, The estate now stands at 47 stores, and managing director Ayo Akintola’s plans to return Oddbins to a 300-strong national chain sadly have not come to fruition.

“EFB bought that businesses eight years ago and they have never been able to scale it up, so you are left with, in the scheme of things, a small estate,” said an insider. “The 47 stores are spread very thinly, it is not getting bigger and its wine-led offering has been eaten away by everyone else.

“You cannot over-emphasise the effect on the market of The Co-op getting its act together. Their expertise, the scale they have got in alcohol buying, that will filter down to Nisa and Costcutter, so you’ve got 5,000 stores, and that’s an awful lot of stores. When you have got 47 Oddbins stores spread from Aberdeen to London, it’s hard to compete. Aldi and Lidl have gone big on wine too. Everyone else is eating away.

“It has been hit by business rates. You can see how something can go from being profitable to marginally profitable to falling off a cliff.

“Oddbins always pitched itself as selling odd stuff you can’t get anywhere else, but all of a sudden everyone is doing it. There are highly specialised local merchants with a good online offering, the Co-op has got its act together and business rates are increasing – it’s a perfect storm.”

A source in the City said Oddbins might appeal to some buyers with a love of wine, but added that in commercial terms high street drinks retailing is a difficult sell. The administrator could be forced to close the stores down, or talk to managers about buying their stores, as we saw when Thresher collapsed.

“If Oddbins go down this time I fear they may not find a new buyer in this difficult high street retail environment,” said Greg Sherwood MW, senior wine buyer at Handford Wines. “Will be very sad. Another route to market potentially closing for many wine producers.”

Despite the woes of Oddbins and M&O, the off-trade appears to be in rude health. BWS sales enjoyed strong growth throughout 2018 and then climbed 3.8% over Christmas (Nielsen). There are clear winners and losers, and if Oddbins cannot be saved that volume should be swept up without too much damage to the wider trade.

EFB blamed Brexit for its struggles, which caused pro-leave commentators to rail against it. But one Oddbins employee said: “I can tell you for sure Brexit has absolutely been the death knell for the company. The company has indeed has it problems but they have been massively exacerbated by Brexit. We cannot buy wine for the price we once did. Simple maths. The exchange rate has plummeted since Brexit.”

Ketel One Botanical is described as a new spirit distilled with botanicals and infused with natural fruit essences. The drink has a lower abv of 30% and only 82 calories per serve.

The producer said the launch is set to “revolutionise the market by establishing a new sub-category”, by appealing to consumers looking for a more balanced lifestyle and tapping into growth in the no and low alcohol drink sector. The signature serve is Ketel One Botanical Spritz, with the drink mixed with soda water and finished with a fresh garnish.

Bob Nolet, 11th generation master distiller at the Nolet Distillery, said: “As it becomes clear that consumers want better drinking options, Ketel One Botanical and the Ketel One Spritz offer a thoughtful choice for consumers looking for something new from their summer serve.

“We’ve watched the gin category boom in recent years, introducing new and herbaceous flavours. Premium vodka continues to grow alongside this, currently up 6.2% by value with innovation driving this.

“We see Ketel One Botanical playing a key part of this on-going evolution, targeting inquisitive consumers open to trying new flavour combinations and we’re delighted to be introducing something really exciting to the market.”

Ketel One Botanical is produced using Ketel one Vodka, which is blended with the Nolet family’s botanical recipe and re-distilled in small batch copper pot stills at the Nolet Distillery. The vodka is then infused with naturally-extracted essences of fruits and botanicals to create a 30% abv spirit. It comes in three flavours: Grapefruit & Rose, Cucumber & Mint and Peach & Orange Blossom.

A raft of wine regions will be represented at the London Wine Fair for the first time this year, while other countries are increasing their footprint at the event.

The Douro is taking a generic pavilion at the fair for the first time, along with Greece, Slovakia, The Basque Country and Belarus.

Meanwhile Wines of Germany and Italy will be increasing the space they take at the fair, with Italy’s footprint boosted to include more producers from the Prosecco Consorzio.

Wines of Georgia has confirmed it is to return for 2019, following its first show in 2017, and ViniPortugal said it is bringing 36 producers all looking to export to the UK for the first time. They will exhibit within the Wines Unearthed zone.

Head of London Wine Fair, Hannah Tovey, said: “So far we are seeing most of the growth in booking coming from international exhibitors, specifically Old World regions. We see this as really significant, given that the show will take place less than two months after Brexit may well have become reality.

""European wineries will be out in force looking to trade with the UK – many of them for the first time. Despite the uncertainty, the UK remains an important and mature market for many wineries, especially those which are targeting the high end on-trade and independent sectors.”

A number of key agents have confirmed they will be returning to the fair this year, including Buckingham Schenk; Felix Solis Avantis; and Carson Wines. Ehrmanns will exhibit for the full three days, which is the first time since 2014, and Condir Wines, Barton Brownsdon & Sadler and Broadland Wineries will all expand their presence significantly this year.

The London Wine Fair 2019 will take place between Monday 20 and Wednesday 22 May.

Simpsons’ Wine Estate and Roberson Wine are working together to launch four new English still wines.

Charles and Ruth Simpson from Simpsons Wine Estate will launch the four prestige still wines this year, and the wines will be distributed in the UK via the team at Roberson Wine.

The four wines are all named after interesting local roads that surround the vineyards and winery in Barham, Kent, to help emphasise the sense of provenance.

The wines are: Gravel Castle Chardonnay 2018 (the ‘early release’ baby brother of Simpsons’ Wine Estate’s Roman Road Chardonnay); Derringstone Pinot Meunier 2018 (the team believes this may be the UK’s first Blanc de Noirs still Pinot Meunier and it is sealed under the Vinolok glass closure); Railway Hill Rose 2018 (a Provencal-style rose, created from 100% Pinot Noir, also sealed with Vinolok); Rabbit Hole Pinot Noir 2018 (created from low yielding still wine clones 115 and 375).

These four new wines will be joined later in the year by the Roman Road Chardonnay 2018, which will now age for 12 months prior to release.

Talya Roberson, MD, Roberson Wine, said: “Simpsons’ Wine Estate is just the partner we’ve been looking for. Their still Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are produced from Burgundian clones grown in chalky soils and sit perfectly alongside our award-winning portfolio of great wines from France and California. We are looking forward to introducing them to the trade this spring.”

Ruth Simpson, co-owner of Simpsons’ Wine Estate said: “2018 was an incredible year for us at Simpsons’ Wine Estate and we’re thrilled to be working with the team at Roberson Wine to launch our new premium still wines.

""We are both quality-driven, family businesses that are passionate about English wine, so we share many commonalities. Roberson Wine has a fantastic list of prestige customers in the wine world and we look forward to introducing our exciting new wines to their exclusive client base.”

Château Minuty, situated just outside Saint-Tropez, was acquired by Gabriel Farnet in 1936. The Matton-Farnet family have completely revamped the estate over the past 80 years, even earning the prestigious Cotes de Provence ‘Cru Classe’ status in 1955.

Today the third generation Jean-Etienne and Francois Matton continue to restructure the estate’s vineyards, from which they hand-harvest low yields of traditional and local varieties such as Tibouron, Rolle and Grenache. Chateau Minuty is one of the few remaining estates in the Cotes de Provence to harvest exclusively by hand.

Berkmann’s purchasing director, Alex Hunt MW, said: “Anywhere that’s anywhere in Provence these days features Château Minuty’s exquisite roses. Berkmann Wine Cellars is the champion distributor of Provence rose and this is a great new string to our bow.”

Château Minuty’s co-owner, François Matton, added: “We at Château Minuty are immensely proud to be entering into this new partnership with Berkmann Wine Cellars. Being a family-owned and run company like ourselves, we share very similar values.

“Like us, Berkmann Wine Cellars is a leader in their field. They have proven their ability to build brands in the UK drinks industry, particularly in the on-trade, which is the natural positioning for Château Minuty wines.”

Kerabrum was previously group head sommelier and wine buyer for Caprice Restaurants Group and Birley Clubs. Before moving to London he spent 13 years with chef Alain Ducasse as group beverage director after he trained in France at Dinard Food & Beverage School.

In his new role he will be responsible for souring and management of fine wines within the Berkmann portfolio while building Berkmann’s tailor-made offering for collectors and private customers.

Kerambrun said: “Since the beginning of my career in hospitality, I’ve always had the opportunity to work with some major players in the industry like Alain Ducasse and Richard Caring. Changing the direction of my career was not a simple decision but it is certainly easier as I stay in this exciting and vast world of wine and especially when joining such a respected company in the industry.

“Both Berkmann Wine Cellars and I share the same values and it's an honour to have the opportunity to create the culture and ethos of this new department, that sits within the Berkmann family’s vision.

“One of my goals is to keep the company one step ahead of the competition by delivering the best service to our clients. As always, I will analyse each wine by its notoriety, pleasure and price.”

He will join the company on May 1, succeeding Rooney Anand, who previously announced he would step down at the end of the financial year.

Mackenzie joins from Merlin Entertainments, where he is responsible for the Midway portfolio of attractions, including 100 businesses around the world such as Madame Tussauds, the London Eye and SeaLife centres. He has also worked with Bass and Allied Domecq as acquisitions director.

He was part of the executive committee at Merlin and he is also an independent non-executive director of northwest brewer, Daniel Thwaites, a role he will relinquish before taking up his executive role at Greene King.

Philip Yea, Greene King’s chairman, said: “After a comprehensive search we feel that Nick’s broad experience and track record at one of the world’s leading leisure businesses as well as his knowledge of the pub business, early in his career and more recently as a non-executive, make him the best candidate to lead Greene King through its next phase.”

Mackenzie added: “Greene King is a very strong business with a great portfolio of pubs and beer brands and a real commitment to its customers, staff and shareholders. I am looking forward to working with my new colleagues to deliver on our vision to be the best pub company and brewer in Britain.”

The chain’s owner, European Food Brokers (EFB), said Brexit and the resulting economic uncertainty, along with poor high street sales over the Christmas period, were to blame for the situation. EFB’s other brands – Whittalls Wines Merchants and Wine Cellar Trading – are also affected.

Duff & Phelps is the administrator that has been called in to keep the business running while a buyer is sought out.

Philip Duffy, joint administrator, said rising business rates and rents were having an effect on the high street, alongside the fact that consumers are tightening their purse strings as Brexit looms.

He added: “Traditional bricks and mortar retailers are undoubtedly feeling the strain.”

Around 500 jobs are now at risk, across the three drinks retailer chains.

Just last month M&O Trading, the owner of Hartley’s and Mulberrys off-licence chains in the southeast of England fell into liquidation, while in the same month online retailer Wine Direct also went into administration.

However, although many high street retailers struggled over the festive season, overall off-trade BWS sales enjoyed strong growth throughout 2018 and grew 3.8% over Christmas (Nielsen).

Portuguese DO wine imports to the UK grew 33.7% in value throughout 2018, driven by a 34% increase in volume sales.

ViniPortugal - the trade body for Portuguese wine - also attributed the growth to ongoing education projects with sommeliers and independent retailers, which it has been investing in since 2008.

Marketing director, Sonia Vieira, told DRN: “I think it was really important that we decided to do this back in 2008, and now we are just really starting to see the results of this work. We have more than 250 grape varieties in Portugal and our expertise is in doing blends, so it is essential that sommeliers and retailers can give consumers advice about Portuguese wines as it isn’t easy. We will continue to invest in these channels.”

The growth in Portuguese imports comes from the still wine sector, although Port is still an important category for the country.

Within still wines, Vieira said that over the past five years white wine sales have grown particularly well in the UK, although the bulk of imports from Portugal are still red wines.

She said: “The UK consumer is interested in other varieties. They want to know more than just Touriga Nacional. We have seen an increase in popularity of a number of varieties, such as Arinto, which is very well balanced and with good acidity. These wines match well with a number of things.

“I believe it is easier for the consumer to look for regions that they recognise but for the long-term we will continue to invest a lot in education and training to highlight the differences and the qualities of our grape varieties. We are definitely now seeing the results of that project coming through.

“Consumers want to surprise their friends and share experiences and they are increasingly curious about these native grape varieties. Portugal has all of these treasures and so now it is about creating and sharing the experience around these varieties.”

Vieira said that ViniPortugal plans to invest the same amount in the UK as it did last year but for 2019 there will be more of a focus on consumer events.

She said: “We will do more consumer festivals and partnerships, and not just our own events. For our annual Wines of Portugal tasting in the UK we ran a consumer event at the end of the day for the third year running. At this event for 2019 we focused more on producers that already have a presence in the UK, as we want consumers to be able to find the wines they try at the tasting.

“We will also have a presence at the London Wine Fair in the Unearthed Wines section, and at that event we will be bringing over 34 producers who aren’t currently in the UK, and who are seeking distributors. Alongside that we can focus on masterclasses.

“And over the next few years we will be spending more on consumer events in general.”

The initiative is designed to promote one of France’s most exciting wine producing regions, which is beloved by many indies due to its versatility, innovation and price to quality ratio.

Languedoc Rousillon is the world’s largest wine-producing region and it boasts a wide range of whites, reds, rosés, sparklers and naturally fortified wines.

The promotion month is June 2019 and it is free to take part. It has proved successful for many cavistes in France and we are now launching it in the UK to benefit our independent readers.

Sud de France will send you a POS pack to help you showcase your participation in le Printemps du Languedoc and highlight your Languedoc Roussillon wine range, with the aim of driving footfall and sales uplift in a really important category for indies.

It is an opportunity to get behind one of France’s most dynamic regions and excite your customers about the quality and diversity of styles coming from the Languedoc.

“This wine region represents a symbol of modernity, diversity, identity and the Mediterranean art of living and is therefore a great category for wine merchants such as yourself to be able to offer to your customers,” said Isabelle Kaanan, executive director at Sud de France.

We will provide promotional materials and digital support via the Drinks Retailing News social media channels, newsletters, and website.

We leave it up to you to decide how to highlight Languedoc Roussillon wines during the promotion, but this might include in store and online tastings, winemaker visits, or tasting flights of top quality Languedoc wines.

The retailer that runs the most effective promotion will win a trip for two to the region.

The deadline for registration is April 25. Contact lee.sharkey@agilemedia.co.uk to sign up to Le Printemps du Languedoc and we will send you the POS pack.

Paula Lindenberg, president, ABInbev UK & Ireland, said: “Our UK business achieved double-digit top line growth in 2018, with strong performances from our global brands, craft portfolio and Bud Light.”

She said Stella Artois was “the fastest growing beer brand in retail last year”, while Budweiser was “the top contributor to category growth in the off-trade over the summer”.

Stella Artois sales were aided by the brand’s continued partnership with iconic sporting events like Wimbledon and its new Joie de Biere advertising campaign. The producer also rolled out a Gluten Free variant last year.

Budweiser, the Official Beer of the FIFA World Cup, had its new addition to the portfolio last year: the alcohol-free Budweiser Prohibition. In addition, the producer said 42% of Budweiser off-trade shoppers over the summer were new to lager completely.

Lindenberg said: “Our third global brand, Corona, continues to grow consistently year-on-year, thanks to its premium positioning, iconic lime ritual and its pledge to protect paradise from marine plastic pollution – a cause that we’ll be investing even more in this year.

“We also expanded our low-alcohol beer portfolio, as part of the burgeoning consumer trend for moderation and our Global Smart Drinking Goal of no-alcohol and low-alcohol beer forming 20% of our volumes by 2025.”

Lindenburg also noted the producer’s craft and speciality brands also had a good year, and she highlighted strong performances from Camden Hells Lager, Camden Pale Ale and Goose Island IPA.

She also said the company has “big ambitions” for Michelob Ultra in the UK. ABInbev brought the brand over from the US in October last year.

Looking at ABInbev’s global results, the company reported revenue growth of 4.8% with pre-tax profits up 7.9%. It said approximately 8% of its global beer volume in 2018 was no and low-alcohol and it will continue to increase its focus on global health and wellness trends.

The wine will be created with Invivo Wines and the project, which Parker describes as “a collaborative process”, will lead to two wines which will be launched this summer.

Parker said: “I am a true wine lover and I love including wine in family dinners and occasions with friends, so this is a very exciting and fun project for me. I am so looking forward to every single stage of the creation process. I intend to be very hands-on throughout, as I am with all my endeavours, and could not be partnering with a better brand than Invivo.”

Invivo was co-founded by Tim Lightbourne and Rob Cameron, who claim they wanted to make unpretentious wine their friends would enjoy drinking. The pair successfully raised money via two rounds of crowdfunding, and they now sell in 16 countries worldwide. Invivo is also the team behind Graham Norton’s wine and recently-released gin.

This latest collaboration is not a celebrity endorsement, according to Invivo. Parker will be involved in every aspect of the making of the new wine, from naming and label design to the winemaking itself, and choosing the final blend. Parker is also a shareholder in the company, making this a long-term venture for both parties.

Parker and Invivo have chosen a New Zealand winery for this project, and the first two wines to launch will be a Sauvignon Blanc and a Rosé.

Cameron, who is also Invivo’s winemaker, said: “We want this wine to be 100% Sarah Jessica Parker. So other than selecting the case wines for a Sauvignon Blanc and Rosé, I will be taking a back seat and letting her create the blends. It comes down to SJP’s palate and preferences. We want to create wines that she truly loves and wants to drink and share with friends.”

Lightbourne said: ""The partnership with Sarah Jessica feels like a perfect fit. We didn't want to be a silent partner or just a familiar face - we wanted someone who will throw themselves into the process and make wine that's all about them and reflects their good taste. We can already see this happening and can't wait to taste the end product.""

The craft brewer, which is already well-established in Sweden, is now ready to bring its best-selling brews to the UK market, to be distributed by Proof Drinks.

The range comprises six beers: A Ship Full of IPA (5.8% abv), which is the best-selling IPA in Sweden, according to the brewer; A Ship Full of IPA Non-Alcoholic; Tail of the Whale (4.8% abv), described as “a unique German wheat ale”; Cirrus Cloudy Lager (5.1% abv); an organic unfiltered cloudy pilsner lager; Hale to Nothing (4.5% abv), an organic and unique twist on the traditional English pale Ale’ and Session Pale Ale (3.5% abv), an aromatic lower alcohol pale ale.

Brutal Brewing was created in 2011 and the beers were officially launched at Craft Beer Rising 2019. Further beers will be added to the series later this year.

Jane Peyton, beer writer and drinks expert, said: “Brutal Brewing’s A Ship Full of IPA Non-Alcoholic is one of the best non-alcoholic beers on the market. It has great flavour, body and drinks like a beer with alcohol in it. Delicious, satisfying and very moreish.”

Craft beer in the UK continues to thrive. More than 400 craft brewery businesses opened in the UK in the 12 months to December 31, 2017, and craft beer sales are reported to have grown at around 90% in the past year. Craft beer’s market share in the UK still remains much lower than in the US (5% compared to 23%), indicating there could still be room for further growth in the UK.

The new packaging, which highlights the wine is certified organic and vegan friendly, is supported by a new strapline ‘Green to the Extreme’. The revamped packaging is also eco-friendly across the label, bottle and closure, and it is 100% recyclable.

Girelli said: “We have worked on Purato for the last ten years, well before organic could be considered mainstream. We are genuinely committed to producing wines which have the least impact on the environment as possible and which are a direct reflection of their terroir – we have certainly not jumped on an organic bandwagon! Our aim with the new look is for Purato to become easily recognisable on the shelf as organic and fully sustainable – in other words – green to the extreme.”

There are three wines in the Purato range, each priced £8.99. These are: Cataratto/ Pinot Grigio Terre Siciliane IGP; Nero d’Avola Sicilia DOC; and Rose Terre Siciliane IGP (made from Nero d’Avola).

Purato is distributed by North South Wines. Buying director, Joy Edmondson, said: “Purato is an incredible asset to our portfolio as it is sustainable under so many aspects. With organic wine sales in double digit growth (24% in 2017, according to the Soil Association 2018 report), and Italy performing very well across all trade channels, we are confident it will perform well for our customers.”

Carlos Alves, Sogevinus Fine Wines’ Port winemaker and master blender, said: “We are so fortunate here at Kopke to be custodians of these very old and rare wines and we feel we have a duty to safeguard this legacy for future generations.

“Although delicate, this port is quite versatile and is the perfect match for either a fine almond tart, or an apple crumble, or even paired with a blue cheese, foie-gras, scallop gratin or prawn tempura.”

Larkin Wines, a boutique Napa winery which specialises in premium wines priced around £70 per bottle, is set to launch a range of canned wines in the UK.

Larkan was created to fulfil a gap in the market for very premium canned wine, and the producer hopes it will extend drinking occasions for the super-premium category, incorporating festivals and sporting events.

Distribution will be via James Hocking Wine, the new specialist boutique Californian agency, which launched in the UK last month.

Larkan Napa Valley White 2017 is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier and Roussane; Larkan Napa Valley Red 2017 is a 100% Merlot; and Larkan Napa Valley Pink 2018 is a 100% Pinot Noir from Carneros.

Grapes have been sourced from the same small plot vineyards used for Larkin bottlings. The cans will retail in the UK at £9.99 for 37.5cl. Target sectors include specialist wine merchants, speciality food and drink retailers and event caterers.

Sean Larkin, winemaker and owner, said: “The idea for Larkan came about when I was at the beach with friends and we had no wine due to the no glass policy. I started researching alternatively-packaged wines already on the market, and quickly realised there was no offer within the super-premium category.

""It was pretty clear that putting top notch Napa Valley wine in a beer can might be divisive – and certainly a little crazy – but I genuinely free there is a significant market potential.”

Larkan will launch at the Essential Californian tasting on March 12 in London.","Larkan aims to fill gap for ""very premium"" canned wine"

The Islay-based distillery will get a new visitor centre by 2020. The new ‘brand home’ will also feature a café and retail space, and it will be positioned along the shoreline with views overlooking Bunnahabhain Bay and the Sound of Islay.

As part of the overall upgrade, a number of the original buildings will be carefully restored to give them a new lease of life, while others will be removed or relocated to create more space. The six cottages alongside the distillery will eventually be used as holiday accommodation.

Derek Scott, brand director for Malts at Distell International, said: “Our investment programme, here at Bunnahabhain, is about improving the operational side of our distillery for the long-term future. We are restoring our buildings to their former glory and providing a visitor experience where we don’t just welcome visitors, after the long winding journey to get here, we help them enjoy a piece of Bunnahabhain life.

“The plans aim to make the navigation of the site much easier for the visitor and to, in simple terms, declutter it. This will ensure the buildings are more efficient from a storage point of view and located in better suited, more accessible locations to the production buildings. Furthermore, we are committed to reducing the environmental impact of the works.

""The whisky industry is starting to be more environmentally aware and our achievement of recycling over 99% of materials shows, with a little bit of extra effort, it is remarkable what we can achieve.

“Bunnahabhain has a special place in Islay’s whisky heritage and we are committed to retaining this by turning Bunnahabhain Bay into a world-class whisky destination of choice. As the most remote and northerly distillery on the island, our transformation will give those who have made the journey time to pause, forget about the rest of the world and enjoy the serene surroundings.”

Distell owns four single malts and a number of Scotch brands across three distillery sites. The distilleries include Bunnhabhain on the Isle of Islay; Deanston in Doune, Perthshire; and Tobermory, based on the Isle of Mull.

James Hocking Wine will specialise in boutique, family-owned wineries from California and other selected North American regions, and it will aim to sell to high-end independent wine merchants, wine-focused restaurants and private clients.

Hocking has sourced a selection of wineries, spanning affordable “by the glass” price points through to top-end wines, many of which have rarely been seen outside of California.

The portfolio will include one estate which is exporting to the UK for the first time – Oak Farm Vineyards -along with another (Larkin Wines) which is returning to the UK after a ten-year break.

Oak Farm is a Lodi-based estate, owned and operated by the Panella family. It is sustainably-managed and the range includes a Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and a red blend (Zinfandel, Petite Syrah and Barbera). Prices for these wines start at £14.99.

Larkin Wines is a boutique Napa winery set up by Scotsman Sean Larkin. Larkin specialises in Cabernet Franc, alongside Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and a small quantity of Chardonnay. The rrp for the Cabernet Franc is £69.

Hocking said: “Over the last 18 years, I have seen the U.K. market’s steady rising demand for premium Californian wine. Over the last two years, the growth has been substantial at both the top end, where wines sell for around the £60 plus mark and at the more affordable end where there is a strong market by-the-glass in the on-trade.

""These are the focus price points for the new company. In terms of sourcing, Napa and Sonoma wineries will dominate, but I am also keen to explore other up and coming exciting regions of California as well as other North American AVAs.”

Damien Jackman, California Wine Institute’s Trade Director UK & Ireland, said: “JHW is a welcome addition to the U.K. wine trade, particularly for supporters of Californian wine. James’s commitment to, and knowledge of, Californian wine is long established in this market and we have always enjoyed working with him to drive the California category forward, and to learn from his extensive experience.”

The JHW portfolio will include Amala Springs; Benovia; Ferrari-Carano; Larkin; Mandolin; Moone-Tsai; Oak Farm Vineyards; Talley; Waterstone; and Whitehall Lane. Small parcels from cult wineries, such as Kistler, Dana Estates, Occidental, Ovid and Scarecrow, will also be available.

He felt that the drinks industry is “antiquated” and he set about creating an online trading community that uses “smart technology” to bring it into the modern era.

Spiritrade is just two weeks old and the firm claims to have already signed up 40 wholesalers, retailers and brand owners.

Potential members of this community are vetted to ensure they comply with regulations before they can access to the exchange. All stock is verified before a transaction completes and all funds are held in escrow.

Once verified, members can upload offers and access the latest offers their peers have created. All trades are live and are conducted in a negotiation area, with users able able to purchase stock outright or make a bid on available items. All trades are entirely anonymous and Spiritrade covers spirits, beers, champagnes and non-alcoholic beverages.

“Spiritrade aims to revolutionise and modernise the drinks industry,” said the firm. “Spiritrade has combined trading and technology, in order to offer members increased revenue streams and greater reach to global markets, all whilst maintaining safe industry standards.”

Metta was the co-founder of online retailer 31Dover and its supply business, Vanquish. Parent company DMD Ventures recently reported that turnover grew 98% to reach £11.9 million in the 2017/18 financial year. It received 242,000 orders, up 42%, from an increased customer base of 130,000 shoppers, and it claims to be the UK’s leading online drinks retailer for shoppers aged 24-35.

New York Wines will make a guest appearance and this year’s tasting of Oregon and Washington State Wines in London.

The event, which takes place on March 14, will feature 20 New York Wines for the first time, marking the first time the three states have collaborated together on UK soil.

Sam Filler, executive director, New York Wine & Grape Foundation, said: “We couldn’t be happier to be joining with our friends from Oregon and Washington to give people a sneak peek into the world of New York wines. From some of our finest Riesling and Rosé, to our quintessential Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, we’re proud to be showing a variety of wine from three of our major AVAs.”

The “walk around” tasting will present an opportunity for visitors to taste wines from Oregon and Washington, comprising a combination of wineries with existing UK distribution alongside a number of wineries seeking importers. In total there will be more than 40 wineries represented, pouring more than 300 wines.

The agave-based spirit has been growing in popularity among bartenders, spirits aficionados and independent merchants in recent years, and Waitrose recently decided to introduce it to a wider audience.

Now Berry Bros spirits buyer Rob Whitehead has opted for an independent brand called Pensador as he aims to capitalise on the trend.

“It’s been almost 10 years since we took on our first tequila, and since then we’ve seen a slow but consistent growth in the category,” he said. “The numbers are still small, but it’s something people are interested in, and every brand we’ve listed has performed well. The time felt right for a mezcal.”

The off-trade tequila category was worth less than £20 million in 2018 (Nielsen) and mezcal is only a fraction of the size.

However, it is a trendy category and it can be enjoyed like rum or malt whisky, as a luxurious, complex, sipping drink, while it also makes a great base for cocktails.

Londoner Ben Schroder founded Pensador in 2016, sourcing the liquid from a distillery in Mexico’s southern Oaxaca region.

Master mezcalero Atenogenes Garcia uses Espadin and Madrecuishe agaves and produces the mezcal in the traditional method, involving an underground pit oven, a horse-drawn mill stone natural air-borne yeast fermentation, and fire powered copper pot stills.

 The estate production runs are just 400 litres per batch, and it is distilled twice and bottled at 48% abv.

A 50cl bottle has an rrp of £42, and Schroder has already gained listings with Harrods and Fortnum & Mason, plus high-end London bars such as Dandelyan, The American Bar at The Savoy, and Soho House.

“I’m really pleased with Pensador,” added Whitehead. I could have chosen a bigger brand, but the category is still fairly open, and Pensador passed my inviolable first hurdle – Is it good to drink? I’m excited to introduce our customers to the brand and I’m looking forward to expanding our agave range further in the future.”

Pensador pays homage to the distillery’s location on the Calle Pensamientos, but it also means “thinker” and aims to remind consumers to “take it slow and think about what they are drinking”.

Schroder has established a company called Meanwhile to distribute the brand.

Majestic Wine has announced a 49% rise in sales at its French outlets as UK consumers turn to “Booze Cruises” to stockpile wine before Brexit deadline day.

The wine retailer said sales for February 2019 resulted in the biggest-ever month outside of Christmas for its two Calais-based stores.

The ""Booze Cruise"" phenomena was common in the late 1990s as many British drinkers took advantage of savings ranging between £2 to £5 per bottle of wine.

With the Brexit deadline day of March 29 now looming, it appears that stocking up on wine is back in fashion although Majestic said the Booze Cruise shopping mission has changed.

Joshua Lincoln, managing director at Majestic Wine, said: “This is a new generation of cruiser millennials. It is couples getting ready for their summer weddings now. It is day-trippers from the Scottish Highlands taking on a mammoth trek. It is not necessarily people buying as much as they can, as cheaply as they can.”

Majestic has a deal on pre-orders of wine whereby it offers to pay the costs of crossing the Channel, and the retailer notes that while the exchange rate is “far from as favourable as the Booze Cruise peak of the late nineties"", an average saving of more than £3 per bottle still makes it a compelling option.

As an example, Majestic’s Calais stores offer Codorniu Brut Cava NV Spain at £3.29 per bottle, compared with £9.99 in its UK stores.

Lincoln said: “Pre-orders are up 78% for this March and the average order value is up too – these are wine lovers spending the same as they would in the UK, and getting considerably better bottles for it. And they are doing it now.”

The changes would allow zero-waste Brighton restaurant Silo to extend into London, and Silo founder, Doug McMaster, would be able to host workshops in a newly-created space next to the restaurant.

Crate’s founders, brothers Tom and Jess Seaton and Neil Hinchley, have turned to Crowdcube to help raise funds for expanding the business. In addition to Silo the plans include 1,000 sq ft of ""affordable workspace"" designed as an incubator for small businesses. A micro-brewery for small batch brews and experimentation is also part of the plans.

The company achieved £3.95 million turnover for the full year of 2018, with pre-tax profits of £88,000. Throughout 2018 it sold 1 million pints of beer and 120,000 pizzas through its Hackney Wick headquarters.

Crate was founded in 2012 with the aim of creating “the ultimate craft beer and food experience”. The brewer has recently secured a national listing in almost 1,500 stores and it is seeking funding to extend its reach across the UK.

Its crowdfunding pitch states: “We wanted to create a place where people would come and be free to enjoy themselves – to drink, eat, dance, connect and share in an environment that was stimulating and fun. We opened Crate, a micro-brewery and pizzeria, producing full-flavoured and accessible beer alongside hand-rolled pizza.

""We now have the chance to turn our already wonderful space into a true mecca for craft beer fans and a proper hub for creativity.

""Your investment will allos us to add a brewery for experimentation and innovation where we can let creativity run wild; open a restaurant with dishes inspired by a new culinary thinking; open an events space and launch a year-round programme of cultural events; transform our taproom from 4,000 to 8,000 square feet; and build 1,000 square feet of affordable workspace to act as an incubator for talent.

He joined the firm as a shift brewer in 2016 after securing a first class honours degree in brewing from Heriot Watt University.

In August 2018, he became the world’s youngest master brewer after completing a four-year course at the Institute of Brewing and Distilling.

Now the 28-year-old has taken the top job at Greene King, becoming just the 17th head brewer in its 220-year history.

Managing director Matt Starbuck called him “a highly knowledgeable and capable brewer, passionate about brewing with an exceptional technical ability and flair for innovation”.

There are just 578 master brewers in the world and O’Hara is by far the youngest. He is already sharing his knowledge and training apprentices at Greene King.

“It’s been a lot of work to reach this level but well worth it,” said O’Hara. “I’ve enjoyed the challenge and love to continue to develop my knowledge. I had no idea I was the youngest doing the course.”

Since joining Greene King, he has developed a new Heritage range, created Yardbird pale ale and brewed a gluten-free variant of Old Speckled Hen.

He takes over from Craig Bennett as head brewer.

It is all change at Greene King after long-time chief executive Rooney Anand announced he would leave the role at the end of April.

Nick Mackenzie has landed the high-profile role and he will take over on May 1 in a bid to continue the work Rooney has done.

He joins from Merlin Entertainments, where he is responsible for the Midway portfolio of attractions, including 100 businesses around the world, such as Madame Tussauds, the London Eye and SeaLife centres. He has also worked with Bass and Allied Domecq as acquisitions director, so he has plenty of industry experience.

He is also a non-executive director at Daniel Thwaites, but he will relinquish that role before taking over at Greene King. He pledged to deliver on the firm’s vision of being the best pub company and brewer in Britain.

 The London-based Genesis will be the exclusive UK agent for the producer.

Tinto Negro was created as a result of the long-time friendship and professional collaboration of Alejandro Sejanovich and Jeff Mausback, who were colleagues at Bodega Catena Zapata for almost 15 years.

Sejanovich, vineyard director at Catena, had extensive, first-hand experience growing Malbec. His detailed knowledge of the top vineyards in each region means Tinto Negro wines are made from only the best fruit each area has to offer.

Mausback is the wine education director for Catena, and he has travelled the world preaching the gospel of the unique character of high altitude Malbec from Mendoza.

Jorge Crotta became a partner in the management and winemaking team in 2013. He spent three years with Bodega Selentein and the next seven at Catena Zapata developing its international business.

Genesis Wines sales director, Neil McAndrew, said: “As the latest exciting addition to our expanding portfolio, we are absolutely delighted to take on the UK distribution for Tinto Negro. We will be officially launching the partnership at our upcoming Spring Portfolio Tasting on March 13, at the Royal Thames Yacht Club, with Jorge Crotta flying in specially to showcase these stunning wines.”

Buying director, Olivier Marie, said: “Tinto Negro’s wines impressed me from day one with their striking freshness and complex array of aromatics. Their varietal character is always evident and, at times, extremely pronounced, but what I mostly admire is their ability to showcase with such precision their geographical differences.”

The Co-op is continuing its focus on different wine formats with the addition of a new 50cl bottle of Rioja Reserva.

Producer Ramon Bilbao’s new 50cl format – part of its El Viaje de Ramon range – is available now to the UK off-trade, and it secured an early listing with Co-op stores.

The El Viaje de Ramon collection is an off-trade range, which was launched late last year. It was designed to offer the first step on a consumer’s wine journey (viaje) through the “progressive, innovative side of Rioja”. Chief winemaker Rodolfo Bastida focused on accessible, fruit-forward styles and the range also comprises a 75cl ‘clarete’ pale pink Rosado (£8.99) and the 50cl El Viaje de Ramon Reserva 2014 (rrp: £7).

Kirsty Loftus, the producer’s UK manager, said: “Reserva is an important category for Rioja. It accounts for 22.4% of all Rioja imports to the UK, almost double that of Crianza (DOCa Rioja stats to November 2018) and is a proven stepping stone towards the more premium wines from the region. Our El Viaje de Ramon range combines our passion for innovation and meeting consumer needs – be it for pale pink rose or a mid-week drinking format – and is a key tool to recruit new consumers to explore everything Ramon Bilbao, and Rioja, has to offer.”

The 100% Tempranillo wine has been produced as an approachable style of Rioja Reserva with medium body and soft tannins, yet with flavours that are typical of an aged Tempranillo from this region.

Loftus said: “We are fortunate at Ramon Bilbao to won some quality vineyards at altitude in Rioja Alta and have older vines that are perfect for wines that need ageing. We want to make sure that the quality of the fruit is enhanced by time in barrel, not overwhelmed by it.”

Ramon Bilbao is currently the best-selling brand in the Spanish on-trade and is one of the fastest growing Rioja brands in the off-trade (+29%) in its competitive set, according to Nielsen data. The producer has been owned by the Zamora Company since 1999 and it is distributed by Enotria&Coe in the UK.

Different fomats continues to be a focal point for the Co-op. The retailer continues to add wines to its 37.5cl wine collection, and more recently it has added 50cl wines. Within these smaller formats it has also been focusing on adding more premium variants to encourage trial. Wine in cans and larger formats, such as bag-in-box, are also part of the Co-op's line up.

The wine bar and retailer concept, founded by James Dawson in 2009, has reached its £400,000 crowdfunding target via Seedrs.

The pitch on Seedrs said the company is launching a large flagship site in Canary Wharf in the second quarter of this year, and it plans to launch one to two each year after that.

It said: “Our four sites were all profitable within the first six months. We have four main revenue streams – wine bars and shops, online, wine club/ wine bank and wine school and events. We will use the funds to accelerate our growth. We consider the timing is perfect for us to create optimal growth in this sector of the industry.

""We will use the funds to open our fifth site. We plan to rapidly grow our new wine school and aim to improve our food offering. Funds will also allow us to hire a marketing and finance manager.”

Humble Grape started out as a wine importer and in 2014 it raised more than £500,000 to open its first high street venue.

It now imports more than 400 wines from 11 countries and it has wine shops and bars in Battersea, Fleet Street, Islington and Liverpool Street. The latter two sites were also funded via a successful crowdfunding campaign.

Sun and Steel, which is described as “one of the most complex beers Robinsons Brewery has ever produced”, is a 4.8% abv double fermented lager.

The idea for the beer, designed once again by Iron Maiden vocalist and beer fan Bruce Dickinson along with Robinsons’ head brewer Martyn Weeks, was first conceived in 2016 when Dickinson meet friend of the band George Yusa, owner of the 300 year-old, family-run Okunomatsu Saké Brewery in Fukushima. Dickinson became intrigued with the idea of putting the two flavour profiles together and thus Sun and Steel was born.

Weeks and his team has been carefully cultivating a strain of the yeast sent to them in 2017, once permission was obtained from the Japanese government to brew with it.

Dickinson said: “This has been such an exciting project. I had a crazy idea to try and make a saké -infused lager and over two and a half years later, here we are!

“I know Martyn and the team at Robinsons have had to become mad scientists to make this work but the end result is a really unique hybrid beer that tastes fantastic. Trooper fans have been asking for a lager, and here it is. I bet you would never have guessed we would do it like this though!”

Sun and Steel takes its name from the Iron Maiden song of the same name, which was in turn inspired by the life of Japanese Samurai Miyamoto Musashi. It is a hybrid beer because it is made with two yeasts. A lager yeast for the initial fermentation followed by a saké yeast for a second fermentation. The result is a delicate, subtle fruit flavour infused into a pilsner style lager, according to the brewer.

Sun and Steel, the sixth beer in the Trooper range, will be available in the UK – for the off and on-trades - from May 6th in celebration of Trooper’s sixth birthday. It will be released globally later in 2019.

Vineyards of the Surrey Hills will officially launch on an inaugural weekend of festivities from June 8-9 2019, to showcase the producers located in the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural beauty (AONB).

The group, which comprises: Denbies Wine Estate, High Clandon Vineyard, Albury Organic Vineyard, Chilworth Manor Vineyard and Greyfriars Vineyard; was created to celebrate the “excellence of wines grown in this unique area”. The area is formed of chalky limestone hills with the same geology of that of the Champagne region in France.

Nick Wenman, owned of Albury Organic Vineyard and chair of Wine GB South East, said: “We are proud to be putting Surrey on the map as a premium wine region, offering some of the very best wines and visitor experiences that England has to share.”

Sibylla Tindale, co-owner of High Clandon, said: “This initiative not only celebrates our outstanding wines but also the beauty of the five vineyards set within the Surrey Hills AONB. Each vineyard, from boutique to big, has unique offerings in multi-award winning English wines and tours. We want our visitors to delight in wandering through the vineyards, tasting the wines, to learn something new and to really immerse themselves here.”

Guests at the celebratory weekend can take part in a range of different activities at each vineyard. These include viewing sculptures, enjoying music or a picnic in historic gardens, exploring a “secret vineyard trail”, sampling a range of wines from tasting bars set in the vineyards, or even participating in a Battle of Waterloo “Champagne vs English sparkling taste-off” hosted by a Master of Wine.

The Huddersfield-based brewer was founded in 2011 by managing director, Richard Burhouse, and head brewer, Stuart Ross. The business employs 45 people and it currently exports its beers to 25 countries.

Burhouse, who will remain with the business, said the acquisition will drive a “shared promise to keep making great beer, on a bigger scale”.

Lion already has a role as the custodian for London craft brewer Fourpure Brewing Co, a position it has held since July 2018, while it also produces Castlemain’s flagship beer, XXXX.

Burhouse said: “With the support of our community in eight years Magic Rock has become one of the UK’s leading craft brewers, distributing across the UK as well as internationally. The best way for us to build on this legacy over the long term is to introduce Magic Rock beers to a much wider audience.

""We are excited to be joining one of the world’s best brewing experts under the shared promise to keep making great beer, on a bigger scale, through their knowledge, expertise and investment.”

Lion global markets managing director Matt Tapper said: “Magic Rock has been one of the pioneers in the UK craft beer scene and has built a loyal following due to its relentless pursuit of authenticity and quality.

Don Julio 70 was originally launched in the US to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the year Don Julio Gonzalez began making tequila. The tequila combines traditional Anejo flavours that result from 18 months of barrel aging with the fresh agave flavour associated with an unaged Blanco tequila.

The tequila is made using blue agave plants which are hand selected in Jalisco, Mexico. This is then distilled and aged for 18 months in reclaimed American White Oak barrels. Once the tequila reaches maturity it goes through a unique filtration process, resulting in a “stunning tequila”, which marries the best characteristics of both Don Julio Blanco and Don Julio Anejo, according to the company. The liquid is crystal clear, like Don Julio Blanco, while maintaining the notes of vanilla, wild honey and toasted oak, typical of an Anejo.

Rich Larkin, head of Diageo Reserve GB, said: “We’re delighted to introduce Don Julio 70 tequila to the UK. This first-of-its-kind tequila showcases the talent and skill of Master Distiller Enrique de Colsa who has created an Añejo Claro to challenge conventions and support the growth of super premium tequila in the UK. It’s a masterpiece of innovation.”

Don Julio 70 (rrp £70) is 35% abv and it will be available at the end of May at retailers including Master of Malt, The Whisky Exchange, Selfridges and Harvey Nichols.

Another contender has emerged in the on-going battle to land the most preposterous attack on the drinks industry in 2019.

Academics from the University of Southampton put out a press release this morning claiming that drinking one bottle of wine per week poses the same cancer risk as smoking five to 10 cigarettes.

The researchers have no idea what the cancer risk associated with smoking five to 10 cigarettes per week is. They also have no idea what the cancer risk associated with drinking a bottle of wine per week is.

The entire study is based on guesswork. “Alcohol and tobacco attributable fractions were subtracted from lifetime general population risks of developing alcohol- and smoking-related cancers, to estimate the lifetime cancer risk in alcohol-abstaining non-smokers,” said the authors. “This was multiplied by the relative risk of drinking ten units of alcohol or smoking ten cigarettes per week, and increasing levels of consumption.”

What that means is that they simply took a stab in the dark. They estimated that one bottle of wine a week increases a man’s lifetime risk of cancer by 1% per cent and a woman’s by 1.4%, because “breast cancer is particularly affected by alcohol”. They then estimated that this is equivalent to five cigarettes a week for men and 10 for women, although there no scientific facts underpinning these guesses.

Experts cannot quantify the risks of drinking moderate amounts of alcohol, and more evidence exists to suggest that it is actually beneficial to one’s health.

Nevertheless, this study generated a huge blitz of media coverage. Sky News, the BBC, The Times, The Telegraph, The Daily Star, The Scotsman, Yahoo News, The Sun, The Independent, the Daily Mail and the Evening Standard all published stories based on the press release, and anyone merely looking at the headlines might be alarmed.

“Risk of getting cancer from drinking just one bottle of wine is the same as smoking up to 10 CIGARETTES a week,” roared the Daily Mail, for example.

Sky News did provide one helpful quote from Jane Green, a professor of epidemiology at Oxford, who said: “It is important to view these results in context. For both men and women in the UK the lifetime risk of cancer is around 50%.

“The authors estimate that lifetime risk is aroud 1% higher for men and women who drink a bottle of wine a week, or who smoke five to 10 cigarettes a week, than for those who neither smoke nor drink.”

Cancer Research UK added that smoking causes many more types of cancer, while John Britton, director of the UK centre for tobacco and alcohol studies at the University of Nottingham, said smoking is substantially more hazardous than alcohol consumption.

Chris Snowdon of the Institute of Economic Affairs, delivered a typically scathing rebuttal to this latest salvo in the “campaign to turn alcohol into the new tobacco”.

He said: “Its authors say that their intention is to provide ‘a useful measure for communicating possible cancer risks that exploits successful historical messaging on smoking’. They insist that they are ‘not saying that drinking alcohol in moderation is in any way equivalent to smoking’.

“Yeah, right. The only reason this study was conducted was to generate headlines to the effect of ‘drinking is as bad as smoking’ – and it has worked. The ‘study’ might boost the impact factor of the journal that published it, but it has no academic merit. There is no reason for it to exist other than as propaganda.”

He then concluded that “being teetotal does the same damage to your heart as smoking five cigarettes a week” to expose the ludicrous nature of the study’s assumptions.

Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, dismissed the study as “absurd”. “It is irresponsible and confusing to try to equate the risks of smoking and drinking alcohol,” she said. “The impact on health from smoking is clear. This study risks undermining important messages about the dangers of smoking.”

The Alcohol Information Partnership added: “The conclusions drawn from this study are both unhelpful and confusing at a time when the public is being bombarded with contradictory warnings of risk.

“There are a wide variety of genetic and lifestyle factors that can contribute to an increased risk of cancer and the study itself is clear that drinking in moderation is not equivalent to smoking.”

Yet perhaps the most sinister reaction came from Bob Patton, of the University of Surrey, who said: “It is likely that the findings from this study will have a profound effect on the way drinkers, and in particular female drinkers, regard the risks associated with alcohol consumption.

“Viewing alcohol drinking in the same light as cigarette smoking may well result in a decrease in consumption and its related harms.”

It may not be true, but the study may well result in a decrease in alcohol consumption anyway, simply due to the barrage of headlines plastered all over the press today.

The variant is the biggest new product launch from Martini and the company has invested £2 million for its first year alone.

Martini Fiero taps into the trend for brightly-coloured drinks, while also boasting 100% natural flavour and colour through a blend of white wines and botanicals, including Murcia orange peel, Artemisia absinthium and Artemisia pontica.

The drink’s bitter-sweet orange flavour has been crafted to pair specifically with tonic water.

Ivano Tonutti, Martini’s master herbalist, said: “Creating Martini Fiero was an exercise in balance. From a botanical point of view, it was essential to harmonise the vibrant citrus notes of the Murcia orange peel with the bitterness and herbal aromatics of the Artemisia alongside the many other botanicals, which in turn had to sit happily alongside the quinine in tonic.”

Beppe Musso, Martini master blender, added: “We also worked hard to ensure the intense flavours of our white wine and citrus core would come through when the tonic is added. We are proud of the result – a modern vermouth with a distinctive bittersweet orange flavour that comes to life when paired with tonic. Martini Fiero is the ideal drink for the modern aperitivo.”

Martini Fiero (rsp: £12) is available at Asda and Ocado and it will be rolled out across Sainsbury’s, The Co-op, Morrisons and Amazon next month.

Pernod Ricard has invested in its Lamb’s Navy Rum brand with a relaunch of Lamb’s Spiced Rum to increase awareness among younger consumers.

Also this month is the launch of Spice Hunter, a new spiced rum from Berry Bros & Rudd, while Bacardi Spiced is set to hit shelves in April.

Other brands are also appearing in the UK. Earlier this month Glasgow Distillery announced it was also extended into this space with Banditti Club – Glasgow Spiced Rum, while Hammonds of Knutsford is introducing Diablesse Caribbean Rum, including a spiced variant: Diablesse Clementine Spiced Rum. Also this month Halewood Wines & Spirits has introduced a new bottle design for all of its Dead Man’s Fingers rum variants, and it said its Spiced and Coffee flavours have now secured listings in Sainsbury’s.

The rum category has the second youngest adult shopper profile in the off-trade and spiced rum is driving overall category performance, according to Nielsen data (year to September 8, 2018). The data also indicates spiced rum as an opportunity to recruit younger adult shoppers into the category, as existing brands largely appeal to an older, more masculine consumer at present.

The revamp of Lamb’s Spiced aims to target both men and women aged 18-28 years old, and Pernod hopes to reinvent it as “a bold and playful brand” for those wanting to try a new spiced rum.

Toni Ingram, head of marketing for Lamb’s Navy Rum, said: “The new look for Lamb’s Spiced is a clear break from the existing branding with edgy and rebellious aspects, which will appeal to a younger adult audience who we know are seeking experiences and are open to taking risks.

""We are not shying away from the fact the new label aims to recruit more females into a rapidly growing segment for the rum category. Consumer feedback to date has been highly positive and the new bottle has a clear place at the centre of social occasions.”

Meanwhile, Berry Bros’ Spice Hunter is launching via its UK distributor Fields, Morris & Verdin, with initial listings in 19 bars of Revolucion De Cuba.

The spice blend features 13 spices, which the producer claims is “more than any other rum”, including clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, pepper and ginger. These are then blended with an aged Mauritian rum.

Jack Denley, brand executive for Spice Hunter, said: “We’re hugely excited to bring Spice Hunter to the UK market. This is a rum that doesn’t get lost in the mix and challenges you to make a bold move. With its 13 exotic spices and aged Mauritian rum, Spice Hunter is designed for the modern drinker; complex, approachable and undeniably bold.”

Brewgooder is joining forces with Co-op for its first national retail campaign.

The Co-op Well Dig will see the ethical craft beer brand celebrate its third birthday by linking up with the retailer.

The campaign launches today (May 20) and it runs until May 14 across 408 Co-op stores nationwide. It aims to sell enough brewgooder four-packs through participating stores to exclusively fund clean water access for two rural communities in Malawi.

The two Malawi-based communities – the Matipa and Waluma Villages – will both receive borehole installations providing consistent, first-time clean water access to more than 1,000 villagers.

Alan Mahon, founder of Brewgooder, said: “This campaign is the first of its kind in retail and we are massively excited to partner with Co-op on it.

“As businesses, we both share the same values and desire to empower people by what we do. But now we are putting the power in the hands of Co-op shoppers to directly transform the lives of 1,000 people through the power of beer, and I can’t wait to see the results.”

Over the course of the campaign, Brewgooder will be documenting the stories of some of the villagers that will be positively affected by the campaign so that Co-op employees, customers and members can witness ‘real life’ in Malawi and develop a greater understanding of the life-changing impact they will be bringing about.

Joseph Walker, Co-op beer buyer, said: “We have raised millions of pounds to provide clean water and sanitation in some of the world’s poorest communities. Co-op is committed to alleviating water poverty and we’re proud to be partnering with Brewgooder on this latest campaign, which will transform the lives of so many people.”

Brewgooder donates 100% of its profits to fund clean water and sanitation projects in developing countries. To date, it has helped more than 60,000 people across Malawi through 87 clean water projects that have supplied 100,000 gallons of safe water.

Each case of Brewgooder sold will provide a person with clean water for more than five year, according to the producer.

Äppelblom (apple blossom), which is described as “a whisky reminiscent of spring and fresh green apples in both taste and design”, has been created by finishing the process in saturated oak casks which previously held Calvados.

Mackmyra’s master blender Angela D’Orazio worked together with Calvados producer Christian Drouin and his son Guillaume, to create ehe single malt whisky with “a lovely twist of apple”.

D’Orazio said: “The choice of calvados producer was easy. Christian Drouin creates absolutely fantastic calvados in all respects, with genuine craftsmanship in every product since 1965, he has challenged French traditions in this area, and is therefore the perfect match for Mackmyra’s approach and our enjoyment of experimenting. The light apple tones from our whisky, in combination with the more mature apple flavours from the calvados, give Äppelblom a generous cask character with a fine spicy balance,”

Guillaume Drouin, managing director at Calvados Christian Drouin, said: “Calvados is a delicate and fruity spirit. When discovering Äppelblom, I was very impressed by the delicate marriage between the pear and citrus notes of the whisky with the apple and oxidative flavours given by our casks.

""The result is a very expressive and elegant whisky which will be just perfect at spring time. Since we have a very long aging for our calvados we hardly get the opportunity to use them for a second fill, therefore I was happy to see the result of this innovative aging using one of the very few casks we ship from our cellar.”

Mackmyra Äppelblom is priced £60 for a 70cl bottle and it has been launched into the UK market this month.

The wine is a blend of Chardonnary, Glera and Nebbiolo grapes from premium northern Italy.

Marco Mazzini, global director for Martini at brand owner Bacardi, said: “Dry styles of rosé have been increasing in popularity over the last year in the UK, and with summer 2019 approaching it doesn’t look like it’s due to slow down. We thought it was the perfect time to launch Martini rosé extra dry in the UK, as British consumers have the palette for drier styles.

“It is a modern, refreshing style that can be enjoyed across a variety of occasions and with a wide range of foods. We are excited to launch it in the UK, and hope that it is enjoyed across a wide generation of adults.”

TV star Graham Norton is also urging shoppers to snap up his new pink gin, made by West Cork Distillers.

“Why bore the woman you love the most with chocolates, when you can wow her with a bottle of my own Pink Gin?” said Norton.

It said this is the “only responsible course of action” due to “continued uncertainty over whether the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal”.

It ships beers, wines and spirits for all the UK supermarkets, plus a number of wholesalers, independent retailers, convenience chains and pub and restaurant groups.

It sent out a customer advisory note today notifying the trade that it has decided to hold fire on planning any further imports.

“If there is an extension to the Brexit deadline then we estimate that the backlog of orders will begin to clear by April 9,” it said.

Firms have already been advised that it would not be prudent to start any shipments that would not conclude before 11pm on March 29.

That remains the current date for Brexit, but Theresa May has twice failed to push her divorce deal through parliament and it has also voted against crashing out of the bloc without a deal. Plans are now afoot to request a delay, but uncertainty reigns and the extreme unpredictability has forced JF Hillebrand into drastic action.

The region suffered a 14% downturn in volume exports globally, predominantly due to the low 2017 harvest and magnified by a slowdown in wine imports by China, the biggest market for Bordeaux wines.

But despite this global downturn, volume exports to the UK from Bordeaux remained steady.

Allan Sichel, Bordeaux Wine Council (CIVB) president, told DRN: “We are pleased with the performance in the UK.

“Where the UK does stand out is that it is maintaining its levels in volume terms while a lot of other countries have dropped in volume, even if they have maintained or grown in value.”

Value growth in the UK market has been attributed to the strong reputation of the most recent Bordeaux vintages.

In addition, the UK remained the top destination for Bordeaux white wines in 2018, while sales of rosé and sparkling wine from the region also grew.

Sichel said: “We are especially pleased with the performance of white wines because the UK is the first export destination for Bordeaux white wines.

“Rosé is also growing. It is a very popular segment the world over but Bordeaux is producing more and more rosé wines. But the other thing to note is that those growers making rosé no longer – as they used to in the past – have it as a byproduct while they focus on the reds. Now they are dedicated to making rosé wines right from the start of the harvesting, and they are now making some very good rosé wines. “

Fiona Juby, CIVB’s UK marketing consultant, added: “For us it is a good introduction for some of the younger and some female consumers into the world of Bordeaux. The white, rosé and Crémant wines can help bring people into the category and then it helps them to explore the area further.”

He said: “Production has multiplied by three in the past five years, just in Bordeaux. A third of the Crémant produced is rosé Crémant.”

Juby said sparkling rosé wines make sense for the UK market due to the popularity of each of these categories. It could also give the region an advantage over Prosecco.

She said: “Prosecco has done a great job in growing that sparkling category and moving it away from being just for special occasions and celebrations to being an aperitif and everyday drink and that definitely gives us an opportunity. Crémant is definitely growing for us and it’s an interesting area.”

For 2019 the CIVB has plans to run its Bordeaux Wine Month campaign in September and it will be working with independent retailers to help with promotions in store, supported by merchandising packs. The campaign was successfully run for the first time in 2018.

Juby said: “It was very successful last year. We had one retailer who sold 200% more than he normally would. We will definitely do it again this year, and we are planning to ensure each promotion by retailers will include at least one white wine from Bordeaux as white is a big part of our focus this year.”

The CIVB is also focusing heavily on sustainability with 60% of the region’s vineyards now under some kind of sustainable certification.

Sichel said: “Our objective is that by 2025 we want every single grower to be involved in an environmental certification of some kind.”

Think Gin will take place at the Honourable Artillery Company in London on June 18 and this year’s event will be the biggest yet.

We launched Think Gin in 2015 as the gin revolution was in its infancy and the event has mushroomed in line with the soaring fortunes of the category since then.

UK gin sales grew volume sales by 41% in 2018 (Nielsen and CGA) and the upward trend has continued in 2019.

The fifth annual Think Gin event will once again help retailers and on-trade buyers put together dynamic gin ranges. The day features debates, masterclasses and tasting sessions, while you can taste a huge range of gins from producers of all shapes and sizes.

Each year we have had to move to a bigger venue as the number of visitors and exhibitors continues to spiral, and we will take over the HAC near Old Street Station on June 18.

This year we are also excited to launch Think Tequila and Mezcal, which will take place in an adjacent hall, allowing guests to step out of the botanic-themed area into a vibrant slice of Mexicana.

Tequila is a much smaller category than gin in the UK, but we recognise its vast potential. It ticks all the boxes around craft and authenticity that consumers are looking for, and its versatility as a sipping drink and a cocktail mixer makes it perfectly poised to grow sales in a market driven by premium spirits.

We will run further masterclasses and educational sessions to improve the trade’s knowledge of tequila. You can also decide for yourself if a tequila and tonic really is better than a gin and tonic, as some are now claiming.

Buyers can now tick off two exciting categories by visiting the HAC on June 18 and we look forward to seeing you there.

That represents a 46% increase over the past 52 weeks and investor Ian Cowie believes there is still plenty more scope for the brewer and pub operators to outperform the market.

The Sunday Times’ personal account columnist bought shares in the business when they were 490p last year.

Britain then basked in glorious summer weather and England enjoyed an unexpected run to the World Cup semi-finals, boosting the sector and helping Greene King enjoy a strong trading period.

Cowie reported his delight at his decision to ignore his doubts and back the brewer at a time when pessimism abounded.

“Pessimism about this £1.5 billion business looked overdone,” he said. “I bought its shares at 490p – 20% less than they had cost a decade earlier and priced at 6.9 times corporate earnings, locking in a yield of 6.8% on which there is no further tax to pay.

“Greene King closed at 674p on Friday – or 37% more than I paid a year ago – and I believe there is further to go. Buyers today can still obtain a market-beating yield of 4.9% and the price/earnings ratio of 10.7 remains undemanding.

“Everyone knows how expensive beer has become and that drink-drive laws have forced many pubs to close. Few folk, though, seem to have noticed how resilient businesses have always innovated to survive in the past – and Greene King will celebrate its 220th anniversary this year.

“Even fewer investors seem to have considered that most millennials have no mortgage to pay these days and so have spare cash to spend – or, further out, how driverless cars might bring country pubs within reach once again.”

The firm will appoint Nick Mackenzie as its new chief executive when incumbent Rooney Anand stands down on May 1. Mackenzie joins from Merlin Entertainments, where he is responsible for the Midway portfolio of attractions, including 100 businesses around the world such as Madame Tussauds, the London Eye and SeaLife centres. He has also worked with Bass and Allied Domecq as acquisitions director.

It also named 28-year-old Ross O’Hara as its new head brewer, the 17th in its 220-year history.

In the past year it has taken on distribution of Estrella Galicia and launched a 0.5% version of its bestselling brew, Old Speckled Hen.

The price stood at 270.5p when trading closed on Friday and it decreased 11.1% to 241.5p by 10am on Monday.

The company will now rebrand as Naked Wines plc to reflect a growing focus on online sales going forward.

It purchased Naked Wines in a £70 million deal back in 2015 and installed the online retailer’s founder, Rowan Gormley, as chief executive, replacing Steve Lewis.

It followed a poor year for Majestic’s retail estate and Gormley was parachuted in to turn the business around.

Since then, online sales have continued to grow due to Naked Wines’ strong performance in the UK and the US, while retail sales at the Majestic estate have been less dynamic.

In a statement to the City, Majestic said almost 45% of its business now comes from online sales, with a further 20% from international sales.

It is now planning to close Majestic stores – it will reveal precisely how many in June – and ramp up its focus on Naked Wines.

There will be job losses, and this again will be revealed in June, when it presents its full year results.

It follows news of Oddbins being plunged into administration and provides further evidence that the role of the multiple specialist brick and mortar drinks retailer could well be dying out.

Gormley said: ""It is clear that Naked Wines has the potential for strong sustainable growth, and we will deliver the best results for our shareholders, customers, people and suppliers by focusing all our energies on delivering that potential.

“We also believe that a transformed Majestic business does have the potential to be a long-term winner, but that we risk not maximising the potential of Naked if we try to do both.

“Where we have no choice but to close stores we will aim to minimise job losses by migration into Naked.”

He added that was on target to hit sales of £500m this year, and profits were also on track. Naked Wines sales have doubled since 2015 and they are expected to hit £175 million this year, while Majestic Wine also has a strong ecommerce offering.

As part of its plans, Majestic will increase customer investment in Naked by £6m per year, bringing the annual figure to about £26m.

Capital will be released from its Majestic Retail and Commercial operations through “a combination of customer migration to the Naked brand, asset sales and store closures”.

The statement from Gormley and the group lacks fine detail about the magnitude and timeframe of the restructuring.

Analysts at Liberum Capital called it a “drastic and unexpected change in strategy” as it cut its forecasts from full year 2020 onwards.

It added: “We know investment in Naked is to rise by £6 million in full year 2020 and then by more thereafter. If this investment can consistently be invested at a sustainable return on investment, then this is a good thing but we wait to know if the new digital channels the group is targeting are generating the same, or better, returns than vouchers and other routes that have been primarily used historically.

“The sale of Majestic, or site closures is a complete change and this could have material impacts to the balance sheet, and dividends – quite a change in tone and strategy since the capital market day last year. We now assume no final dividend for full year 2019 due to timing of the transformation programme but one should view the outer years at risk.”

The Bacchus/Pinot Blanc wine comes from Lyme Bay Winery and it will sell for £9.99 a bottle.

Going into a major multiple – let alone a discounter – is a risk for any English winery, but Lyme Bay managing director James Lambert told DRN he was swayed by the retailer’s commitment to uphold its premium price point.

Aldi wine buyer Mike James, who is celebrating a decade in the role this year, said: “It’s what I wanted from an English wine: acidic, racy, brilliant with fish and chips.

“We started the conversations pre-harvest, talked about volumes and costs and agreed that we are not here to be a big, bad, bullying multiple.

“We put it under our Exquisite Collection at £9.99. At any retailer, and certainly Aldi, it is a juicy price point, but it’s a serious wine. Hopefully the customers will really like what we are doing.”

James reported that Aldi continues to outperform the market in wine and he is celebrating a first-ever Retailer of the Year win at the International Wine Challenge.

“We can talk the talk and walk the walk and the proof is on the shelves. It’s in the market data and our performance,” he said. “We are really proud of what we have been doing. Our shelves aren’t just full of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc and Italian Pinot Grigio.

“We have to tick those boxes, but we are still nimble and innovative and bringing things to the market.

“We are very pleased with our growth. We had a great summer and it was better than the good summer our competitors were seeing.”

James said the retailer saw massive sales of rosé and crisp, acidic wines such as Muscadet, Riesling, Albariño and Picpoul last summer. “We have all those again, and we are trying to be a bit more creative around that, with a couple of white wines from Portugal and some white blends from southern France.”

He added: “We sold an incredible amount of Portuguese wine in 2018 – an unsurprising trend given the great value and easy-drinking style of so many of the wines produced there. While the Douro had a difficult vintage, we still see Portugal as a great opportunity and, during our trip there in November, we uncovered some brilliant new wines, such as the Wine Foundry Avesso, which will boost our Portuguese offering further.

“We have a lot of rosé. We have backed the summer horse and, to be honest, even if it’s just an average British summer this year, people want to feel the summer vibe.”

Buying was a challenge last year due to a short harvest, particularly in Europe, but that pressure has eased now. “Buying in Europe has been a bit easier,” said James. “The 2017 vintage was a challenge and a lot of creativity was needed in terms of blending to stretch volumes to get the quality. It has been generally easier this year.”

Brexit looms large on the horizon, but he added: “We have the same challenges everybody else does. We are confident we will have wine on the shelves and our customers will be happy. We are not going to let anything get in the way of that.”

A total of 430 senior members and UK drinks industry personalities attended the Charity’s annual major fundraiser.

The evening started in the iconic Fossil Way with a Champagne reception in the Salon des Champagnes, sponsored by Laurent-Perrier, Louis Roederer, Moet et Chandon and Taittinger Champagne.

The next stage of the evening took place in the Hintze Hall, where guests were welcomed by a surprise beneficiary of The Benevolent, Joe Fattorini, who bravely shared his story, explaining to guests as to how The Benevolent’s mental health Helpline has assisted him, and how he has benefitted from the counseling sessions, all funded by the charity.

Chairman Michael Saunders reiterated his appeal to “spare a drink a month for The Benevolent” with the idea of donating the equivalent of a drink a month to the charity if possible.

A highlight of the evening was the entertainment provided by the Master of Ceremonies, Charles Metcalfe.

The Benevolent’s Chief Executive Chris Porter commented: “I am thrilled that our vision to host the Benevolent Ball in a bigger venue to accommodate the greater demand that we knew was there has resulted in such a great evening. I cannot thank all our sponsors and friends in the industry enough who have helped us to achieve this.

""I am delighted with the amount that we have raised. Please know that every penny will go towards helping those in our drinks industry community who are suffering financial and emotional hardship at this time. A brilliant night where the Trade really has come together to help its own.”

The Benevolent also extended its “special thanks” to the main sponsors of the evening: Diageo GB, IWSC Group, JF Hillebrand, Matthew Clark, Mayfield Sussex Hop Gin, Pernod Ricard UK, William Grant & Sons.

Gin has overtaken whisky as the largest category by volume at online retailer Master of Malt after enjoying huge sales growth over the past...,"18 March, 2019",http://cdn744.pressflex.net/images//18570.photo.2.jpg?m=1552900316,http://drinksretailingnews.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/18570/Master_of_Malt_reports_30_25_sales_growth_as_gin_soars.html,"Gin has overtaken whisky as the largest category by volume at online retailer Master of Malt after enjoying huge sales growth over the past year. “It continues to grow and it occupies a large part of my day,” says head buyer Guy Hodcroft. “We’ve been watching it over the past few years catching up, and now it has overtaken, which is really exciting.

“We talk about a gin bubble, but there’s a lot of mileage in it yet. I live in a very alcohol-centric world – most of my friends are in the trade, my other half is –– so we talk about drinking gin all the time, but for many people it’s still new. Up and down the country there’s a lot of time still to go.”

A love of wine propelled Hodcroft into the drinks industry and he worked as a sommelier in Spain during his formative years in the trade. He set up and managed a Corks Out store in the north west of England for Ruth Yates and worked for Harvey Nichols in the region before joining Selfridges. Its head buyer, Dawn Davies MW, became not only his colleague, but also his landlord as he rented a room from her.

“She’s fantastic, a force of nature, and I mean that in a very positive sense,” he says. “I was there for three-and-a-bit years with her, and then she left to go to The Whisky Exchange, and I hung around for a year and then the job at Master of Malt came up and it seemed like a good time to move.”

Hodcroft’s background is in wine, but now spirits – and gin in particular – dominate his days in the trade. “When I was at Selfridges, Dawn and I did everything together – beer, wine, spirits as a team,” he says. “I have very fond memories of doing something like 72 beers before 8am and thinking, oh yeah, these are nice.

“Her successor as the head buyer at Selfridges was Terry Threlfall, who is still there now. He was sommelier at Chez Bruce for a number of years. His background is very much wine – an interest in spirits, but not vast. I said it makes sense for me to do the spirits side, and you to do the wine. It’s allowed me to enjoy wine again, and now obsess – these tannins aren’t very well managed are they, I think they’ve acidified, have they acidified? I can just not entirely geek-out about it and say, yes, that’s a nice glass.”

Having said that, he is now building up a wine range at Master of Malt. “It’s growing, from a very small base,” he says. “I’m trying to build a range. Nothing too esoteric, just classics done well at varying price points. Three Chablis – one entry-level, one mid-range, one high-end – Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Rioja, Chianti, nothing too weird and wonderful.”

Master of Malt is now owned by AB-Inbev, the world’s largest brewer, which also controls online beer retailer Beer Hawk. Hodcroft and his team also have a beer range, but you will not find the likes of Stella Artois, Budweiser and Beck’s in it.

“Beer is doing really well,” he says. “It tends to be craft. We do very well with UK-based breweries, and quite a lot of American and speciality Belgian, German and Italian breweries. Beer is in a nice place. The only snag is that I’m used to working with things without a shelf life, and I have to go, oh yeah, beer does expire eventually. But nothing has gone wrong yet.”

The team at Beer Hawk say that AB-Inbev largely leaves them to their own devices, and Hodcroft’s take on the situation is similar. The brewer can benefit from Master of Malt’s shopper insights and it provides significant commercial backing, but he says that it does not heavily involve itself in operations.

Business is currently booming for Master of Malt, which was set up as a mail-order vehicle for Scotch whisky in the mid-1980s. The company has undergone several makeovers and Scotch is still a chief focus – it remains the largest category by value – but gin is now leading the charge in volume. Hodcroft reports that overall sales are up 30% at Master of Malt in the past year, with retail sales growing at 26% and sales to trade up 41%.

“There’s still a lot of space to move,” he says. “Just 2.5% of people buy their alcohol online, so there are clearly a lot more people we can try to reach. We are going great guns and there are some ambitious targets for this year. They are similar numbers.”

The firm engages in friendly competition with The Whisky Exchange, while both retailers are under pressure from the rise of Amazon. “Eighteen months ago it was selling more SKUs you find in multiple grocers, but it is moving more into the specialist sphere,” says Hodcroft when asked about the world’s largest ecommerce retailer. “It just means that we have to work a little bit harder and get what we do right – the virtual reality tours, the customer service, the Whisky Santa and all that kind of thing. If we do all of those things well, hopefully we can keep ourselves in front.”

Master of Malt is investing in content, hiring former editorial staff from The Spirits Business, including former editor Kristiane Sherry, plus author Henry Jeffreys, in order to establish credibility online.

“We have expanded the editorial content team over the past year and we have three people now doing distillery profiles and that sort of thing,” says Hodcroft. “I think we do well, the team knows its stuff and the tone is very important to us. We get a lot of suppliers who want us to use their tasting notes and imagery, but we say no, no, it needs to sound like we’ve written this. Some of the notes are a little bit off the wall, and we could probably update some of the older ones – one of the strong points of the site is that it is authoritative, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously. We realise we are selling alcohol to people. It’s not life and death, and it should be enjoyed.”

Hodcroft notes that mead sales are up 64%, suggesting it could be down to the popularity of Game of Thrones. Tequila and mezcal, vermouth, spiced rum and liqueurs are also highlighted as categories that are currently soaring.

“Our commitment is that we try to have pretty much anything,” he says. “If you’ve had a Lithuanian liqueur on holiday, we’ll probably have a bottle somewhere. Whisky will always be a focus, but we don’t pursue it to the detriment of other categories.”

On the wholesale side, he adds: “We are different to most other supply businesses. We don’t have anyone doing field sales. What stands out is the breadth of our range and the service. If you order by 6pm as a trade customer, you’ll probably get it by 9am the next morning. We will sell you one bottle or 50.”

Mezcal is a category that particularly excites Hodcroft right now. “Now you have got two major brand owners with mezcal in their portfolios – Diageo and Pernod Ricard – and it will be interesting to see what happens there,” he says. “Mezcal reminds me of wine and I love that about it. Different agave species give you different flavours, depending on where they are grown. There are hundreds and hundreds of varieties.

“Low and no alcohol, there’s a lot of space there. Seedlip has done incredibly well. Dawn and I launched Seedlip at Selfridges. We were the first retailer to sell it. It’s done very well. Ceder’s is nice stuff. People seem to be wanting it.

“Most of our sales go to bars, rather than a consumer buying them. There’s still space there for someone to go after that at-home consumer.”

Hodcroft says he feels privileged to work in the drinks trade and he is planning on a long career in the industry. “Very few people leave it,” he says. “I think once you are in it, you don’t suddenly say, I want to sell chairs for a living. I am very lucky that it’s my hobby, but it’s also my passion and I get to do it 12 hours a day.”

Independent retailer Real Ale has chosen Notting Hill as the venue for its third store as it continues to expand across the capital.

Founder Nick Dolan opened the first outlet in Twickenham back in 2005 and it mainly sold 50cl bottles of ale from across the UK.

A couple of years later the craft beer revolution began to gather pace and the business’ fortunes have soared in line with that.

Bottle shops became commonplace across London and it overhauled its iconic Twickenham store, a serial winner at our Drinks Retailing Awards. The team transformed it from a store resembling a farm shop to a modern space full of fridges, taps and growlers.

Retailers like We Brought Beer began to expand their estates and Real Ale could not afford to stand still so it opened a second outlet in Maida Vale in 2017.

That store came with a greater on-trade element, featuring eight taps, space to drink on site and a downstairs area for tutored tastings.

The new shop on Notting Hill’s Golborne Road continues that theme, as it is billed as a “shop and taproom” featuring natural wine, cider and spirits from small producers alongside its core beer offering.

It will offer a rotating selection of beers and wines available on tap, with an Enomatic wine dispenser for sampling high-end wines. Everything from the retail range will be available to drink in. It will also be the largest store in the estate.

Retail manager Tim Peyton said: “Our aim is to create a comfortable and inviting space for people to discover delicious drinks from small producers all over the world.”

To celebrate the launch of the new store, Real Ale will team with two of its favourite producers for the first time to create a new collaboration brew.

Throughout the year it plans to run a series of events, hosting brewers, cidermakers, winemakers, distillers and BWS suppliers, who will offer tastings and discussions. The taproom will host a number of tap takeovers with independent breweries from all over the country, showcasing one-off and seasonal releases.

Markowski moves up from her role as account controller for convenience and in her new role she will be responsible for growing ABInbev’s presence in the convenience channel.

She joined the company in 2008 and during her time at the company she has worked in several roles both in the UK and in Europe.

Martin Yntema, off trade sales director for AB InBev UK & Ireland, said: “I’m delighted to announce Jess’ appointment. This newly created role of Sales Director - Convenience and Wholesale reflects the increasing importance of the convenience channel to our overall off-trade growth strategy. Jess has done a fantastic job developing the off-trade business so I’m sure she will continue to be a success in her new role.”

Markowski said: “I’m excited to progress into this new role, helping to increase the presence of our brands in retail and wholesale outlets across the UK. The shopper’s behaviour is changing: consumers now shop more regularly, and the location, accessibility and breadth of choice available in convenience stores cater to these needs.

""I’m looking forward to working with the team on maintaining momentum across our business and accelerating the success of our global brands, Stella Artois, Budweiser and Corona and newer arrivals like Bud Light and Michelob ULTRA.”

Banditti Club – Glasgow Spiced Rum, which is matured and spiced in Glasgow, is made using rum distilled from freshly pressed sugar cane juice on the Island of Madeira. It is aged for up to 12 months in oak casks, and then it is spiced with a selection of fresh tropical fruit and exotic spices, including pineapple, orange, cacoa and allspice.

The rum is described as having notes of clove and anise that lead to a long spicy finish.

Mark Hayward, co-founder, said: “The city of Glasgow has a strong historical connection with rum and therefore it felt right that we bring our own brand to market.

“We believe now is a perfect time to join the growing number of rums in the market, as consumers seek to further explore and discover new drinking experiences.

“Banditti Club offers a premium, all-natural product with no added sugars or colourings which we believe stands alongside the best spiced rums currently available.”

Glasgow Distillery Company have named this newcomer Banditti Club as a historic reference to a group of Glaswegians who enjoyed getting together, listening to music and drinking rum punch.

The team at Vivir is bidding to turn tequila into a mainstream spirits category in the UK by spreading the gospel about its craft, provenance and versatility.

Tequila is worth just £20 million in the off-trade (Nielsen) as it is dwarfed by the likes of gin and vodka, but that could change as Vivir continues to gain listings.

Co-founder Paul Hayes made his name as the first man to bring Bircher muesli to the UK. He only used natural ingredients and agave syrup was the sole sweetener he would add.

That led to him building up strong contacts in the agave industry and he saw an opportunity for a 100% Weber blue agave tequila to take the UK market by storm.

He cannot put his finger on what it is, but he knows he is allergic to something in the mixto tequilas that dominate the UK market.

He set out to produce a range of premium tequilas specifically for Britain, teaming up with the most awarded distillery in Jalisco to source the liquid.

The result is a blanco, reposado and anejo, retailing at £36, £39 and £44 respectively, all under the Vivir brand, which means life in Spanish.

The reposado is aged for six months in Jack Daniels casks and the anejo stays in cask for 18 months to take on oaky notes of vanilla and banana.

It started trying to get listings a couple of years ago and that there were obstacles to be overcome. Many Brits think of tequila as a shot they have drunk on wild nights out, requiring a slice of lemon immediately shoved into their mouths to prevent them from throwing up.

Yet the boom in gin sales and interest in its provenance has helped spark curiosity in tequila, and the Vivir team has won a number of listings already.

It first went into high-end on-trade accounts like Nobu and the Mayfair Hotel. It was then distributed through Speciality Drinks and Amathus and it has just picked up listings with Master of Malt and Fortnum & Mason, while it is in the final stages of negotiations with Harrods and Selfridges.

In September, the anejo will go into 200 Waitrose stores and this will be the first time an anejo tequila has ever made it onto a multiple retailer shelf.

Hayes believes that its specific focus on tequila and its position as the only independent UK tequila brand has helped it gain listings with relative ease.

He told DRN: “Big distributors like Diageo and Pernod Ricard have tequilas, but the reps want to push the high-volume vodka and tequila brands [to the trade]. We only deal with tequila, so people in bars and stores like us visiting. We go in and do tastings and masterclasses. They have been getting this with gin for five years and with whisky and rum now, but they say we are the first ones doing it with tequila. The boom for gin has helped us. We just hit the market at the right time.”

Keith Webb, a drinks industry veteran and consultant to the business, said: “The trade, both on and off, has been unbelievably excited by the combination of a fantastic product, provenance and packaging. In fact I’ve never seen such a reaction, and I’ve been around the drinks trade for quite a while.”

Hayes said that consumers are now willing to sip tequila. “Most people don’t have a clue about tequila, so there’s a level of curiosity,” he said. “It’s great for cocktails like Espresso Martinis and Manhattans. An Old Fashioned works really well.

“Tequila and tonic is great, particularly citrus-based tonics with grapefruit or orange. Tequila has more botanicals. We have converted a lot of people to tequila and tonic.

“Tequila is renowned for being the healthiest spirit. When you distil agave from sugars it’s one of the few things that keeps a high level of fiber, so your insulin doesn’t spike. When you get drunk off tequila it’s different to other spirits. People party more and they are more active.”",Vivir aims to take tequila into the mainstream

It also supplies Stella Artois, Corona, Beck’s, Bass, Camden Town, Michelob Ultra, Boddingtons and more, but it decided that Budweiser is the king of its beers.

Paula Lindenberg, who took over as president in January following a stint at the group’s Ambev business in Brazil, said: “We are a fast-paced, ambitious group that dreams big, and we have exciting plans ahead for the UK and Ireland.

“Through the power and recognition of the Budweiser brand, we want to open ourselves up to working with more partners to achieve our ambitions.

“We are looking forward to making a big impact in the year ahead, working towards brewing our beers with 100% renewable electricity and accelerating our progress towards 20% of our global products being no or low alcohol.”

Budweiser will soon be brewed using 100% British barley and 100% renewable electricity from UK solar power, according to the supplier, “giving the classic American brand a special stake in the UK”.

AB InBev is the world’s largest drinks supplier and Budweiser Brewing Group UK&I is the leading supplier to the UK trade. It also owns online retailers Master of Malt and Beer Hawk, plus spirits arm Maverick Drinks, while it has a stake in distributor Matthew Clark after helping C&C rescue it from the ashes of the Conviviality empire last year.

It is poised to open a new London headquarters on Fetter Lane in Farringdon, covers 25,000 sq ft over the top four floors of the new Bureau building and a rooftop bar.

It brings together three previously separate offices and 250 employees, while it will continue to operate breweries in Samlesbury, Magor and Enfield, where Camden Town beers are now brewed.

The new group outlined five ambitions for the UK:
• Champion Britain’s iconic beer culture with trade-boosting programmes for the whole community, from barley farmers to pubs and retail
• Create a nation of Smart Drinkers, helping to shift social norms to embrace moderation and cut harmful drinking
• Be the UK’s most sustainable brewer as it works towards brewing with renewable electricity and locally-sourced barley
• Be one of the best places to work, promoting apprenticeships, development and diversity
• Bring more people together with great beers for every occasion by continuing to invest in premium drinks and powerful brands

Majestic Wine’s managing director Joshua Lincoln has written to all customers in a bid ""explain the big picture"" beyond today's headlines.

""Firstly it is important to tell you what isn’t changing,"" he said. ""We will still be a face to face wine retailer, staffed by friendly, knowledgeable people who take great pride in helping you find wines you’re going to love. The stores may evolve, the name may move on, but what makes us special won’t be going anywhere.

""You can still order online, through your branch or pop in and see us. It’s still us, with your favourite bottle on hand.""

He then went on to shed some light on the changes that will occur.

""The truth is the way you buy wine has moved on, and it’s time we did too,"" he said. ""Shopping for wine is incredibly different to how it was in the 1980s, when Majestic first began.

""So on the one hand we’re getting back to our roots, what made Majestic great back in the day, and we’re merging that with what wine lovers like you enjoy at Naked. It’s about bringing you the best of both companies; the experience, wines and people of Majestic with the ethos, community and support for independent winemakers of Naked. That means supporting real winemakers by selling real wines. We’re really excited about this.

""We also promise there will be: more tastings, more personalised service and more ways to find your next favourite wine. A specialist wine range – like the one which made Majestic famous in the first place.

""Finally, we know you love wine, but don’t always love shopping for wine. So we want to make it easier for you to find wines that you will love – and let you have them when you want.

""We’re still working on the final vision – and would love to hear your views. This has all come about because of what you have told us you want to see. Majestic, we think, is a pretty special place – and we want to evolve it to make it even better. Let me know your thoughts – j.lincoln@majestic.co.uk

""Thanks for taking the time to keep up to date with Majestic. We can’t wait to keep sharing our journey, our stories and, above all, our wine with you.""

Andrew Morgan founded the business as a concession at a farmers’ market in Kent back in 2010.

It developed into a small chain of independent beer merchants, with stores in London, Canterbury and Margate.

Optimism and ambition abounded after it raised £400,000 in a crowdfunding drive in 2017, with plans afoot to open two new retail sites in London.

However, wholesale was the larger side of the business and it lost a couple of key contracts. It has since struggled to stay afloat in a competitive market and administrators were today appointed to handle the liquidation of the business.

“We came incredibly close to agreeing an offer that would have not only saved the business but given us a very bright future but it didn’t happen,” said Morgan. “As the director, I had a legal obligation to discuss our finances with an insolvency firm once the deal fell through and today’s news is the result.

“Having succeeded on Crowdcube in 2017, we saw a major supplier drop us shortly afterwards and took 23% of our wholesale business with them. This was a torpedo blow to our forecasts and though the team valiantly and brilliantly battled to overcome this, when another top-three brewery dropped us with no notice last year, it didn’t help our situation.

“We brought on a consultant to help with this and quickly realised the extent of the financial legacy we were carrying from the breweries we’d lost. I set about finding a partner and came incredibly close to announcing something very positive but it wasn’t to be.

“This is small consolidation for those who are left with debts outstanding from the business. I know it’s going to have a knock-on effect within the industry and it’s a very tough environment for everyone out there.

“Having devoted over eight years of my life to this, being the biggest shareholder and lent the business money, I’m not immune to the reality of this situation but we all make choices and sometimes they don’t work out.

“However, as one Bottle Shop ex-employee said as they left the building, ‘at least nobody’s died’, which has stuck with me as something that I have to remember.

“We made a lot of people very happy since 2010 and hope that whoever ends up buying the business carries on our desire to burn brightly and never settle for anything other than the best. Huge thanks to everyone who helped on our journey – staff, customers and breweries. We had some great times and it’s incredibly sad for us to end like this.”

Gin has long been the star performer in the drinks industry and volume sales grew 41% in 2018 (Nielsen and CGA).

Many analysts credit the gin craze for boosting Fever-Tree’s fortunes, but the premium tonic supplier could just as easily be credited for fuelling the gin boom in the first place.

Fever-Tree helped the humble gin and tonic achieve a luxurious status among consumers and both continue to reap the rewards.

Revenue was up 40% to £237.4 million in 2018 and adjusted EBITDA grew 34% to £78.6 million, it revealed as it delivered its preliminary reports today.

Co-founder and chief executive Tim Warrillow said: “2018 was a significant year for Fever-Tree. In the UK, we strengthened our position as the leading mixer brand in the off-trade [IRI]. In the US, we successfully established our own operations and the business made real progress in deepening and widening its presence in multiple European regions.

“As the world’s leading premium mixer brand with a strengthening global distribution network we are well set to drive the international opportunity as the move towards the premium long mixed drink continues to gather momentum around the world.

“At this early stage in the year, the group is trading in line with board expectations and we remain excited about the size of the opportunity that lies ahead.”

Despite the apparently strong results, the City was initially unimpressed by Fever-Tree’s 2018 performance. Shares in the company fell by as much as 8% early Tuesday. However, it soon recovered and by 1.30pm its share price was 2651.2p, up from 2551.9p at the close of trading on Monday.

It retains a market cap north of £3 billion, which is larger than that of Britvic.

Its gross profit margin did shrink from 53.5% in 2017 to 51.8% in 2018, and some analysts blamed the introduction of the sugar tax for this fall.

DRN caught up with Julie Poirot, deputy agricultural counsellor at the French Embassy in London, on stage at an Agile Media event called Think France yesterday.

We discussed France’s preparations for Brexit, issues surround FX, confidence in the UK market and the existence of Nathalie Loiseau’s cat.

The French wine industry is taking precautions to ensure minimal disruption of supply to the UK while fears around movement of goods and tariffs abound, and overstocking in volume commonplace.

“In the wine sector, it’s quite different to other agricultural sectors,” said Poirot, who was born and raised in the heart of the Burgundy region. “People have the possibility of stockpiling, which is an easy way to face the first weeks of uncertainty. We have seen a lot of increases of shipments to the UK recently. In January we saw a 30% increase of shipments to the UK of wine and 50% increase in shipments of Champagne, so I just hope we will have a very good occasion to celebrate something, whatever it is, and to drink all that wine that is stocked right now in the UK.”

Revoking Article 50 and deciding to remain in the UK would provide the greatest cause for celebration among the UK wine trade, as our extensive industry surveys show that more than 90% vehemently oppose Brexit.

Yet the industry remains in the dark about what will happen, as does the French Embassy.

“We were a little bit astonished by Brexit,” said Poirot. “People thought it would not happen. Now we are on March 26 and we don’t know what’s going to happen. People have started to prepare for the worst, because that’s the easiest thing to do. If there is a no deal Brexit, we know the rules on both sides. There is a broad range of possibilities between [the UK] staying in the EU and a no deal Brexit, and we still don’t know which one will be implemented.

“From the administration and government point of view, we have held a lot of information meetings about Brexit. We have created a website called Brexit.gov.fr, with a lot of information about customs for the wine sector and other sectors. Still we are waiting for a clear decision from the UK government to really know what’s going to happen on April 12 or May 22.”

Some producers may fear that French wine will become unaffordable for many Brits if the value of the pound goes down significantly against the euro as a result of Brexit, and insurance against FX risk could be important for vignerons. Yet Poirot is convinced that French producers will find a way to maintain a strong trading relationship with the UK.

“The UK is our second largest market for French wine and it’s our fourth market for spirits, so it’s very, very important for us,” she said. “There is also a special relationship between France and the UK, because France is also the biggest [consumer] of Scotch whisky.

“Whether there will be a Brexit or not, or how or what kind of Brexit it is going to be, there will still be very strong relationships between our two countries regarding wine and spirits.

“We export French wines all over the world, to Asia, to North America. Of course it’s much easier to export French wines within the European Union and it’s easy with the UK, but this sector is used to dealing with the fluctuation of the currencies.

“Since the referendum there has been a decrease in the value of the pound, but this is something that the sector is used to dealing with in other markets. There is some insurance against currency fluctuation, but businesses are going to adapt.

“It might be difficult for a few weeks, and that’s where insurance can be useful, but stockpiling is another thing businesses can do to prepare themselves for any kind of Brexit. Businesses will find a way. We are still going to sell French wines in the UK, because you’re not one of our first export markets by chance, you are our closest neighbour, and I think British people really love French wines, so it’s not going to disappear.

“Of course, we are concerned about tariffs that could be offered to other countries like New Zealand and Australia. We know that there are very few agricultural attaches based in London and the two new ones are from New Zealand and Australia. We know that they are ready for this change, but I think we can manage that, because we export to the UK some quality wines that people are used to and really enjoy.”

Loiseau, France’s Europe Minister, has reportedly named her cat Brexit – because he is indecisive and reluctant to leave. “He wakes me up every morning miaowing to death because he wants to go out, and then when I open the door he stays in the middle, undecided, and then gives me evil looks when I put him out,” she said.

Yet Poirot was keen to reassure the wine trade that France still has confidence in the UK market. “She doesn’t have a cat,” she said. “It’s just a silly joke about Brexit.

“I think there is still confidence in the UK. Brexit is a challenge that businesses are facing, but it is manageable, because of the quality of our products. Having talked to the federation of French exporters of wine, we are still confident about the UK remaining one of our biggest markets.

“We have a lot of French importers based in the UK market, we have the connection, you are still just next door, and it’s much easier for us than for New Zealand and Australia, who are on the other side of the globe. We have some quality products. Brexit is a challenge, but it’s manageable.”

James Hickson founded the business in 2014 when he opened its flagship store in Balham in a bid to capitalise on Londoners’ growing love of craft beer.

The Clapham store flung its doors open the following year and a third site was launched in Tooting.

The store in Clapham has delighted Londoners with several garden parties, food matching events and educational sessions over the past three years, but We Brought Beer will no longer be bringing beer to the good people of Battersea. It claimed the landlord wants to sell the site for personal reasons.

“This is absolutely not something we wanted to happen, we are devastated to be leaving such a great location, but it's a decision that has been forced upon us by our landlord,” the retailer announced.

Its lease ends next month and it will then close its doors. We Brought Beer hoped to negotiate a new deal to stay on, but it claimed the landlord decided to raise the rent from £17,000 per year to £36,000 and insert a clause taking away the automatic renewal at the end of any deal.

“What this means is that, however well the site trades, the landlord could come along at the end of the term and kick us out with no recourse from our end,” it reported. “This level of uncertainty makes things very difficult for any business in terms of having confidence to invest for the long term in that location.

“These two factors were a massive double whammy for us and have made a great site simply unviable. It was not a decision we took lightly and it wasn’t one we wanted to have to make.

In the past week, The Bottle Shop and Beer Boutique have both been forced to close down their businesses.

The Bottle Shop has called in the administrators and made all employees redundant after sales dipped “well under forecast” during the winter trading period.

Last year, Beer Boutique announced it was joining forces with We Brought Beer to create the largest specialist beer retailer in the UK, under the parent company name Two Heads Beer Co, with a total of six stores and plans to expand the business.

But it has now been forced to go into voluntary liquidation and it will be closing all of its three stores with immediate effect.

The case of We Brought Beer is totally different, as it is not a result of poor trading, but it does point to a diminishing number of places for Londoners to buy intriguing craft brews.

However, Real Ale is opening a third store in Notting Hill this month.

The We Brought Beer stores in Balham and Tooting will continue trading and it may look at launching a third site somewhere else.

Isle of Wight distillery has invested in a six-figure redesign for its Mermaid gin and is gearing up to launch the first malt whisky from the island.

Head distiller, Xavier Baker, told DRN: “the first barrels of our malt whisky – the first ever from the Isle of Wight – were declared legally ‘whisky’ last December.

“It’s a unique recipe using a 9.2% abv un-hopped beer (known as ‘whisky wash’) recipe with barley grown by Island farmers. The whisky wash comes from the oldest brewery on the Island (Goddard’s), then moved to our Distillery for multiple distillations and placed in oak for the initial maturation process. It is now continuing to mature in a combination of bourbon and charred white wine casks at 63.5% abv (cask strength) before it is finished and rested.”

Mermaid gin has also had a major makeover in what Baker said was “a significant investment for a craft distillery like us”.

He added: “It’s more than a start-up would invest, but we already have a proven top quality and award-winning gin, so it was something we felt confident in. That investment has also covered a lot – not just the packaging – including significant sustainability improvements and market research.”

The project aimed to improve shelf standout, with the new-look bottle designed to have a wow factor.

“Signalling ‘premium’ was obviously important – but only because we now have a bottle that properly complements the quality of the gin inside. In short, there’s style to match the substance.”

The producer has plans for a new line to sit alongside the hand-crafted small batch Mermaid Gin, which it will reveal later on this year.

Mermaid uses ten botanical to create the gin, including local ones such as rock samphire, foraged from the Isle of Wight’s cliffs.

The distillery, which also produces a Navy Strength gin, a rum and a vodka, was set up in 2014 by Baker and winemaker Conrad Gauntlett.

It produced 70,000 bottles of gin in 2018 and it is doubling volumes each year.

It comes in two flavours – Lemon & Rosemary, and Rhubarb – and consumers are encouraged to be pour it over ice and serve it with a garnish.

The launch follows hot on the heels of a new Echo Falls “rosé wine and gin fusion” drink from Accolade Wines.

Gin has reigned supreme as the star performer in the UK drinks market for several years and the category grew volume sales by 41% in 2018.

It has well and truly shaken off its “mother’s ruin” tag and won over legions of new fans with fantastic brands and dynamic innovation.

Now the wine industry is bidding to capitalise on this momentum and drive some of its biggest brands back into growth.

Retailers are advised to display the 8.5% abv Blossom Hill Gin Fizz drinks in the sparkling wine bay, and neck tags will highlight the serving suggestion.

Bo Jakubenko, global marketing manager at TWE, said: “We know that gin is booming and that people are looking for refreshment and convenience from their drinks purchases. With Blossom Hill’s Gin Fizz we have developed a product that responds to this need.

“The launch further underlines our determination to modernize the Blossom Hill brand and to help make the wider wine category more relevant.

“By focusing on what the consumer wants and making wine more accessible via a fun, approachable brand like Blossom Hill, we are helping to ensure future category growth.”

TWE pledged to dedicate a £1 million war chest to marketing the new Gin Fizz brand, while the launch will be supported by in-store activations. A Gin Fizz Botanical Bus will also visit “high footfall events” in the UK during the summer.

It has already secured listings at Asda, Morrisons, the Co-op and Nisa, while Booker and other wholesalers have also taken it on.

Blossom Hill Gin Fizz has an rrp of £9, which is £4 more than the entry-level Echo Falls rosé and gin drink that Accolade has launched.

The company is a joint venture between industry veterans Ben Glaetzer (of Glaetzer Wines) and Nick Keukenmeester in Langhorne Creek, South Australia. Heartland was founded in 1999 with the aim of creating wines of balance, texture and a “distinctive Australian identity”, with a focus on Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz. The company also has a sustainable approach to viticulture.

Langhorne Creek is one of Australia’s oldest viticultural regions and the area is unique in South Australia due to its cool maritime climate and significant diurnal range. The result is a long growing season and this, combined with ancient alluvial soils, makes it particularly suited to Cabernet Sauvignon. The area boasts the oldest Cabernet Sauvignon vines in the world.

In addition to purchasing old-vine Cabernet Sauvignon And Shiraz from the region’s top growers, Heartland has also experimented successfully with plantings of Dolcetto and Lagrein, which make up a few of its unique blends.

Heartland’s wines are made at Glaetzer’s Barossa Vintners winery in Tanunda, Barossa.

Bancroft Wines’ chief executive, Jon Worsley, said: “Heartland is a natural fit for Bancroft’s portfolio – their wines are absolutely unique, with great quality throughout the range and a true commitment to sustainability. There is also a natural synergy with our agency Glaetzer Wines, as they share Ben Glaetzer as winemaker.

Keukenmeester said: “The UK market is vibrant and diverse, and we believe this is the perfect time to inject new energy into our presence here. We are thrilled to be working with a new partner whose passion for wine is at the heart of what they do. I am confident that Bancroft’s young and energetic team will help introduce Heartland to a new audience and really tell the story of our very special terroir.”",Bancroft Wines takes on Heartland Wines from Langhorne Creek

A new multimillion-pound TV ad campaign from Strongbow airs for the first time tonight, featuring friends in the pub singing Together in Electric Dreams.

Nielsen and CGA data for the year to January 2019 suggests that Strongbow has a 27% share of the cider market, with Strongbow Original and Strongbow Dark Fruit taking the top two spots in the bestseller chart.

Hall & Woodhouse is investing in a first ever outdoor campaign for its range of Badger beers.

The Tangle Foot bottle has emerged as a star SKU within the range, up 18% in value (Nielsen, year to February 2018), and it will feature on roadside ads across the UK.

The series of 48-sheet and 6-sheet adverts carry the strapline: “Whoever said you can’t buy great taste was lying.”

Digital screens of ads will be positioned outside 60 Tesco stores nationally, featuring a bottle of Fursty Ferret. The 48-sheet landscape posters will feature Tangle Foot in 30 “key urban sites nationally”, as well as 19 key roadside sites within Badger’s Dorset heartland.

Sarah Pace, Brand Manager at Badger Beer, said: “The campaign will also build on the relaunch of our brand just 10 months ago and continue to grow brand awareness, both nationally and within our Dorset heartland. With this awareness-boosting campaign we aim to increase our rate of trial and ultimately our own base of loyal customers.”

The campaign goes live on April 22, backed by social media advertising.

The Oxford versus Cambridge boat race takes place at the weekend and Wainright has signed on as the official beer partner.

This partnership will run until 2021, and it sees Wainright host a fan zone, while it has launched 350,000 promotional neck collars in the off-trade, showcasing an opportunity to win big as part of The Boat Race sponsorship.

Paul Freeman, senior marketing manager for Wainwright said: “This is a great new platform for Wainwright to be seen at an iconic national sporting day. We will get to be right in the mix of things on the day by mingling with the crowds and helping to be part of the celebration with them. Not only that, the Race also carries its own gravitas and with an estimated 250,000 spectators throughout the day, it is the start of an exciting step for Wainwright.”

Consumer spending in the grocery sector has continued to slow for the third consecutive month with sales up 1.2% in the last four weeks, below the predicted rate of 1.9% and down from 2.5% last month, according to the data.

The continued slowdown is being attributed to several factors including the increased costs of living from rises in energy and fuel prices, to the upcoming increase in council tax. Extended uncertainty over Brexit negotiations is also causing shoppers to tighten their grocery budgets.

The data shows shoppers are spending less at the ‘big four’ supermarket chains (Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Asda) and this has led to a rise in sales at the discounters Aldi and Lidl, whose combined market share in the last 12 weeks totalled a high of 16%. Over the same period the combined share of the top four supermarkets was 64.1% compared with 65.6% last year.

Analysts point to a more positive few weeks ahead with seasonal promotions expected to boost sales of drinks, as well as confectionery and snacks.

Mike Watkins, Nielsen’s UK head of retailer insight, said: “We can see that the last few weeks have continued to be challenging for retailers. However, there should be brighter times ahead, with Easter on the horizon bringing attractive seasonal promotions to encourage shoppers to spend more on confectionery, snacks and drinks. If this is accompanied by warm spring weather and more clarity over the status of Brexit, this will help to kick-start growth for the big supermarkets and boost sales in time for summer.”

Over the past 12 weeks the grocery retailers which recorded the biggest rises in sales (compared to the same 12 weeks in 2018) were Aldi (up 14.7%), Lidl (up 9.8%), Iceland (up 3.6%), The Co-op (up 2.5%) and Waitrose (up 1.2%).

The big four, and Marks & Spencer, struggled to grow sales over the period, compared to 2018.

Watkins said: “The first quarter of 2019 has shown a continued slowdown in consumer spending on grocery, with the average household spend each week on groceries amounting to £71, back to the level last seen in October 2017.

“This means that grocery spend remains broadly unchanged in the last 18 months despite inflation. We can see a change in shopping behaviour as well as a shift in sentiment as households shop around to make savings.”

Parents employed by Diageo in the UK will be eligible for the same fully-paid 26 weeks, retaining benefits and bonuses regardless of gender, sexual orientation or whether they become parents biologically, via surrogacy or adopt.

The move forms part of Diageo’s strategy to support gender equality and to create a fully inclusive and diverse workforce, where barriers to career progression are removed and talent is retained and nurtured.

Mairéad Nayager, Chief HR Officer at Diageo said: “True gender equality in the working world requires fundamental changes to a broad range of working practices, including a shake-up of the policies and cultural norms around parental leave. Today’s announcement is about matching ambition with action and supporting all of our colleagues – regardless of gender - to experience the joy of raising a young family, while continuing to thrive at work.”

Minister for Women and Equalities, Penny Mordaunt, said: “I’m delighted to see Diageo making this move. Shared parental leave gives both mums and dads the chance to spend quality time with their child in the important first months of their life, creating a bond that will last a lifetime.

“Employers can reap the benefits too. We know that flexibility in work is proven to create happier, more loyal and more productive workforces.

“Action like this is exactly what we are encouraging as part of our forthcoming strategy which will aim to empower every woman in the UK to achieve their true potential.”

The new policy also strengthens the support for parents as they return to work including the option of keeping in touch days, parental coaching, flexible working policies and access to free independent counselling.

The independent drinks producer said it sold around 60 million drinks for the year ending September 30, 2018, and its new premium canned cocktail range – All Shook Up – exceeded targets by selling more than two million cans in just ten months.

It also pointed to strong sales of its Franklin & Sons tonics, mixer and soft drinks range driven by the trend for low and no alcohol.

The sales growth follows a 16% rise in sales for the previous financial year (2016 – 2017) and the company said it also saw gross profit rise from £11.8 million to £14 million for 2017 to 2018.

Founder and chairman, Steve Perez, said: “The drinks industry is so strangled by needless bureaucracy, it limits original ideas. Our company growth is being driven by an innovative and entrepreneurial team that’s encouraged to do things differently. They’re constantly looking at how they can create new drinks that justify a place on supermarket shelves and in the fridges of bars, late-night venues and restaurants around the world.

“The team’s innovative thinking is rooted in what consumers want and working with our customers to quickly meet demand. It led to the creation of premium canned cocktail All Shook Up, which is now a top seller in one of the UK’s largest supermarkets.

“Drinkstragramming and other social media trends mean drinks now need to look as good as they taste. This drives sales. Premium quality tasting drinks, packaged in sleek and stylish cans meant that we exceeded original sales targets for All Shook Up, selling more than 2 million cans in just ten months following launch.”

The success of All Shook Up saw Global Brands add a third canned cocktail – Flamingo Colada – to the original lime-up of two flavours; Passionfruit Martini and Espresso Martini.

The company also added to its Franklin & Sons range with its Flavour Collection (four-dual flavoured tonics) and three infused sodas were also added. The range saw total sales volumes grow by 101% for the year ending September 30, 2018.

Global Brands was founded in 1997 and its products are now sold in 58 countries.

Perez said: “The low and no-alcohol, mindful drinking trend is growing, and consumers want soft drinks that offer depth of flavour and the same experience as an alcoholic serve. The Infused Sodas do this. The three flavours in the range are based on the complexities and finish of a high-end cocktail and they have been created to be served over ice, in a tall wine glass and with a fruit garnish. People opting for no-alcohol choices don’t want second-rate drinks.”

The Infused Sodas are just 49 calories per 27.5cl bottle and come in three unique flavours; Fragrant Guava & Persian Lime with Root Ginger, Exotic Pineapple & Aromatic Cardamom with Cracked Cubeb Pepper, and Succulent Pomegranate & Floral Hibiscus with Delicate Rose.

He added: “The company was founded on innovation and entrepreneurialism with the creation of vodka-based Ready To Drink (RTD) VK. It’s 20 years this year since we sold our first bottle of the RTD and it’s more popular than ever – it’s the best-selling drink of its type in bars and late-night venues across the UK and we sold over 28 million bottles of VK in the on and off trade last year.”

A new contender in the alcohol-free spirits and liqueurs category has already secured a listing with Sainsbury’s.

Everleaf is a non-alcoholic aperitif, which is made from 18 different plants, all of which are sustainably sourced. The drink is designed to be mixed with soda water or tonic to create a refreshing spritz drink. It can also work as a base for cocktails or sipped neat over ice.

The drink is the brainchild of bartender and conservation biologist, Paul Mathew. He said: “In Everleaf, I wanted to make an exceptional non-alcoholic products firstly to give people more choice when they don’t necessarily want to drink, but also to reflect the concept of sustainability – sustainable consumption as well as ingredients that are responsibly sourced. The fact Sainsbury’s has got behind us as a small, bartender-owned brand is testament to the growing desire for credible, non-alcoholic alternatives.”

Mathew spent a year researching and sourcing plants, dehydrating samples, macerating and extracting to perfect Everleaf’s recipe and flavours, while ensuring the ingredients are sourced ethically and sustainably. The ingredients include vanilla and saffron for richness, gentian and iris for bitterness and earthy warmth, plus vetiver and orange blossom for freshness and vibrancy.

Everleaf also contains voodoo lily (konjac), which gives it a “silky mouthfeel”.

The 0.4% abv brew is said to retain a bready sweetness and bitter finish as the team decided to dry hop with Citra and Amarillo.

The beer has already launched in Sweden and distributor Carlsberg UK believes it can carve out a strong share of the growing alcohol-free beer market on our shores.

“There has been a clear cultural shift in the UK towards moderation, with drinkers seeing low and no alcohol options as more ‘socially acceptable,” said marketing director Jonathan Dee. “This has created an opportunity for non-alcoholic alternatives from trusted and recognised brands.”

Long gone are the days when Becks Blue dominated the market and there was little choice beyond that. Carlsberg UK also has San Miguel 0.0% in its portfolio, while many other leading brewers have jumped on the bandwagon.

While Brooklyn Special Effects is 0.4% abv, that is still classed as alcohol-free, as that is the sort of alcohol level you might find in everyday drinks like orange juice.

Brewdog’s Nanny State is 0.5% abv and it is now the fourth bestselling beer in this category, according to IRI data.

Becks Blue is still the market leader, with a 34.9% market share. Sales are broadly flat at £17.2 million for this popular brew. Brand owner AB InBev has also launched Budweiser Prohibition Brew, which is up to fifth in the chart, with annual sales of £3.7 million.

Heineken launched a £6 million marketing campaign for its 0.0% abv variant last year and it is now the second bestselling beer in this category, with annual sales of £8 million. A category stalwart, Bavaria Non Alcoholic, is third, with £6.2 million in annual sales.

Erdinger Non Alcoholic is sixth in the chart and St Peter’s Without, Warsteiner Fresh, Cobra Zero, Franziskaner Weissbier, Estrella Free Dam, Adnams Ghost Ship Alcohol Free, St Peter’s Without Gold, Shandy Carib, Open Gate Pure Brew, Infinite Session Pale, Kaliber, Brewdog Raspberry Blitz and Big Drop Pale Ale complete the top 20.

Many of them are new launches, and we have recently seen the likes of Peroni Libera join the market, so there are no signs of this dynamic category slowing down any time soon.

The Irish whiskey industry worked with the Department of Agriculture, Food and The Marine to submit the Irish whiskey technical file in 2014. The file defines the distinctive types of Irish whiskey and their unique production methods.

Carleen Madigan, Legal Advisor to the Irish Whiskey Association (IWA), said: “This week’s announcement by the European Commission marks the approval of the Irish Whiskey technical file. This is momentous achievement for the Irish whiskey industry and ensures that the traditions and high standards of the Irish whiskey category will be protected in the EU and globally in markets with which the EU has a trade agreement.

“As sales of Irish whiskey continue to boom globally, we have seen a trebling in the complains to the Association regarding fake Irish whiskey around the world. The Geographic Indication provides the strongest possible protection against these infringements and gives us the basis for enforcement action against misleading products.”

The announcement also confirms GI protection for Irish Cream (Liqueur) and Irish Poitin.

Vincent McGovern, head of the Irish Spirits Association, said: “This week’s announcement was likewise of great significance to both Irish Cream and Irish Poitin as their Technical Files were also approved. Both categories will benefit from the strong protection and higher profile a European Geographic Indication provides at home, across the Internal Market and in export markets worldwide.”

Under a 2008 EU Spirit Regulation, member states were required to submit to the European Commission a comprehensive technical file for each GI registered, by February 2015. These files outline the production methods, ingredients and links with the geographical area in question. The technical file submitted by the Irish whiskey industry defined the distinctive types of Irish whiskey, Malt Irish Whiskey, Pot Still Irish Whiskey, Grain Irish Whiskey and Blended Irish Whiskey for the first time and set out their unique production methods.

Otakar Brut Lager has been brewed by Roger Ryman, the head brewer at family-owned St Austell, and Petr Skocek, co-founder and head brewer of London-based Bohem Brewery, which brews authentic Bohemian-style lagers on bespoke brewing equipment from the Czech Republic.

To create the brew Ryman transported the yeast used to brew St Austell Brewery’s Korev lager to Bohem in London. The recipe, originally developed for a one-off beer called Korev Brut, was given a new twist by being brewed by Ryman and Skocek on Bohem’s special decoction brewing kit.

The result is Otakar Brut Lager, a 6.4% abv beer authentically lagered at low temperature for six weeks. The beer is named after several King Otakars who ruled Bohemia, which is today within the Czech Republic. The beer is made with Pilsner, Cara Gold, Acid Malt and maize, along with Magnum, Hersbrucker and Saaz hops, as well as Nelson Sauvin for dry hopping.

Ryman said: “Although I’ve been brewing for many years, this was the first time I’d made a decoction mash. It was very interesting to work with Petr and the team to create a unique beer which we hope lager enthusiasts will enjoy.”

Skocek said: “Britain and the Czech Republic both have great brewing traditions, and we were delighted to welcome Roger to London for his first decoction brewing experience. We hope both St Austell and Bohem beer lovers will enjoy Otakar while it’s available.

“Decoction brewing is a traditional European brewing style which sees part of the mash boiled, and returned to the main mash to raise the temperature. The process adds the depth, complexity and flavour which characterizes authentic Czech lagers.”

Otakar will be available in both keg and can through Bohem’s distribution partnership with beer wholesaler The Bottle Shop.

Yalumba launches new range to celebrate Barossa varieties and blends

Yalumba has launched a collection of wines designed to act as the gateway to the producer’s premium wine portfolio.

Samuel’s Collection, named after the brand’s founder Samuel Smith, consists of seven fine wines showcasing varieties and blends iconic to both Barossa and Yalumba.

The wines represent the varietals that Barossa is known for, together with “Yalumba’s winemaking thumbprint” that has been refined throughout its 170-year history.

Head of winemaking, Louisa Rose, said: “Understanding that wine drinkers are seeking more youthful, generous and fresher wines, we have crafted Samuel’s Collection to fit this style, while still showing the hallmarks expressed in the Yalumba winemaking philosophy.”

Samuel’s Collection – which are all sustainably grown and vegan-friendly – are available now in the UK market.

Australia recently reported a rise in exports to the UK with volume exports up 10% to 27.3 million 9-litre cases in the past year.

The UK remains the leading importer of Australian wine by volume, but it is third in value after China and the US, however value exports also grew – by 12% - to AU$389 million (£215 million).

Around 90% of Australian wines are sold below £7 per bottle but premium wines are in growth with wines priced at £8-9 up 23%, and £9-10 per bottle up 16%.",Yalumba launches new range to celebrate Barossa varieties and blends

Hammonds of Knutsford is working with The Cartmel Spirit Company to launch Belgrove Rum in the UK.

The premium, single-origin rum, is distilled from pure Demerara sugar cane grown on the mineral-rich banks of the Demerara River in Guyana. It is then infused with notes of toasted hazelnut, a touch of Madagascan vanilla and undertones of chocolate.

Hammonds has been confirmed as Belgrove’s first nationwide distributor.

Jonathan Hammond, managing director, said: “When the Carmel Spirits Company first introduced us to Belgrove we were impressed with the luxurious quality of the spirit, as well as the unique flavour offering.

“We are delighted to be working with Belgrove during such an exciting time for the brand, and to be bringing such a luxurious product to our customers in the hospitality sector, from nationwide accounts, to local independent bars.”

Belgrove is available via Amazon and also from the House of Malt.

Founder, Edmund Wood, said: “Belgrove has been a labour of love for us. We have been dedicated to creating an innovative yet authentic rum and I am delighted to be introducing Belgrove to cocktail fans everywhere.

“We have worked extensively to develop the product and brand to create a rum that is a real taste of luxury, and our distribution partnership will enable us to reach new customers across the country and create a real buzz around the launch.”

As Britain prepares to leave the EU, independent drinks retailer Thirsty Cambridge and Bristol-based brewer Moor Beer have teamed up to bring producers from across Europe together for a craft beer collaboration project.

The Citizens of Everywhere project brings together 12 UK brewers with 12 from across the EU for a dozen beers that will each celebrate a significant EU achievement. They represent the 12 stars on the European flag.

Moor itself is working with Italian brewer Lambrate on a beer to recognise cross-cultural collaboration.

Other tie-ups in the project include North Brewing of Leeds pairing with Stu Mostów of Poland on a beer to celebrate peace in Western Europe and Derbyshire’s Thornbridge linking with Belgian brewer Brasserie de la Senne on a brew to mark scientific and technological cooperation.

Belfast-based Boundary and White Hag from the Irish Republic are teamed up on an “ease of travel” beer.

The other brewery pairings are: Five Points (London) and Bevog (Austria); Fyne Ales (Argyll) and Beerbliotek (Sweden); Gipsy Hill (London) and To Øl (Denmark); Lost & Grounded (Bristol) and Mahrs (Germany); Northern Monk (Leeds) and Guineu (Spain); Ramsgate (Kent) and Põhjala (Estonia); Siren (Berkshire) and Kees (Netherlands); and Tiny Rebel (Newport) and Mont Salève (France).

The beers – which will all be made using only European hops – will be launched at a number of events on March 22, a week before the UK is officially due to leave the EU.

Thirsty Cambridge founder Sam Owens said: “Back in October 2016, the Prime Minister said ‘If you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere’.

“As someone who considers himself very much a citizen of the world, I wanted to turn that statement around in a positive way.

“What could be more beautiful than uniting people, businesses and countries to brew wonderful beer?

“This is a fantastic demonstration of the UK and EU working together, all the way from the growers to the manufacturers, distributors, retailers and consumers.

“That is well worth raising a glass to and considering why we need to continue working together.”

Justin Hawke, the US-born owner of Moor, said: “As someone who chose to move to Europe and start my brewery in the UK, this topic is hugely personal.

“It was crucial for us to avoid a negative, antagonistic tone in what we’re doing.

“Sure, we believe strongly that it’s a bad idea to leave the EU, but we don’t want to be political.

“At the heart of everything we’re doing is a positive message celebrating all the great things that can be achieved by working together.

“This project uses beer as a medium for people to really internalise how we must continue building bridges as people, as businesses and as nations.”

Denbies Wine Estate is expected to increase its winery workforce by a third by the end of 2019 due to an increase in production.

England’s largest single estate vineyard is already part-way through a major investment programme to span the next three years, creating multiple new employment opportunities, it said.

Phase one of the winery expansion programme was completed at the start of April with the installation of the new fully automated disgorging line and riddling cages. This represents a “huge increase in production capacity” for its sparkling wines, according to Denbies.

The new line means production speed has been increased fourfold, giving the winery the opportunity to produce and process a larger quantity of Denbies’ own wine. The automated machine also has the capacity to disgorge both half bottles and magnums.

Denbies is one of only a few wineries in the south-east of England to offer contract disgorging facilities for other English vineyards.

Winery expansion will continue into 2021 with increased tank capacity and increased cellar storage.

Christopher White, Denbies chief executive, said: “The demand for contract winemaking solutions has grown exponentially over the past 10 years with the growth of vineyard plantings in the UK. This new equipment will enable us to quadruple our sparkling wine production capacity by the end of 2019.

""Moreover, our programme of new plantings, and planned winery investments will enable us to expand, while continuing to drive the quality of our sparkling wines. The additional winery expansion programme will also ensure that we support growing demand for our full range of still wines, from entry level up to the premium ranges.”

Denbies carbon neutral 17 bedroom Vineyard Hotel is also on track to open in summer 2019.

The company, which is based in Dorking, currently produces more than 450,000 bottles of wine per year. It currently has 265 acres under vine, which is 10% of the UK's plantings. The first vines were planted on the estate in 1986.

The North Wales whisky distillery, which has only been producing new-make malt spirit since January 2018, will add the rye whisky, once mature, as a permanent addition to its whisky portfolio, available from 2020.

James Wright, managing director at Aber Falls, said: “Distilling rye whisky marks a significant milestone in the development of Aber Falls’ future whisky portfolio. Our ambition is to build a portfolio which is fit for the next five, ten, 15, 20 years and to unlock new drinking experiences for consumers.

“The addition of a rye whisky allows us to bring into the fold whisky drinkers beginning their journey of experimentation. This versatile liquid is the perfect stepping-stone to go onto explore single malts.

“Not only to de want to put Wales on the world whisky map, but we also want Aber Falls to be the home of innovative whiskies. As such, we are continually experimenting with everything from different types of grains through to our cask selection, in order to deliver new and interesting flavour profiles for whisky lovers.”

In December 2018 the distillery added a Premium Small-Batch Welsh Gin to its portfolio. The Premium variant joined others in the gin collection, including Welsh Dry Gin, Rhubarb & Ginger Gin, Orange Marmalade Gin and a selection of gin liqueurs.

Foss, who is half-French and Bordeaux-trained, started his career by managing the family vineyard in the Entre-Deux-Mers region and worked in Sauternes (Chateau d’Yquem) and St Emillion, before becoming winemaker for the GFA Leclerc vineyard group.

After this he returned to England and enrolled on a teacher-training course. He was later able to merge his two passions of wine and education when Plumpton College announced it planned to start a wine production programme.

The programme is now recognised as an international centre of excellence in wine training, education and research with a team of 12 specialists delivering courses to more than 100 undergraduates, 30 Master students and the English wine industry (through the WineSkills training initiative), plus a successful commercial wine brand, Plumpton Wine Estate, produced in Plumpton’s own 10-hectare vineyard.

Foss has also been Chairman of the South East Vineyards Association (SEVA) for 10 year, and he is Chair of the Wine GB Environmental Sustainability Workgroup and a Wine GB Southeast committee member. He is also a member of the Life+ ADVIClim research group, and led the team that designed the academic programme for the ninth international Cool Climate Wine Symposium, held in Brighton in May 2016.

Jeremy Kerswell, principle of Plumpton College, said: “Chris has literally been at the heart of everything to do with the incredible success of the college’s wine industry for over thirty years, and in that time has fully established us as one of the leading education and research centres globally. The work that Chris has led has undoubtedly been one of the drivers behind the success of the English and Welsh wine industry in recent years, with his graduates now employed all over the world.

“He leaves an incredible legacy, and a team and resource base we are only keen to invest in further to ensure we stay at the heart of the future of the industry.”

Foss intends to remain engaged post-retirement and will continue working in climate change and vineyard sustainability.

Cellar Trends is launching two non-alcoholic brands in order to tap into this “seemingly unstoppable” consumer trend. The company also has a number of other launches and line extensions in the pipeline.

The first of its non-alcohol brands is Fluere, described as being “filled with botanicals to provide a complex yet balanced taste”. These are individually distilled in a copper pot still using hydrosteam distillation.

The second launch is Cosmopolitan Diva, a fruit fusion sparkling non-alcoholic drink. The core range under this brand includes Peach, Berry and Melon at 5.5% abv, as well as a new non-alcoholic version created from grape juice at 46 calories per serve, and targeting a predominantly female audience.

Geoff Watts, managing director, said: “The non-alcoholic segment is one that has taken the industry by surprise and seems unstoppable as consumer trends continue to fuel its growth. The category has seen an additional 620,000 shoppers this year and has a predicted growth rate of 81.1% from 2018 to 2022.”

The company also has new products to tap into the continued popularity of the gin category.

Watts said: “The gin category continues its meteoric rise, retaining its position as the fastest growing sector within spirits and boasting a value that has doubled over the last two years to over £2.1 billion. As a result customers now demand a range of gins, so Cellar Trends has added a new and disruptive brand to the existing portfolio.”

The new gin is Mcqueen and Violet Fog, which is the latest brand to be released from Sovereign brands. The gin is handcrafted in Brazil, and it is “like no gin on Earth”, distilled with 21 botanicals gathered from all over the world, including six signature botanicals including Basil and Acai.

Cellar Trends is also adding premium rums – Bumbu XO, Pusser’s 15 year-old and Bayou Single Barrel – to its portfolio. It also now has a trio of Muyu Liqueurs, made with natural ingredients.

Watts said: “We are delighted to be adding this range of brands to our portfolio for the coming year. The drinks industry has been a hive of innovation in recent years and these brands will all play their part in pushing the sector forwards.”

Full year pre-tax profits for Britain’s biggest supermarket were £1.67 billion (up 28.8%) while same store sales for Tesco grew 1.7%.

Chief executive Dave Lewis said the group was on track to meet the “vast majority” of the turnaround goals he set when he was appointed four years ago, following a major accounting scandal at the company.

He said: “After four years we have met, or are about to meet, the vast majority of our turnaround goals. I am very confident that we will complete the journey in 2019/ 2020.”

Lewis oversaw the takeover of wholesaler Booker in 2017. He also launched a discount chain – Jack’s – to take on the discounters Aldi and Lidl, and Tesco said it has had a “strong response” from the eight new stores.

Booker “bulk buys” are already being offered in a number of Tesco stores and this will be expanded this year, while more Jack’s stores are also in the pipeline, with seven planned for this year alone.

Over the past year Tesco also re-launched 10,000 own brand products and introduced eight new ‘Exclusively at Tesco’ brands.

The company also reported an increase in customer numbers – up by an estimated 149,000 this year.

Lewis said: “We have restored our competitiveness for customers – including through the introduction of ‘Exclusively at Tesco’ – and rebuilt a sustainable base of profitability.”

The retailer stil faces a difficult trading environment with the uncertainty of Brexit looming as well as the potential merger of Sainsbury's and Asda.

The global campaign was launched in December last year but the ASA received six complaints about the ads potentially linking alcohol with daring, toughness or irresponsible behaviour.

The adverts, which ran on TV, video on demand (VOD) and Instagram, featured a man leaping off a cliff and tumbling towards the ground. As he fell, feathers started sprouting out of his arms and he began to grow wings. On-screen text stated “Would you risk falling…. for a chance to fly?” The advert later showed the man flying upwards once his wings were fully-grown. An end-frame featured the text stating “The Macallan. Make the call”, which was accompanied by an image of the whisky product in the glass.

The ASA said that while it noted some elements of the ad were fantastical, “we considered, nevertheless, that the central message of the ad, which was explicitly highlighted through the tagline, was one of promoting risky or daring behaviour to reap possible rewards. Although the character was not seen consuming alcohol at any point, we considered the ads made a clear association between an alcoholic product and potentially very dangerous, daring behaviour, and concluded that they were irresponsible”.

Edrington Distillers, the producer of The Macallen, explained that the line ‘MakeThe Call’ was used globally to describe the brand’s philosophy and it was used in relation to the decisions that the brand had made in its own history, and was also relevant to the audience’s decisions made in their own lives.

The company said it did not believe the ads were irresponsible, or linked alcohol to bravery, daring or toughness and pointed out “the ads did not show anyone consuming alcohol”.

It also said the fantastical winged man featured in the ads was not seen to undertake risky behaviour, or to be more adept at doing so, because he had been drinking. And he was also not seen being rewarded by any alcohol after his feat. It said: “The story was simply a metaphor about making decisions.”

Edrington said it had worked closely with the relevant bodies including ITV and Instagram, who had deemed the campaign to be acceptable.

In light of the new ASA ruling the company has removed the campaign from channels accessible by the UK audience and said it would take on board the ruling as it plans for the next phase of the campaign.

Bacardi Spiced, which follows last year’s newcomers Bacardi Ginger and Bacardi Raspberry, is made with gold rum mellowed in charred American Oak, to add a hint of smokiness, and blended with natural flavours and spices. The producer also said it is made without using artificial sweeteners.

Tine Van Nevel, brand director – Europe, said: “The decision to introduce a spiced blend into our rum portfolio was a natural one as consumers have shown demand is there. We are confident Bacardi Spiced will satisfy the taste buds of long-time spiced rum drinkers as well as converting some new fans with its unique combination of spices and flavours.”

Bacardi Spiced has an initial exclusive listing with Tesco, where it is priced at £15.99, before rolling out to all major UK retailers from April 2019.

The launch offers Bacardi fans an option to extend into a spiced rum while staying within the Bacardi portfolio.

Circumstance Distillery has revealed its first release and the spirit, called Circumstantial Barley, is made from 100% malted British barley fermented for 13 days on a bed of French saison yeast and distillers yeast.

Co-founder, Danny Walker, said: “This first release is quite a milestone. We have thrown out the rule book and are focussing on flavour over tradition and experimenting with every step of the process to make a ‘new world’ style spirit.”

The result is described as “a vibrant spirit: malty with notes of green spice, stone fruit, citrus and umami”.

Head distiller, Mark Scott, said: “At Circumstance Distillery we are entirely flavour focussed, and ‘Circumstantial Barley’ is a perfect introduction to our ethos. It was distilled through a whisky hood and 4-plate column before ageing for six months on a combination of charred bespoke oak spindles and first-fill bourbon casks. The result is a beautiful raw spirit and our short ageing techniques allows the quality of the raw spirit to shine through.”

The team is now busy working on some “big ryes” and “unashamedly funky” white rum.

Co-founder, Liam Hirt, said: “We produce ‘new world’ styles of grain spirits and cane spirits. We are taking inspiration from early beer fermentation and traditional wine maturation right through to modern American craft distillation to create something completely unique.”

Circumstantial Barley will be bottled in 70cl bottles with an abv of 45% and it will retail at £44.

Young will be based at the Hare Brewery in Warmley, which is located on the outskirts of Bristol, eight miles northwest of Bath.

She will be in charge of the Bath Ales portfolio and report to Roger Ryman, brewing director for St Austell.

“I’m delighted to be heading back to my home town of Bristol,” she said. “It’s where my parents and sister still live and it’s something I’ve been mulling over for some time, so when a great brewer like St Austell offered me such a fantastic opportunity, I just couldn’t say no.”

Young began her career at Fuller’s back in 1999, under the tutelage of legendary brewer John Keeling. In 2017, he stepped down as head brewer and handed the reins to her.

During her time at Fuller’s, Young created a diverse range of brands, including Frontier, Honey Dew and Jack Frost. She also supervised a high-profile collaboration project called Fuller’s and Friends that saw it team up with exciting craft counterparts Fourpure, Cloudwater, Moor, Marble, Thornbridge and Hardknott to make limited-edition brews.

Before joining Fuller’s, she worked at Smiles Brewery in her hometown of Bristol, alongside Richard Dempster, one of the founders of Bath Ales, along with a stint at

the Brewing Research Institute before joining Fuller’s as a Production Brewer in 1999.

Cornish brewery St Austell purchased Bath Ales for an undisclosed sum in 2016, taking on its portfolio of brands and an 11-strong pub estate.

Young will be tasked with taking the Bath Ales name in an exciting new direction.

“The role at Bath Ales will allow me to take total control of the operation, including brewing and packaging, which gives me a new challenge,” she said. It’s sad to be leaving Fuller’s after all these years, but I’ve left a first class brewing team at Chiswick and I know they will flourish in the future.”

Fuller’s just sold its beer division to Asahi in a £250 million deal. Beer writer Roger Protz said he was “dumfounded”, while fellow writer Pete Brown declared the industry had lost romance, heritage and magic as a result of the news.

Since St Austell purchased Bath Ales it has doubled in capacity and it now has the ability to produce 14.5 million pints per year. Newer brews include Lansdown West Coast IPA and Sulis, its first lager. It moved into Hare Brewery in 2018 and this new brewhouse also has a taproom.

James Staughton, chief executive at St Austell Brewery, said: “We couldn’t be more delighted that George is taking the helm as Head Brewer at our Hare Brewery in Warmley. We look forward to welcoming her and to exciting times ahead, as George helps us to realise the full potential of the Bath Ales beer brands.”

Ryman added: “George and I have known each other for many years, both as brewers and friends. I’m therefore hugely excited that she’ll be joining our brewing and production team at Hare Brewery. I look forward to working and brewing alongside her in the years to come.”",Georgina Young leaves Fuller's for Bath Ales

Fortress is reported to now be in the race along with OpCapita and other bidders to acquire the retail estate from Majestic, following the wine company’s recent announcement that it plans to focus on its Naked Wines digital arm,

Majestic, which is due to provide a trading update next month, aims to sell its stores – totaling around 200 – to help inject cash into its Naked Wines business, a strategy that also includes changing the corporate name to Naked Wines.

Fortress Investment Group is involved in a number of businesses, predominantly in the US. It is the parent company of the Brightline (now Virgin Trains USA), Mystay Hotels and resorts in Japan and it owns Canadian ski resort operator Intrawest. It is involved in RailAmerica, Penn National Gaming (an operator of casinos and horse racing venues) and it has a big private equity portfolio.

Earlier this month it was revealed that OpCapita, which owned Comet, was also one of the bidders vying for Majestic’s retail estate.

A number of investors are reported to be interested in buying the Majestic Wines’ 200-strong retail estate, following the announcement in March that the company plans to change its corporate name to Naked Wines with increased focus on its online business.

Private equity firm OpCapita, the former owner of the Comet retail business, is among a number of potential bidders for Majestic Wines’ network of stores and it is believed to in competition with a US-based investor, as well as another business, who are all interested in buying the Majestic chain.

Majestic is expected to use the profits from the sale of its stores to inject growth into its Naked Wines business.

The sale of the stores is being handled by advisers at Rothschild and it is believed the company hopes to secure a deal – with an asking price of at least £100 million - before it announces its latest financial results in June.

The Majestic retail arm comprises an estate of about 200 stores.

The Wine & Spirit Education Trust (WSET) has announced its Level 3 Award in Spirits is now live, with the first courses in the UK and USA now open for booking.

The award has been developed in response to the global growth of the spirits industry and resulting demand for advanced level, brand-neutral spirits category knowledge.

The new qualification will build on the Level 2 Award in Spirits, providing greater detail on production choices and their impact on style and quality. It will also cover a broader spectrum of world spirits, including the key Asian spirits: Shochu, Baiju and Soju.

Content for the course includes technical information covering the principles of production – from creating a sugary liquid to fermentation, distillation and post-distillation options – and in-depth coverage of the Scotch, Cognac, Caribbean Rum, Armagnac, Mezcal, Vodka and Gin categories.

As with other WSET level 3 qualifications, the exam will include both a blind tasting exam and a written paper comprising multiple-choice and short written answer questions. The course requires a minimum of 84 hours study time.

Course developer Nick King DipWSET, said: “The spirits industry has been crying out for a more advanced qualification in spirits. Candidate numbers for WSET spirits qualifications (Levels 1 and 2) have grown significantly in the last 10 years (from 540 in 2009 to 6600 in 2019) and are now taught in 33 countries worldwide reflecting growing global demand.

""We are delighted to now be able to offer the industry a Level 3 Spirits qualification that develops candidates’ knowledge and understanding of the category in great depth and also builds their tasting skills, teaching them to identify the structural and aromatic elements that make up a spirit and to make a compelling quality assessment.”

Winchester Distillery is on track to reach its £375,000 crowdfunding target with more than 65% of funding achieved one month before the deadline.

The business, which is now five years old, has raised more than £240,000 to help fund expansion plans.

The campaign was in ‘private mode’ on Crowdcube, meaning it was only open to followers of Winchester Distillery, with the aim of reaching 20% of the overall amount. The pitch will now go public on the Crowdcube website.

The external investment is being sought by the company to increase production of its premium spirits, install a brewhouse, further develop its whisky and rum, increase marketing activity, look into export opportunities and also open an onsite gift shop.

Founder, Paul Bowler, said: “The news that our supporters have pledged almost quarter of a million pounds, plus the overwhelming amount of support we have received over the last month, has been the best fifth birthday present for Winchester Distillery. We are really excited that our Crowdcube campaign will be open to all later this week and that we are another step closer to being able to proceed with our expansion plans.”

Chapel Down is part of the Kent group Wine Garden of England, and managing director Mark Harvey said its primary objective is to promote tourism.

Harvey said: “There is a sense of momentum and excitement and everyone is learning from each other. I do not believe in PDOs by county, however. Many leading wineries source from a number of counties so any such designation is meaningless and confusing for the consumer.

“We should celebrate England and Wales and then the individual producers. Slicing and dicing beyond that is confusing enough for us here in the UK.”

Rebecca Fisher, marketing & events manager at Hattingley Valley, part of Vineyards of Hampshire, agrees it shouldn’t be about regional PDOs because “it is too early for anything like that”.

She added: “Vineyards of Hampshire is very much a marketing body to showcase quality products from producers with a similar ethos and values.”

Mike Wagstaff, owner & winemaker at Greyfriar Vineyard, part of a group called Vineyards of the Surrey Hills, said: “At this stage it doesn’t make sense to have regional quality distinctions because we are not sure consumers are interested in subtle distinctions yet. We should be promoting English and Welsh wine collectively rather than focusing on Surrey, Sussex or any other sub-region.

For some producers defining wines by county could be particularly challenging. Nyetimber, for example, has vineyards across Sussex, Hampshire and Kent.

Its head winemaker, Cherie Spriggs, said: “The quality of these vineyards is linked by several factors, with no one county being superior to others. After all, vines don’t know what political geography boundaries exist.

“We remain of the position that it is the quality of the individual sites and individual producer that is key. Indeed, we take full advantage of the subtle differences between the characteristics of each county where we have planted our vines.”

Jonathan White, head of marketing for Gusbourne Wine, another member of the Wine Garden of England, said: “In terms of separate wine regions, my view is that we need to ensure whatever actions we take are clear and of benefit to the consumer, in the UK and internationally.

“Current alignments seem to be focusing on geographical detail whereas aspects such as production methods are potentially of more benefit to the customer who is new to English sparkling wines and trying to establish quality associations with other well-known sparkling wine styles from around the world, such as Champagne, crémant, Prosecco, Franciacorta or cava.”

In 2016 a group of Sussex wineries applied for a “Sussex wine” PDO via the EU. Until the process is ratified, Sussex wine has temporary protected status in the UK, so all wines using the name “Sussex wine” have to be produced in the county from grapes grown there. The first wine to be produced under the Sussex PDO scheme was approved in 2016 for Rathfinny Estate.

The Co-op has pledged to experiment more with different wine formats in future after expanding its range of cans, 50cl bottles and minibottles.

Senior wine buyer Gyles Walker told DRN: “It’s an area we can do more with, but we are seeing some of our suppliers now come to us to offer those exclusives and those first-to-market opportunities.

“We will definitely be looking at different formats in wine for the future, and indeed across BWS as a whole.

“Our beer team is well ahead of the curve on that, but then they have had that opportunity in craft beer, which has driven that interest and real excitement with the customer. And in the wine team we are sharing that best practice from beer.

“Different formats is not an age thing for wine, it is about producing wine in different sized bottles and cans so we have the perfect products for dinner party, al fresco and other occasions. There are numerous opportunities for wine and drinks to get that format right to suit the occasion, and it is amazing to see that development in the trade over the past three or four years.”

The Co-op added a number of 50cl variants earlier this year and it has more planned for the summer. Last year it added wines to its 37.5cl collection, and it also has wine in cans and larger packs, such as bag-in-box

Walker said: “It’s too early to say how well the 50cl wines are doing, but we know there are definitely customers who want to buy that size to share.

“We know the pressures on inflation and we understand that some great wines are going outside some of our customers’ budgets, so 50cl is a great opportunity for us to keep customers interested in these great-quality wines.

“We know also there is a great understanding from customers in how much alcohol they are consuming and 50cl is therefore a good sharing-size wine for a couple.

“It allows us to be responsible and to get that across to the consumer. It also helps us link wine and good together, and to talk about those mid-week shopping occasions.”

One of the 50cl newcomers for the Co-op this summer is a Château du Rouët Provence Rosé at £8.50.Walker said: “We know that style of rosé commands a higher price from the quality of the production and we understand the affordability, so Ben Cahill on our wine team sourced this 50cl version.”

The Co-op is adding a number of Provence-style rosés for the summer, including a “world first” with its listing of Studio by Miraval, described by Simon Cairns, category trading manager for BWS, as “a real coup for us at Co-op and it could only happen when the supplier believes in what we are doing here”.

The retailer is also introducing a range of three alcohol-free wines in June.

Walker said: “No-alcohol is definitely a growth area. Hats off to the beer guys – they have seen that customer insight and the brands are obviously leading that in a very strong way. “It is amazing how winemakers have really managed to understand the technology to produce quality in low and no-alcohol. And I think that is an area that is just going to expand and carry on developing.”

The campaign “All in the Chase” is brought to life by a 70-second brand film, premium print advertising and other outdoor executions. The film depicts stages of the production process, showing potatoes growing and being harvested, fermented into a base spirits, distilled into Chase vodka and then how the vodka is then distilled with botanicals to make Chase’s range of signature gins.

William Chase is the company’s founder, and in 2008 he set up the business, which is described as “the first field to bottle distillery in the UK”.

Global brand ambassador, James Chase, said: “Last year we celebrated out tenth anniversary, in a very competitive market there are not a huge number of craft gins telling some interesting stories. We want premium gin consumers to understand our Chase ‘field to bottle’ story, so launching our first advertising campaign felt like the next natural step in our journey as a family business.”

Andrew Carter, managing director of the business, said: “Our Chase portfolio of brands is now available in over 40 markets worldwide and this campaign will be at the heart of our marketing plans to continue to drive the dynamic growth of our Chase gin and vodka premium spirits portfolio.”

Black Cow is reinforcing its sustainability message and the issue of food waste with its first flavour innovation.

Black Cow Vodka & English Stawberries uses locally-sourced strawberries that are either left over or too misshapen for sale in the UK grocers and farm shops. The seasonal edition has been produced in a limited run for the first 2019 production.

The newcomer is made using only strawberries to flavour the vodka, with no added sugar or sweeteners. The berries are pressed and infused in Black Cow Vodka for four days before being filtered and hand bottled at the distillery.

Founders Paul Archard and Jason Barber said: “Having always used leftover produce which would otherwise go to waste to create Black Cow Vodka, this strawberry variant enables us to reduce waste further while creating a delicious new flavour perfect for the summer.”

Black Cow Vodka was first launched by Paul Archard and dairy farmer Jason Barber in 2012 and it is the only vodka made entirely from whey from grass-grazed cow’s milk left over from the cheese-making process. This is fermented to convert the milk sugars into alcohol that is distilled, blended and filtered through coconut-shell charcoal, to produce an “exceptionally smooth” vodka with a unique creamy character.

Patrick Materman, chief winemaker for Brancott Estate, says the launch of the organic wines in the Living Land Series is a significant milestone that epitomises an ongoing commitment to environmental programmes.

He said: “Ever since we first planted Sauvignon Blanc in Marlborough more than 40 years ago, we’ve known our vineyards are our greatest resource. As a founding member of New Zealand’s original sustainable winegrowing initiative, we have strong views on developing and running environmental programmes and have always made a conscious effort to limit any impact on the environment.

“We’ve always had a special relationship with the land and this makes it easy to adopt practices that ensure the land is protected and enhanced for the future. With our Living Land Series, we celebrate the initiatives that we undertake to preserve the integrity of our vineyards and their environs.”

The UK wine industry is one of the country’s fastest growing agricultural sectors and three million vines have already been planted this year, which is nearly double that of 2018.

The record number of vines planted this year – equating to an additional 690 hectares of vineyards and a 24% increase in the overall land now under vine – also makes the UK one of the fastest expanding wine regions in the world.

The total of three million vines is nearly double that planted last year (1.6 million) and three times the one million vines planted in 2017.

Much of the planting is taking place in the counties of South East England (Kent, Sussex and Hampshire) but the spread of vines now also includes Gloucestershire, Northamptonshire, Devon, Somerset, Suffolk, Norfolk, Essex and Wales.

Simon Robinson, chairman of WineGB, said: “This impressive figure of three million vines represents another milestone in the growth of our fantastic industry. Last year we set out our vision that in the next 20 years, at the rate of current growth, we could be producing some 40 million bottles per year. We are certainly heading towards that. This is a thriving British industry.”

These growth figures come off the back of the UK’s most successful vintage last year, following the good summer weather and harvest of 2018, which yielded 15.6 million bottles, up from the annual average of 5.5 million bottles.

The news coincides with English Wine Week, which will see events and promotions across the country in vineyards, retailers, restaurants and pubs to promote an awareness in English and Welsh wines.

In 2016 the company kickstarted a major investment in its portfolio with the releaunch of Single Malt Scotch Whisky Tamnavulin in 2016, followed by the redeveloped positioning for Single Malt Scotch Whisky Jura, which launched five new whiskies for the domestic market in 2017.

The investment continued with the launch of the contemporary brand Shakleton in 2017 while 2018 saw the release of Woodsman Blended Scotch Whisky and Wildcat Gin.

This year it launched The Whisky Works, a boutique whisky house.

Rod Gillies, head of innovation at Whyte & Mackay, said: “We’ve doubled the size of our brand portfolio in the last three years, with new whiskies developed to bring new consumers into the category. Now, with Whyte & Mackay Light, we’re using the strength of one of our existing brands to deliver an attractive option for the growing number of consumers who may be looking to keep an eye on their alcohol intake.

""People trust Whyte & Mackay to make a great-tasting spirit and, thanks to our expert distilling team, Whyte & Mackay Light tastes fantastic – either straight over ice, or served with your favourite mixer. We think it’s a compelling addition to the spirit drink category, and we’re looking forward to introducing consumers and shoppers to it.”

Whyte & Mackay Light is available now from Tesco stores priced at £12.

The launch follows a number of lower alcohol spirit launches over the last six months, including the launch of the Infusions range from Smirnoff and the 30% abv Ketel One Botanical range.

The Breezer range is packaged in 25cl cans and each variant is 4% abv. The three initial flavours will be: Blood Orange & Ginger; Strawberry, Cucumber & Mint; and Lemon & Elderflower.

The new brand is being launched in partnership with the Tesco Group and it will be available from May 20 at Tesco retail stores, priced at £1.80 per can. Breezer will be available via wholesaler through Budgens & Londis from May 13 and Booker & Premier from May 27. It will be rolled out to all major UK retailers from November 2019.

The newcomer has been created to tap into the popular RTD sector, which is currently the fastest-growing category in the total UK alcohol market, according to Bacardi.

Amanda Almond, managing director – UK & Ireland, said: “As consumers become increasingly more conscious of their alcohol intake, we are seeing huge growth in the popularity of the lower-alcohol RTD sector. We hope that the introduction of Breezer will cater to people of all ages who are looking for new and exciting flavour combinations in a convenience, easy-to-drink format.”

The producer has other RTD options in its portfolio, including pre-mixed versions of its classic Bacardi Rum serves such as Bacardi & Cola, Bacardi Mojito and Bacardi Raspberry Spritz.

The Rioja brand, owned by Pernod Ricard, has added its first-ever rosé and unlike traditional Spanish rosé wines it has opted for the popular pale and dry Provence-style wine.

Chris Shead, off-trade channel director for Pernod Ricard UK said: “We are very excited for this launch as it opens up an already strong brand to a new audience. Campo Viejo is the biggest Spanish brand on the market, accounting for 15.8% of Spanish Wine sales and contributing £99m to the UK wine category. Not only that, but it is currently the UK’s favourite red wine, and so this incremental launch to the category provides consumers with something new from a much-loved household name. Its elegant packaging will create strong standout on shelf, much like the rest of the brand’s best-selling range.”

Chief winemaker, Elena Adell, said: “The colour of our new Campo Viejo Rose is a beautiful pale coral-pink, with a vibrant tone that reflects its finesse but also its vitality. It is this vitality that makes Campo Viejo Rose unique. It has perfumed aromas, intense flavours, a magnificent mouth feel and a long finish.”

The wine is described as having “lively flavours of cherry, citrus, strawberry and rose petals, balanced by gentle acidity”.

The wine will be priced £8 and is available exclusively from Morrisons from July 1.

Online drinks delivery retailer Drinkly is set to expand into eight new cities in 2019.

The company was set up at the end of 2016 by John Robertson, who wanted to recreate the success of US quick-delivery services in the UK market.

Drinkly was initially trialled in Edinburgh and in two years has accrued more than 3,000 regular customers. It was later extended into Glasgow and revenues are expected to reach £1 million this year.

The plan for 2019 is to explore opportunities for the business in London, Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, Liverpool, Newcastle, Birmingham and Aberdeen.

Robertson, who previously worked as the international sales manager for Innis & Gunn, told DRN: “My career has always been in the drinks industry and when I did a business course in the US I found myself talking to brands about quick delivery services in the drinks market there, and then I wondered if it could work in the UK. I tested the market in the leanest way possible but the good thing was we got customers and they came back, and then we got more.

“It has grown pretty solidly since we started and six months ago we raised some funds to invest further and employ a team of staff.

“We currently work with one retailer in Edinburgh. It was excited about us providing a delivery service because it didn’t have the time to manage its own website and it could see that our ability to drive an additional revenue stream – and especially something that could fight back against delivery services from Amazon – was also an attractive proposition.

“We work across a three-mile radius of Edinburgh city centre and we have managed to drive drinks sales by 30% for that retailer through our promise of delivering chilled drinks within one hour. Our operation in Glasgow is also growing extremely quickly and there we work with a retailer with four stores that again didn’t have any online proposition or ability to deliver.

“The minimum order is £20 and the basket spend on average is £36, which is three times the average retail purchase for the retailers we currently work with. Delivery costs £3.50 or it is free over £40.”

Drinkly is looking for retailers that have a good range of mainstream brands along with some smaller, niche brands to drive interest. Online shoppers have been seeking out well-known brands and gift options, such as a nice gin or whisky (a gift-wrap service is available from Drinkly) and there is also a market for people ordering drinks to go with a takeaway, Robertson said.

“We are looking for retailers with a good product mix, whether they are wine merchants or convenience stores,” he added. “Our Edinburgh retailer has 650 products available online, although I would say around 200 is ideal.

“We operate firmly within the law and our drivers are trained to reject an order if they choose to do so. Customers have to show ID to the driver to verify it is the person who ordered and that they are over 18.

“We are looking to expand across more cities and we are looking to identify those partners that we feel are the right fit for us, with the right licensing conditions and an interesting product mix.”

"Wine needs to boost its credentials as a refreshing beverage if it is to flourish going forward, according to Treasury Wine Estates.","12 April, 2019",http://cdn744.pressflex.net/images//18629.photo.2.jpg?m=1555061545,http://drinksretailingnews.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/18629/Treasury_Wine_Estates_bidding_to_make_wine_more_refreshing.html,"Wine needs to boost its credentials as a refreshing beverage if it is to flourish going forward, according to Treasury Wine Estates.

The company has launched Blossom Hill Gin Fizz in a bid to address this issue, while also hoping to lure consumers back from Prosecco and gin.

“It combines two categories that consumers are switching to from wine,” said Kirstie McCosh, the firm’s European marketing director.

She added: “Refreshment is key. It is the number one choice for what beverage people choose, so providing refreshing options within wine is critical to the long-term health of the category. When you ask consumers, particularly over the summer, what is the attribute they look for, beyond fruity or crisp or anything else, it’s refreshment.

“This need to be able to quench thirst is important for wine, because it’s a way for us to expand into new occasions, driving that development of the market so we become more relevant on more occasions.

“When you stack wine up against lots of other alcoholic beverages, it is seen as being less refreshing than other alcohol categories.”

“When you ask consumers about what parts of wine actually deliver refreshment, four in 10 say rosé. That’s why we launched Blossom Hill Pale Rosé. It was the number one rosé launch in 2018 and it is bringing incremental spend into the category.

“Fruit-flavoured wines and sparkling wines are doing well, but how do you make the rest of the category more relevant to consumers? One of our strategies is to modernise Blossom Hill and retain relevance going forward. We have used this insight as a way of unlocking opportunity, particularly around recruitment.”

"The off-trade cider category has enjoyed 5.3% value growth over the past year to reach £1.2 billion (IRI, year to February 2019).","12 April, 2019",http://cdn744.pressflex.net/images//18630.photo.2.jpg?m=1555061689,http://drinksretailingnews.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/18630/Westons_confident_of_premium_credentials.html,"The off-trade cider category has enjoyed 5.3% value growth over the past year to reach £1.2 billion (IRI, year to February 2019).

Westons has been one of the star performers with soaring consumer demand for its flagship 8.2% abv Henry Westons vintage cider driving its impressive growth.

So it was somewhat concerned to learn of new guidance from the Portman Group around single-serve packs.

The industry watchdog’s new code of practice states that “single-serve, non-resealable containers shouldn’t be more than four units” of alcohol so as to “establish a credible definition for assessing complaints about irresponsible sampling promotions or packaging”.

It adds that “mitigating factors for products up to six units, such as premium status, pricing and share message, may be taken into account”, but the beer industry is concerned about the impact this will have and cider stands to be penalised by the guidance.

Geoff Bradman, commercial director at Westons, told DRN: “We are seeking clarity from the Portman Group around its definition of premium. It is saying there are three criteria that if a product doesn’t satisfy it will fall foul: the bottle must be able to be shut; overt messaging around the packaging to say sharing; and that it must be premium, and our interpretation [of that] is demonstrably premium.

“What’s the definition of that? We’ve been in discussion with the Portman Group to get clarity on that. We are confident in the premium nature of our brand. The guidelines follow on from the minimum unit pricing thought process. They would be keen not to penalise crafted products. It’s early days, but it was a surprise.”

Bradman acknowledged that trading conditions are currently challenging amid a raft of consolidation among retailers and suppliers, a new duty band on ciders between 6.9% and 7.5% and a continual reduction in pub numbers.

But he is confident in Westons’ ability to maintain growth. “Our view is that our strategy means we are well placed to deal with the challenges in front of us in an incredibly competitive environment,” he said. “Our key watchword is relevance, and our entire focus is on making us relevant to consumers and the marketplace.”

Insight and innovation manager Matthew Langley added: “Cider has once again made a huge contribution to sales in the off-trade across all retail formats and we see no sign of this changing.

“Some 47.8% of all households now regularly buy cider – up from 45.5% last year – while the number of cider shoppers has also risen by 3.8%. Even more encouragingly, value has continued to outpace volume, which clearly signals how drinkers are continuing to trade up to more premium ciders. New research commissioned by Westons for this year’s cider report reveals that the breadth of cider drinkers also continues to widen.

“All these factors are clearly good news for the category’s long-term prospects.

“Apple is still dominant, accounting for more than half of all cider sales and up 2.5% by value year on year. But fruit has had another fantastic year with sales up 11.7% in value to help it secure £1 of every £3 spent in the off-trade.

“In last year’s report we predicted that fruit cider would account for half of all ciders sold by 2023. But we estimate that this is now likely to happen a year earlier than our original prediction.”

Borough Wines is embarking on a franchise scheme for its retail estate as the business continues to ramp up its focus on wholesale.,"12 April, 2019",http://cdn744.pressflex.net/images//18631.photo.2.jpg?m=1555061818,http://drinksretailingnews.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/18631/Borough_Wines_embarks_upon_franchise_scheme.html,"Borough Wines is embarking on a franchise scheme for its retail estate as the business continues to ramp up its focus on wholesale.

It will retain 100% ownership of its original store in London’s Borough Market, but the other nine stores in the estate could transfer to a new ownership model.

The scheme would see 60% of a store owned by independent store managers and 40% by Borough Wines. Three stores have already been converted to the new franchise system while others are in the transition process.

Founder Muriel Chatel told DRN: “I didn’t really want to buy from our competitors as this was not my business model, but the store managers are more empowered this way and they can buy elsewhere.”

Last year Borough Wines announced it was focusing more on wholesale in a bid to become a leading supplier of wines on tap.

Chatel said the two post-Brexit referendum stores it opened in 2017 – in Chiswick and Battersea Park – have underperformed.

The Battersea Park store closed at the end of December, but Chatel said she is in talks with a potential franchisee for this shop.

She said: “It is a very challenging market and those stores were not working as they should have done. For us it is more about evolving and we are now moving our warehouse so that we can concentrate on the kegging and wholesale areas of the business. For us it is a lot safer to focus on wholesale.”

Wine on tap is a key focus of its wholesale business and Chatel launched a bottle refill system for shoppers at the initial stall in 2002.

The business now shares this expertise with operators in the on-trade. It sources wines from around the world, ships them to its warehouse then puts them into kegs for distribution. When these are empty it can collect them from customers to refill them.

Its keg portfolio currently comprises 24 wines and it has house wines along with a premium tier.

Minimum unit pricing has delivered a hammer blow to white cider in Scotland as sales have fallen off a cliff since it was introduced on May...,"12 April, 2019",http://cdn744.pressflex.net/images/18632.photo.2.jpg?m=1555062394,http://drinksretailingnews.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/18632/Minimum_unit_pricing_yields_clear_winners_and_losers_in_Scotland.html,"Minimum unit pricing has delivered a hammer blow to white cider in Scotland as sales have fallen off a cliff since it was introduced on May 1, 2018.

IRI data for the 40 subsequent weeks to February 2019 shows value white cider down 73.3% and value amber cider down 54% year on year.

Own-label products have also collapsed amid a drastic shift in the market, but there are several big winners too.

In the 12 weeks to February, ale sales rose 8.3% in volume and 15.2% in value in Scotland, compared to growth of 1% and 2.3% respectively in the rest of the UK.

Premium cider is also enjoying 9.4% growth and craft cider is up 22% in Scotland, while mainstream brands such as Strongbow and Magners are growing, along with world beer and mainstream lager.

Buckfast sales are surging as the tonic wine did not suffer any price rises, while it is interesting to note that K cider at 8% abv and Scrumpy Jack at 6% abv have also benefited from increased sales as Scottish shoppers look for alternatives to the high-strength ciders they had previously been drinking.

Wales is poised to introduce a 50p MUP this year and England could follow suit, so producers and retailers are watching developments in Scotland closely.

Darryl Hinksman, head of business development at Westons, said: “Value white cider is effectively dead. MUP has premiumised the category and taken units out of the Scottish cider market. It is killing off this bottom end. We think it’s a good thing.”

In the 12 weeks to February, total beer and cider volume was down 3.2% in Scotland, while volume sales were up 1.3% in the rest of the UK. However, value sales have risen by 11.3% in Scotland, versus 3.2% in the rest of the UK. That is because the average price per litre has risen 56p in Scotland.

Mumtaz Ali, owner of Mace convenience store in Edinburgh, told DRN: “My sales are up 20% since MUP was introduced in Scotland. I am now seeing good sales of multipacks of beer and cider, so eight, 10 and 12-packs and some bigger ones. We can now sell these at the same price as a supermarket can and we get a good margin on them too. I will definitely add more of those in the near future.

“Before MUP I was a bit too frightened to stock those, when I had them at £11 a pack and supermarkets had them at £8. I am sure the independent sector for alcohol is up in general since MUP. It’s very encouraging. Even in spirits I can now sell the cheapest vodka in my store at the same price as you would find in a supermarket. It doesn’t seem to have put people off buying alcohol but I don’t think there has been a negative effect either. It gives us a better margin.”

DRN columnist Gemma Cooper, commercial business partner at Nielsen, reports that total BWS volume sales are flat in Scotland, while value sales have grown 8% since MUP was introduced.

That suggests MUP is not achieving its actual aim – to reduce alcohol consumption in Scotland – and instead is simply skewering the market in different directions.

“Scottish shoppers are becoming increasingly savvy when it comes to buying alcohol, shifting their spend to more premium products or indeed mixing up their current repertoire,” said Cooper. “Around one in five shoppers claim to have bought more premium brands as they believed them to be more affordable when compared to cheaper brands.”

Ali added: “It doesn’t seem to have put people off buying alcohol but I don’t think there has been a negative effect either. It gives us a better margin. I would say shoppers were quick to realise the prices would be the same everywhere and that has driven them into the convenience sector. They don’t want to queue for ages in a supermarket, they just want to buy something quickly.”

Another DRN columnist, industry commentator Paul Chase, called MUP a bad idea that is proliferating like a virus and highlighted that volume sales actually grew 3.8% in Scotland last summer after MUP was introduced (IRI, April 20-October 13).

“It’s worth remembering the predictions made by researchers at Sheffield University – whose modelling underpins the political support for this policy – that unit consumption per head would fall by 3.5%, and by 7% for harmful drinkers,” he said. “The only argument MUP’s supporters make in response is that while sales and consumption may have risen in Scotland, they’re not rising as much as in England where we don’t have MUP. But then, consumption in Scotland was at a higher level to start with. In my view if the only way you can score goals is by moving the goalposts you’re in the wrong game.”

He also laughed off suggestions that last summer’s sales were up because Scottish drinkers were keen to cheer on England in the World Cup.

“But a big change in regulation creates new winners and losers,” he added. “The big loser is own-label. This has collapsed in every category or been withdrawn as it now has no place in the pricing hierarchies.

“Many of these were lower-strength products bought by low-income consumers – which demonstrates the regressiveness of this pricing reform. It always was about pricing alcohol out of reach of the poor even though the locus of alcohol abuse is among the moneyed middle classes.

“In the short term supermarkets have lost volume sales and c-stores have picked them up as the price differential narrows. I don’t expect to see this continue because supermarkets will find a way of fighting back.”

Staff at embattled retailer Oddbins have been tweeting excitedly after receiving deliveries of wine over the past week.

The chain was plunged into administration earlier this year, along with sister companies Whittalls Wines Merchants and Wine Cellar Trading.

European Food Brokers, which owns all three retailers, said Brexit and the resulting economic uncertainty, along with poor high street sales over the Christmas period, were to blame for the situation.

Hundreds of workers face uncertainty over their future employment prospects, but they were pleased to share news that wine had arrived in the past week.

Twitter is full of Oddbins staff posing joyously, defiantly even, next to cases that have arrived at their stores.

“Delivery in the house! Our shelves are once again full with delicious wine,” said the team at the Oddbins store in Shawlands, Glasgow.

The Elm Row, Edinburgh, team tweeted: “We’ve just got some WINE delivered today! Form an orderly queue at the doors.”

Oddbins Maida Vale, London, told customers: “A big white truck brought us and you more wine. Life is better...” It added: “Apparently when the fat lady sings... she ain’t singing yet... so until the cows come home or whatever... Still here!”

“Delivery day! Some old favourites back in stock, and a couple of tasty new things too!” tweeted Oddbins in Aberdeen.

Oddbins Queensferry even went with the hashtag #wearenotdeadyet as it posed happily with a delivery.

The Edinburgh-based ‘on demand’ drinks delivery service, which started in 2016, is ready to extend into West London. This will be the first of eight city launches planned for 2019.

The company has now taken on Glen Stocco as its new Director of Business Operations and Jill Davidson as its Brand Partnerships Manager.

Stocco moves across from his role as an advisor and mentor for Scottish companies, exploring foreign markets and an assessor for Scottish Edge. He also has experience in the drinks trade, having held the role of President for a growing craft cider company in Canada. In his Drinkly role he will focus on structuring the company for growth, overseeing legal and technical developments, as well as leading on strategy, financial planning and forecasting.

John Robertson, founder and chief executive of Drinkly, said: “Glen is an operational leader with a proven track record working with founders and chief executives, driving business transformation and growth while also ensuring robust processes, systems and governance. He has a good knowledge of a broad range of functions including finance, HR, legal, operations and sales, and brings a track record of stakeholder management and negotiation across multiple sectors.”

The UK’s Swedish whisky market is about to get a new player with the news that Fields, Morris & Verdin (FMV) is to add High Coast to its spirits portfolio.

High Coast is one of a handful of Swedish distilleries to be founded in recent years and it is also one of the world’s most northerly distilleries.

The company was rebranded in 2018 to be named after its location in Adalen on the High Coast of north-eastern Sweden. The distillery is located on the banks of the Angermanalven River in a building that once housed the power plant for a wooden box factory, where the distillery’s initial name ‘Box’ originated.

Spirits buyer, Doug McIvor, said: “I have been following the emergence of High Coast over the past few years after tasting new make spirit from the distillery a while back. My thoughts on tasting the spirit back then were that this was a world-beating whisky for the future. Everything I have tasted from High Coast since then has confirmed this to be true.”

Spirits director, Johnny Roberts, said: “We are thrilled to be working with the team from High Coast. At 63degrees North it is one of the world’s most northerly distilleries; amazingly the Arctic circle passes through their maturing whisky! High Coast is a fantastic whisky that complements our existing range from Berry Bros. & Rudd, Glenrothes and Daftmill.”

The Greek wine producer started out as a project inspired by estate owner Alexandre Avatangelos and Gerard Margeon, the head sommelier of the Alain Ducasse Group, and T-OINOS wines are the first in 3000 years to be produced from the volcanic soil of Tinos, a World Heritage-listed island of the Cyclades. The company has a reputation for producing some of the top white wines in the world, according to Berkmann.

The winegrower, Stephane Derenoncourt, is a world-renowned consultant who has worked with clients in Bordeaux and around the world, including Domaine de Chevalier, Clos Fourtet, Clos de l’Oratoire and Smith Haut-Lafitte.

Oenologist and associate winemaker, Thanos Georgilas, was part of the viticulture and oenology research team at Opus One in California and the production and viticulture team at Chateau Latour, Pauillac in Bordeaux.

Berkmann’s director of fine wine and private clients, Guillem Kerambrun, said: “As a sommelier, I had the opportunity to taste and present the wonderful wines of T-OINOS in many restaurants around the world since its first vintage. It is a pleasure for me to welcome T-OINOS to the Berkmann Wine Cellars portfolio.

The Somerset producer said cider is outperforming other alcohol categories and is showing the most room for future growth.

In the off-trade value is growing ahead of volume (5.5% and 2.6% respectively), showing that premiumisation is an important aspect of the category.

Alicia Petchley, insights manager, said: “Cider still has a clear opportunity to drive growth. Looking at beer, in that category there’s around five million additional shoppers over cider. As a sector we have the most room to grow and scope to introduce more shoppers into the category.

“As the category gains traction outside of its traditional South West heartland we have seen people move towards different taste profiles for cider. Fruit ciders have helped fill this demand, but it is important to remember that there’s an important role for the taste diversity that apple ciders can deliver through innovative cidermaking, from dry through to medium and sweet.”

The company said two of its brands – Thatchers Gold and Thatchers Haze - are already driving market growth, particularly in draught format. In the off-trade Thacthers is showing double-digit volume and value growth across all regions. Thatchers Gold is the number two canned apple cider in value terms and Haze is the number one cloudy cider.

Also this year, the producer is introducing Thatchers Rose, made from rosy-red dessert apples to produce a pink cider with no additional added fruit flavours.

It also plans to introduce a new media campaign in 2019 for Thatchers Haze, as well as tripling the number of events it will be attending this year, as part of its investment in the growth of the cider category. Haze will be on TV with two new adverts for the first time while the overall company will be represented at cricket matches this year as a result of its Official Cider status at the ICC Cricket World Cup.

Thatchers also plans to plant 13 acres of new orchard this year – more than 5,000 new trees – taking its total to more than 500 acres.

As part of this the producer is also establishing its 100 Tree Trial, which is a trial of more than 40 acres of apples trees made up of varieties that haven’t been used in its cidermaking before.

The company said: “These are varieties that have either done well in the Exhibition Orchard or have a reputation for producing excellent cider. We will be monitoring how well they grow.”

Thatchers’ Exhibition Orchard is home to 458 different varieties of apple. All 458 varieties have been blended into its Cider Barn 458 cider.

“Not sure what’s funnier, this Tweet or that Carlsberg UK are promoting it,” one commenter chimed in.

It is certainly another attention-grabbing marketing plan from the Danish brewer’s UK team, which recently ditched the classic Carlsberg SKU and replaced it with a new beer called Carlsberg Pilsner.

The new brew is also 3.8% abv, but it has been totally reformulated “from head to hop” in a bid to deliver a smoother fuller mouth-feel and a better taste.

The packaging has also changed in a further effort to cut ties with its predecessor, and now the brewer is gleefully poking fun at the old brew.

“Carlsberg tastes like stale breadsticks,” reads another Tweet, with “Promoted by Carlsberg UK” emblazoned underneath.

Carlsberg always carried the slogan: “Probably the best beer in the world”. But now it has held its hands up and admitted it was probably not the best beer in the world.

Instead it is promoting “probably the meanest Tweets in the world” to draw attention to its decision to change the recipe and ingredients, and encourage consumers to try the new brew.

“Drinker’s interest in mainstream lager has waned because, though the world has moved on, the mainstream category hasn’t,” said Liam Newton, vicep president of marketing at Carlsberg UK, which has enjoyed strong success with Brooklyn, San Miguel and London Fields in the UK off-trade over the past couple of years. “At Carlsberg UK, we lost our way. We focused on brewing quantity, not quality; we became one of the cheapest, not the best. In order to live up to our promise of being ‘probably the best beer in the world’, we had to create a better beer.

“We’ve completely rebrewed Carlsberg from head to hop and created Carlsberg Danish Pilsner with a crisper, fuller flavour. We will be offering the people that posted mean tweets about our old brew a taste of our new pilsner to see if they agree.”

A £20 million ad campaign went live this week to invert the brand’s “probably” slogan across TV, social media and billboards, and it expects to reach 97% of the British population.

New Zealand Winegrowers, Loire Valley and Centre Loire Wines joined forces for a joint celebration of the myriad wonders of Sauvignon Blanc today.

The London tasting marked the first time that the world’s two most famous Sauvignon Blanc producing regions have collaborated in the UK market.

The idea was spawned when Chris Stroud from New Zealand Winegrowers and Victoria Kukla from Sopexa, which represents the Loire generics, were drinking copious amounts of Sauvignon at the International Wine Challenge dinner.

Jamie Goode and Rebecca Gibb MW made the case for the regions at the tasting and the organisers were pleased with the turnout.

Kukla told DRN: “New Zealand and the Loire are always pitted against each other when it comes to Sauvignon Blanc. People have preconceptions about both regions, but Sauvignon Blanc has evolved so much and there’s so much talent working in New Zealand and going over to the Loire, and vice versa and we just felt that with this tasting we wanted to challenge all the preconceptions that people had.”

In blind tastings, several MWs and leading wine experts mistook New Zealand Sauvigons for Loire wines and vice versa.

“We wanted to show that there are exciting things going on with the same grape on opposite sides of the world,” added Kukla. “It has come out really positively, showing the distinction rather than pitting them against each other, because we’re all one big wine world.

“A lot of the producers from the Loire have been going to other regions. Henri Bourgeois has created some great Sancerre, but also some great Marlborough. It’s interesting to see the differences, and that people are collaborating.

“It really frustrates me that people talk about Old World and New World. It’s one wine world, because realistically nowadays a lot of them are going to work in different wine regions and sharing techniques.

“You are seeing it across the board in France, not just in the Loire. You’re seeing it in Beaujolais, in Chablis. In Burgundy they now have an internship where young winemakers go out to Central Otago.

“It’s interesting to see how they’re swapping talent. It’s very progressive.”

Diageo is introducing Smirnoff Infusions, creating a range for the Smirnoff portfolio that is designed to be mixed with soda to create a lower calorie finished serve.

The new spirit drink, which is made with Smirnoff No 21 Vodka, is infused with real fruit essence and natural ingredients to produce two variants: Smirnoff Infusions Orange, Grapefruit & Bitters; and Smirnoff Infusions Raspberry, Rhubarb & Vanilla.

Each variant is 23% abv and is designed to be mixed with soda. This leads to a finished serve containing 87 calories, based on a 50cl serve of Smirnoff Infusions.

Sarah Shimmons, Smirnoff marketing manager for Europe, said: “Smirnoff Infusions is an exciting new addition to our portfolio in Great Britain, and looks to tap into the growing demand from consumers for great tasting drinks with a real depth of flavour.

“The process sees real fruits infused and distilled individually for the perfect amount of time to allow their natural flavours to be extracted. The resulting spirit drink is blended with Smirnoff No. 21 Vodka and crafted at 23% abv to ensure the perfect balance of natural and fruity flavours at the heart of the liquid with a good spirit cut-through.”

The launch will be supported by a £4.4 million campaign for its first year in market.

Diageo is working with a flavour house in Italy’s Piedmont hills area, with the aim of focusing on a raft of concepts and trends starting with the launch of a “very accessible gin”.

The drinks company will work with the flavour house team and local farmers to explore new botanicals and flavour ideas for NPD in drinks for the future.

The news was announced as part of Diageo GB’s launch of The Diageo Drinks Report, within which it identified a £5.2 billion opportunity for alcohol over the next three years.

In the report, which is designed to offer insight and guidance for retailers to help them drive sales and value in alcohol, Diageo GB identified a 12% growth opportunity (equating to £5.2 billion) for alcoholic beverages via four key growth pillars.

The four pillars as identified by the report include: Balanced Choices, which reflects the rise of mindful consumption and no and low alcohol; Make the Moment; which covers the idea of consumers looking for products that elevate their experiences; Exploration; reflected in the rise of craft products and discovering new things; and finally Celebration; which Diageo said represents the “huge opportunity for increased consumer spend” around the celebration and gifting occasion.

The report kicks of a new category initiative called Transforming Drinks Experiences, which aims to help retailers decipher these consumer trends and unlock the £5.2 billion growth opportunity in alcohol.

Madeline Bedford, senior customer category manager, said: “Consumer drinking habits are changing, with an increased focus on premiumisation and heritage. As consumers grow more confident and their repertoires become broader, it is no longer appropriate to look at drink categories in isolation. To unlock true value, we must identify where and how consumer want to enjoy drinks and ensure there is always a relevant offer for them.

“Our Transforming Drinks Experiences initiative identifies ways retailers can take advantage of shifts in consumer behaviours and maximise profits from the total alcoholic drinks category.” The campaign will be brought to live through a series of initiatives across print and online channels.

Diageo also promised a raft of innovation for 2019 and beyond, with NPD sitting under at least one of the four pillars.

Adam Miller, senior innovation manager, said the company will look at innovation for its key brands, such as Smirnoff and Tanqueray, but it would also be looking at launching ""new-to-market"" brands to tap into the growth opportunity in alcohol.

He also highlighted recent NPD, which he said already taps into the four areas of growth as identified in the latest Diageo Drinks Report.

He said: “We introduced new RTDs under the Gordon’s brand as Gordon's Ultra Low G&T flavoured drinks and also Smirnoff Infusions, which sit under the Balanced Choices pillar and then Gordon’s Pink, which is doing very well for us and sits under the Make the Moment pillar. Under Exploration we introduced brands such as Hop House 13 Lager, and then as part of the Celebrations pillar there are products such as Tanqueray Sevilla. An RTD version of this is about to go into the off-trade now in glass bottles.”

Last month Majestic announced plans to shut an undisclosed number of stores in a sweeping revamp of its business.

The company will rebrand as Naked Wines plc to reflect a growing focus on online sales going forward.

Rumours that the entire Majestic Wine retail estate will be sold as a going concern may prove unfounded as it unveiled the Naked Wines store on LinkedIn.

“Exciting to see the facelift underway at Majestic Wine Wakefield,” said store manager Andrij Jurkiw. “Now our first Naked Wines retail store. Over the next few weeks you’ll be able to taste some of the new wines in stores. Three great new services for customers are launching today too. Come for a chat about the changes over a glass of wine with us.”

The group, which purchased Naked Wines in a £70 million deal back in 2015 and installed founder Rowan Gormley as chief executive, said that this is the only trial store to be rebranded as Naked and it will monitor developments before making a full decision about the retail estate.

It is set to announce its latest financial results in June and it pledged to provide more details then about how many stores it will shut.

Uncertainty exists among some staff and they are looking forward to gaining clarity about their futures.

“I am glad that I decided to leave the company,” said former store manager Dominic Webb, who left before the announcement about store closures. “The minimal job security and lack of communication from people above me about what is going to happen next being the main reasons why I have left. Not having a job to move onto is both a scary and exciting challenge. Whatever the future brings I’m looking forward to it.”

Majestic’s share price stood at 270.5p prior to the announcement and it decreased 11.1% to 241.5p by 10am on the Monday the news broke. It has since recovered somewhat and opened at 250p today.

The Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA's) decision to block the merger of Sainsbury’s and Asda is short-sighted, according to a supply chain and logistics expert.

John Perry, managing director of Scala, a provider of management services for the supply chain and logistics sector, said: “The big four have been losing market share to the discounters for some time now, and on top of this have the added pressure of global retail giant Amazon entering the grocery sector.

“It therefore seems rather short-sighted that the CMA has blocked the proposed Sainsbury’s/Asda merger over fears it would reduce competition and therefore raise prices for consumers.

“With competition so rife in this constantly changing sector, it is actually quite unlikely that this merger would have had any significant impact on the consumer.

“Meanwhile, if Amazon eventually achieves the online dominance in grocery that is has achieved elsewhere, it is quite possible that in years to come we will look back in dismay at the decline of UK grocery retailers.”

Perry added that the merger would have given the two grocery retailers the opportunity to “become more efficient and compete as effectively as possible.”

He said: “They could have optimised their network of distribution centres and transport operations, with potentially significant gains through reduced handling and vehicle miles. Stock levels could also have been reduced, reducing warehousing space and capital that is currently tied up in inventory.

“Suppliers could have delivered larger orders into fewer distribution centres, which in turn would have increased consolidation, allowing vehicles to be utilised more efficiently and ultimately reducing vehicle mileage and the associated costs.

“With so much potential for efficiency gains, cost reductions and environmental rewards, all of which ultimately benefit the consumer, the CMA’s decision would suggest that it has fundamentally misunderstood the impact this merger would have had on competition.”

The CMA released a statement this morning which said it had decided to block the merger, stating that consumers would be worse off if the two were to merge.

More flavoured rums have hit the market, while Rhum Agricole producers are also expecting growth in the UK as interest in this French-style of rum gathers pace.

Nelson’s Distillery & School, which started in 2016, is introducing Nelson’s Signature Rum and Nelson’s Roasted Pineapple Rum.

The new rum is a blend of three rums from Barbados, The Dominican Republic and Jamaica; it is aged in oak barrels for three years before flavours such as the pineapple are added.

Neil Harrison, founder and master distiller, said: “We know that rum is the next big trend here in the UK, especially flavoured rum. As a forward-thinking proactive business, we wanted to ensure that our expansion not only incudes the development of our signature gin range, but also places us firmly at the forefront of this exciting new marketplace.”

Another flavoured rum to hit the scene this month is Hoxton Banana Rum from UK producer Hoxton Spirits. The rum is the first in a collection of spirits it plans to launch that will sit outside of the gin category. It is made from fresh and dried banana, which is then macerated for five weeks in hand-selected Caribbean rums.

Meanwhile Copalli Rum is heading over from Belize to tap into the growing popularity of French-style Rhum Agricole rums in the UK.

The premium, organic, single-estate rum has been distilled, barrelled, aged and bottled in the heart of the Belizean rainforest, according to producer, Copal Tree Distillery.

Two variants will be available in the UK via Masters of Malt: Copalli White Rum and Copalli Barrel Rested Rum, which is aged in American oak ex-bourbon barrels.

The White Rum (£33.50) is made from fresh sugar cane, which the producer said is crushed within two hours of being cut. The rum is made with a blend of pot and column distillation and with a long resting of the finished product on stainless steel.

The Barrel Rested Rum (rsp: £41.30) is made using double distillation of sugar cane juice, and exclusively full-bodied copper pot still distillation with French technique. The rum is described as being rich and sweet with cola and leather notes on the nose and tasting notes including cinnamon, nutmeg and tobacco.

The rums have already secured on-trade listings, including one with Laki Kane.

The bar’s creative director, Georgi Radev, said: “Copalli Rum is a truly organic rum made in the middle of the Belizean rainforest using fresh sugar cane juice and this really shows in the aroma and taste. When you open the bottle, the fresh cane aroma coming from it is just mesmerising.

“The taste is very delicate for Agricole rum, you taste the fresh sugar cane, with floral, fresh and fruity notes. This is absolutely perfect for a Daiquiri and a Mojito. It is amazing for fruity tropical drinks, but you can also use it in classy cocktails like a Negroni and Martini.”

Separately, Neptune Rum, which launched in the UK last year, has announced a series of appointments to form a new executive management team, in order to drive its growth strategy.

Gary Squire, who was previously sales director at Bacardi Martini, has joined as the company’s chief executive, while Lloyd White has joined as Director of Sales.

The Staffordshire-based Nelson's Distillery & School has also expanded its team with two new account managers, to help grow UK sales for its spirits.

Tamesis is a single vineyard still wine made from Bacchus grapes from Forty Hall Vineyard in Enfield, North London.

The wine is one of three releases this spring from Blackbook Winery, which produced its first wines in 2017. Tamesis will be joined by ‘I’d Rather be a Rebel” 2018 rose (made using 100% Pinot Noir grapes from Crouch Valley Vineyard in Essex) and ‘The Mix-Up’, which is the winery’s 2018 50-50 Bacchus-Ortega blend, made using grapes from Redhill Farm Estate in Kent.

Co-founder and winemaker, Sergio Verrillo, said: “At Blackbook we are proud of our London heritage and passionate about the city. We strive to demonstrate that world class wine can be produced in an urban winery and believe that our new Tamesis wine is a perfect example. Forty Hall Vineyard is the only commercial-scale vineyard in London and is run as a social enterprise engaging a committed set of enthusiastic volunteers.

""It is certified organic, avoiding the use of synthetic fungicides, herbicides or fertilizers to encourage sustainability, biodiversity and natural balance. I am a winemaker who likes to follow a traditional winemaking approach with low sulphur wines and indigenous elements, seeking to preserve the varietal characters in its wines.”

Blackbook’s 2018 vintage of approximately 17,000 bottles has more than tripled from the 5,500 in 2017, and it has extended the range from four to eight wines, using grapes sourced from seven vineyards, all within two hours of London.

The Battersea-based winery holds weekly winery experiences and tasting sessions as well as special events throughout the year, led by Verrillo. It also has an exclusive wine club, The Black Book, which offers members first access to the new releases as well as exclusive events at the winery throughout the year, including a post-harvest barrel tasting at the winery.

The lightly sparkling Bacchus Frizzante 2018 comes in a clear bottle with a screwcap and image of Brighton’s iconic West Pier, complete with a murmuration of starlings drawn by a tattoo artist. The label design is a nod to the spritz of the wine and the winery’s location behind the South Downs, ten minutes away from the coastal city.

Vineyard owner, Alison Nightingale, said: “The [Bacchus] grape has a natural exuberance and a lightness of touch.

“The Frizzante’s delicate effervescence complements the elegance and crispness of the wine, intensifying its flavours and creating a soft almost creamy mouthfeel.”

The 12.5% abv Bacchus Frizzante has a more youthful and fresh nature than the estate’s bottle fermented sparkling wines. It is made using the tank fermentation method, which is often used for more aromatic grapes and is the same process used to make Prosecco, resulting in a fruit-driven wine.

The Frizzante has a lighter fizz, which is around one third of that achieved in the estate’s sparkling wines, because only a small amount of sugar was added on second fermentation. This has created softer and more subtle bubbles, which can be bottled with a screwcap.

Nightingale added: “We are excited to be introducing Bacchus Frizzante for the summer, as a delightfully new and fun way to enjoy our ever-popular award-winning Bacchus wine.

“It is very drinkable because of its lightness, and would appeal to people who like Prosecco.”

The Frizzante is the second Italian-influenced product created by Nightingale and her Sicilian wine consultant Salvatore Leone. Last year the pair developed the first Sussex vermouth called 40.

“We are always trying to push the frontier and to introduce different things. With the Frizzante we are showing that we are adventurous and that we change our plans to respond to the opportunities that the climate presents to take English wine into new areas.

“The ideal growing conditions, with no frost while the vines flowered, a warm summer and dry September, created an opportunity to be more experimental with our Bacchus and more selective with our grapes.

“We believe we have created the perfect wine to enjoy during what we hope will be another glorious English summer.”

Just 3,500 bottles of the limited edition 2018 vintage have been produced and bottles will be priced at £14.95 from the producer’s website and from selected independent retailers.

The wine industry should learn from the “extraordinary innovation and growth” in beer and spirits, according to the managing director of Chapel Down, Mark Harvey.

He said: “We are not bound by 350 years of red tape in the wine industry in this country. We should learn from the extraordinary innovation and growth of the spirits and beer industries. So long as we deliver on mouth-wateringly delicious drinks and enhance the premium positioning of the Chapel Down brand then our history of leadership and innovation is set to continue.”

Chapel Down claims innovation is one of its “central philosophies” with recent moves including its extension into premium spirits last year with the launch of two gins and a vodka, all made from the grape skins of the previous year’s harvest.

Harvey’s statement coincided with the news that Chapel Down has commenced planting on its new 388-acre site, which the producer said boasts “the very finest terroir in the country”.

The Boarley Farm site, which was acquired last year, together with the producer’s Kit’s Coty and Boxley sites, will form a 620 acre estate of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier plantings on the North Downs of Kent.

Harvey added: “This is a really exciting development. Demand for our traditional method sparkling wine is sky high and these plantings enable us to really accelerate sales in the years to come. And with wines of great quality too – we know this from the overwhelmingly positive reaction to the Kit’s Coty collection from the same estate.”

The company also recently announced its traditional method wines would move to ebony glass, in order to offer the best protection in bottle.

Josh Donaghay-Spire, winemaker, said: “The move to dark amber glass on our sparkling wine is the result of an internal five-year project into the impact of UV light on wine. We spend a huge amount of energy producing the fruit right in the vineyards and then years to make and mature the wine so it makes sense to remove any potential risk of this quality being eroded due to glass colour.”

Brighton Gin has launched a Navy Strength variant as consumers continue to seek out new styles and tastes in gin.

The small batch Seaside Strength Navy Gin is the result of 12 months of recipe development and process refinement from the producer.

The variant has four times the amount of juniper and double the amount of fresh orange and lime peel than the original Brighton Gin.

Founder and managing director, Kathy Caton, said: “Our new Seaside Strength Gin is big, bold and a real gin-lover’s gin. With the alcohol at 57% ABV it can hold so much flavour. We have used our classic original Brighton Gin botanicals but riffed with the recipe and the process to create a fantastic sipping gin that also makes a world-class gin and tonic.

""It’s Brighton Gin turned up to 11 and we are delighted to see the reaction from our customers. It is amazing simply over ice with a wheel or lime or opened up with a splash of tonic or soda. It is a bracing walk beside the beach or a glass of cheer at the end of the Pier.

“Juniper is the star attraction but there is a cascade of zesty citrus on the nose with hints of candied orange, a whisper of pine and spice too. It is rich and creamy and deliciously satisfying when swallowed with no hint of burn. The waves of citrus finish go on forever, backed by an exhilarating underlying seaside freshness.”

The newcomer is available in 70cl and 35cl bottles and is said to be best served neat over ice or half and half with tonic and a wheel of lime. Bottles are priced at £47 for 70cl.

Love Drinks’s recently appointed managing director, Samantha Burke, said: “As the gin boom continues, it is great to see more and more consumers experimenting and discovering styles of gin and serves. For gin enthusiasts, this new Seaside Strength Navy Gin is a beauty – jumping with juniper and zesty citrus but retaining a silky smoothness.”

C&C’s minority stake in Jubel Beer will help reaffirm the start-up company’s mission to pioneer a new style of beer, according to co-founder Jesse Wilson.

Speaking to DRN Wilson said: “Jubel is leading the way in the infused beer category. It is positioned neatly between cider and beer because it offers the refreshment you get with fruit cider but with the drinkability of beer. Cider is refreshing but some people think it is too sweet while lager can sometimes be seen as a bit bland. We are in that unique middle ground of sessionable refreshment with a 4% abv product.”

Earlier this month the producer announced it had secured a minority stake investment from C&C, the drinks company behind Magners, Tennents and Orchard Pig. The investment will help drive distribution in the UK and Ireland through C&C’s routes to market, which includes Matthew Clark, Bibendum and Gleeson.

Wilson said: “We wanted funding for brand initiatives, dealing with increased demand and money to grow the team. A lot of craft brands are running to crowdfunding but when we looked at all the investment options this seemed like a natural fit and a good strategic partnership.

“We have grown really quickly and we needed support with our increased levels of distribution and being able to make enough beer to supply the demand.

“Off-trade growth has been really encouraging lately. Sainsbury’s became our biggest off-trade listing last November when it listed the brand in 600 stores and then this month they told us they would like to more than double this and so they have just added another 700 stores.

“Sainsbury’s and C&C’s support shows that they have both really seen the category opportunity for a brand like ours and they can see we are really pioneering a new space.""

Wilson highlighted the fact there are ""a lot of barriers to beer"" but he said the company's vision is to get a beer in every hand.

He said: ""Ours is a naturally infused style, which is vegan and gluten-free. We are removing those barriers to beer.”

Jubel has a new beer which it is currently trialling and which it will launch this summer.

Wilson said the new “laid-back lager” is potentially the producer's ""best beer yet”.

The current range includes Jubel Alpine, which is a peach-infused beer, and Jubel Urban, which is infused with elderflower.",Jubel Beer's mission to pioneer a new style looks set to accelerate

The wines will initially be available in Asda and Morrisons and will feature three varietals: Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and a sparkling blend of Pinot Noir and Muscat.

Kirstie McCosh, European Marketing Director at Treasury Wine Estates, said: “Low and no alcohol is a category in growth and with teetollallers now making up 21% of the total UK population and 75% of millennials limiting the amount of alcohol they drink on a night out, we felt now was the right time to launch Lindeman’s 0.5%.

“We know that the wine industry is changing and that consumers and turning to other drinks categories, or choosing not to drink at all. By giving shoppers an alcohol-free alternative from a consumer favourite like Lindeman’s, we are helping to recruit these consumers back into our category and providing the with new ways in which to enjoy our wines.”

Treasury Wine Estates will support the launch of Lindeman’s 0.5% with a marketing campaign, comprising in-store merchandising, social media activity and sampling. All activity will reinforce the new Lindeman’s brand positioning – Better for You, Better for the Community.

The partnership with Club Soda will help get the brand in front of its 35,000 members, alongside a summer of sampling activity at Club Soda’s Mindful Drinking Festival.

Club Soda founder and managing director, Laura Willoughby MBE, said: “We are delighted that Lindeman’s is partnering with the Mindful Drinking Festival this summer. It is vital that drinks brands do not underestimate the potential of the alcohol-free market. People want to enjoy alcohol-free products in the same way others enjoy alcohol. As an experience, not a compromise.

Haku Japanese Vodka is created from Japanese ingredients by the master artisans at the House of Suntory, which is described as “the founding house of Japanese whisky”.

Haku is the sister brand to Suntory's Roku Gin, which hit the market in February last year, securing an early listing in Waitrose. Haku Vodka was created at the same time as Roku but first went into the US market.

Edrington Beam Suntory UK (EBS) announced earlier this year that it planned to bring the vodka over to the UK to add to its House of Suntory collection of premium spirits that are designed to reflect the nature and flavours of Japan.

The premium spirit is made from 100% Japanese white rice. The meticulous process to mill and polish the rice is said to attribute to its mild and subtly sweet flavour.

The process begins in Japan’s Kyushu region (an area historically famous for rice spirit making) where white rice is fermented with koji rice to create a mash. The mash is then distilled through pot stills to create a rice spirit. It is then distilled for a second time through two different processes in a pot still and column still to create a “uniquely flavoured” liquid.

This liquid is then blended and filtered through bamboo charcoal in Osaka, Japan. This process, unique to Suntory, preserves and enhances the rice’s delicately sweet and subtle flavours, according to the producer.

Nick Ganich, Edrington-Beam Suntory UK head of brands for Beam Suntory, said: “The launch of this new vodka creates great opportunity for craft spirits enthusiasts to discover new tastes and experiences that further embody Suntory founder Shinjoro Torii’s vision of a challenge and quest for excellence.”

Haku Vodka has already secured listings in leading UK bars and restaurants such as Nobu, The Ritz and Roka.

It will be on shelf in Waitrose from May 27, at a retail price of £35 for a 70cl bottle.

Kazuyuki Torii, Suntory Specialist for Gin and Spirits, said: “This unique vodka was developed from a vision to create a truly authentic Japanese product that meets the demand for a meticulously crafted vodka with a distinct and balanced taste.”

The vodka can be served neat, on the rocks of in the Haku-Hi, which is made by adding chilled soda water and lemon peel.

The report, which builds on research carried out by the Centre for Economic and Business Research (CEBR), also reveals Scotland’s national drink generates two-thirds of all spirits Gross Value Added (GVA) in the UK.

The industry has also been buoyed by record exports reaching £4.7 billion in 2018, and several new distilleries beginning production and opening their doors to tourists.

Karen Betts, chief executive of the SWA, said: “This research shows the Scotch Whisky industry’s huge contribution to both the Scottish and UK economies.

“Significantly, the research shows that our industry’s GVA increased by 10% to £5.5 billion between 2016 and 2018, as a result of Scotch Whisky companies’ continued export success and the industry’s consistent investment at home – with over £500 million going into production, distribution, marketing and tourism in the last five years.

“Despite the challenges of Brexit, this investment continues to flow, with further projects planned and more distilleries set to open – a sign that the Scotch Whisky industry remains confident about the future. This is great news for our many employees, our investors, our supply chain, and of course, for consumers all over the world who love Scotch.

“This report also highlights the high rate of domestic tax that Scotch Whisky faces in the UK. In the US, Scotch and other whiskies are taxed at just 27% of the rate that HM Treasury taxes us here at home. We will continue to press the Chancellor for fairer treatment for Scotch Whisky in our domestic market, which reflects the vital economic contribution the industry makes to the UK economy every day.”

Scotch Whisky provides £3.8 billion in direct in GVA to Scotland – helped by regulations in place that requires all Scotch Whisky to be matured for at least three years in Scotland.

Rural Economu secretary Fergus Ewing MSP, said: “I welcome the contribution that the Scotch Whisky industry makes to the Scottish Economy.

“The industry’s performance is testament to the hard work of those who work in this important sector, making Scotch Whisky one of Scotland’s greatest global exports.”

The New Wave South Africa importer tasting also takes place on September 3, in London.

WOSA is encouraging producers, importers, retailers and restaurants to participate in the festival and the organisation has developed branded POS materials to support promotions.

The festival has a website www.thesouthafricanwinefestival.com where events from around the UK can be added to the event programme and promoted centrally.

Jo Wehring, WOSA's UK market manager, said: ""The South African Wine Festival offers the UK trade a fantastic opportunity to come together and promote South Africa's wines, widely regarded as the most exciting and dynamic wine producing nations in the world. We anticipate many of our winemakers coming to the UK market during the week, bringing with them the friendly, sunny character of South Africa with their wonderful wines.""

Asda’s Orange Natural Wine hails from the largest winery in Romania, Cramele Recas, and it will be available in the UK from June, priced at £6 per bottle.

The wine is made using local, organic varieties of Feteasca Alba, Tamaioasa Romaneasca, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. It has flavours of quince, pear, a touch of vanilla, and “discreet stone fruit flavours”, with a powerful tannin structure, according to the producer.

The orange colour is made by leaving antioxidant-rich white grape skins in contact with the juice for three and a half weeks at low temperatures. The result is a wine with fruity notes and an “elegantly structured body”. It is also vegan.

Aldi announced last September that it would stock its first orange wine, also priced at £6, but the retailer only acquired 12,500 bottles.

At the time, independent wine merchants, particularly those that specialise in natural wines, expressed some concern about this style of wine bring sold at such a low price point.

Charlie Brown, co-owner of Vino Vero in Essex, told DRN: “Aldi is selling its orange wine basically at cost price, which can be really damaging for independent retailers. Consumers see an orange wine at £6 and then they see one in our shop at £15 to £23 and think we are taking too much margin and the wine isn’t competitively priced. They don’t always realise there will be a difference in quality between, say, our orange wine and the one in Aldi.

She added: “We have noticed an increase in popularity over the past 18 months since they have been getting more media coverage. Most people don’t know what they are but many ask, which shows an interest in the category.

“They are definitely an acquired taste but many things that are an acquired taste have the opportunity to become mainstream.”

Lowlander Beer, which is described as “the pioneer of botanical brewing from the Netherlands” has added a no-alcohol beer to its range.

Lowlander 0.00% Wit (White) Beer has been brewed with reclaimed citrus peel, donated from bars and restaurants who use the fruit to squeeze fresh orange and lemon juice.

The beer has launched in the Netherlands this month and will be introduced to both the UK and Germany over the next few weeks, before being rolled out to other international markets.

Chief botanical officer and founder, Frederik Kampan, said: “With more than a quarter of young people considering themselves non-drinkers and one out of 20 beers being Low or No Alcohol, we felt the time was right to launch our 0.00% Lowlander Beer. Consumers are more health conscious and with the trend for No/ Low Alcohol Drinks, we wanted to be one of the first craft beers to launch a true alcohol-free expression.

“We are also delighted to be able to reuse natural botanical ingredients to brew our beer. Every year 250 million kilos of orange peel are discarded in The Netherlands and we are working with PeelPioneers who pick up and process this ‘waste’ in a circular, eco-friendly way. The result is a refreshing and crisp botanically-brewed beer, with bursts of fruit and citrus flavours.”

The beer will join others in the Lowlander portfolio, including two botanically-brewed low alcohol 2.5% beers: Lowlander Yuzu & Grapefruit and Lowlander Ginger & Kaffir Lime. Its core range includes a White Ale, American Pale Ale, IPA, Porter and 0.00%.

Loire Bucket List aims to reflect the idea that the Loire Valley is the “ultimate wine region to add to your bucket list”, due to its wide range of wine styles, travel experiences and authentic French food.

The campaign kicks off at the start of June and it will include a series of consumer events, competitions and retail promotions with independent wine merchants across the UK.

Claire Duchene, communications director from Loire Valley Wines, said: ““June will be Loire month in London! With the dreamy fairytale like castles, authentic French food and our incredibly diverse range of wine styles, we are absolutely spoilt in the Loire Valley and the aim of this campaign is to show the UK why our region can really offer a memorable experience for wine lovers.

""We chose the idea of the bucket list as the positioning for our campaign in order to capture consumers with a concept, which is relatable, accessible and memorable for our target audience in the UK.

“From Crémant in Tower Bridge and Muscadet along the Regent’s Canal, we’re really looking forward to creating unforgettable moments for consumers in London this summer that will place the iconic Loire Valley right in their wine bucket list!”

As part of the campaign, each weekend there will be a different “route” of restaurants and wine bars serving a specific style of wines from the Loire Valley with the route finishing at a “bucket list” inspired venue in London.

The routes will be: June 5 and 6 will be the Muscadet route, partnering with venues in waterside locations around London; June 15 is the Cremant de Loire route, partnering with venues with memorable views; June 21 and 22 is the Rose route, with west London venues; and June 29 and 30 is the Sauvignon Blanc pop-up at Portobello Road Market.

Loire Valley Wines will also be organising a month-long independent wine merchant promotion, beginning mid-May until the end of June. The trade body will “take over” wine merchants across the country to shine a light on their finest wines from the region.

Drynks Unlimited has invested a further £1 million in technology to “produce the next generation of alcohol-free drinks”.

The UK-based manufacturing, sales and marketing company, which was founded in 2017, focuses entirely on producing alcohol-free drinks.

The latest cash injection is an investment in “the UK’s only state-of-the-art dealcoholisation technology” that uses the cool vacuum distillation process (CVD), which gently removes alcohol from full strength alcohol, while retaining the character and flavour of the original liquid.

Drynks Unlimited will offer a full range of alcohol-free drinks and it is doubling its range of Smashed with the addition of a Smashed Berry and Smashed Citrus in 33cl cans and glass bottles from September this year. The Smashed range uses authentic craft beer and cider which is dealcoholised in the CVD plant to produce a 0% abv drink.

The range also includes Smashed Apple and Smashed Hops, which were launched in October 2018. These two have already secured listings with Selfridges and on-trade outlets.

The company was founded by a team of drinks and leisure industry experts, headed up by ex-Halewood marketing director, Richard Clark.

He said: “The time is right to produce the next generation of premium alcohol-free drinks that offer a truly authentic experience. While there has been an explosion of new NoLo drinks, many are disappointing on taste which may be due to the way they have been produced.

“We are the only UK drinks business to invest in the state-of-the-art cool vacuum dealcoholisation kit that produces a fantastic new taste experience, and we are confident this will add excitement to the category. We’d love consumers and retailers to take the Smashed taste challenge and try our drinks against their current favourite NoLo or soft drink.”

Heineken UK is launching a campaign entitled “Say Yes” to encourage consumers and retailers to explore the thriving alcohol-free beer and cider sector.

The campaign, which launches this month, comprises a series of adverts promoting Heineken UK’s alcohol-free beer and cider range: Heineken 0.0, Birra Moretti Zero and Old Mout Alcohol-Free.

Adverts will demonstrate the role alcohol-free can play through scenarios in your life such as “Say Yes to a mid-week get together with a Birra Moretti Zero” and “Say Yes to ‘another one’ with an Old-Mout cider Alcohol-Free on a Sunday afternoon”.

The No, Low and Gluten-Free Beer category has grown 22% over the past year and Heineken 0.0 grew 133% over the period.

The producer is also supporting retailers by launching “Zero Zones” in the UK, as a result of success with these internationally. Zero Zones are designed to allow stores to strengthen visibility and showcase the broad range of alcohol-free variants in store to help boost profits, as well as ensuring quick and easy convenience for shoppers.

Toby Lancaster, category and shopper marketing director at Heineken, said: “No and low alcohol is currently booming. The beer category is currently experiencing 24% yearly sales value growth and the cider category at 38% growth, with this level of increase expected to continue.

“As more shoppers introduce alcohol-free beer and cider to their repertoire, the Say Yes campaign by Heineken UK and Twelve will accelerate this trend by inspiring new occasions to enjoy, while combating outdated preconceptions once associated with the category.""

The UK’s alcohol-free spirits market is poised for further growth driven by a plethora of new product launches and increased consumer demand, according to the latest research.

Distill Ventures, which is described as “the world’s first independent drinks accelerator” has released a white paper, together with consultancies CGA and IWSR, reaffirming the economic potential of alcohol-free drinks.

The research shows that as of October 2018 there were 42 alcohol-free spirits in the UK market, up from just four in April 2018.

It also highlighted a growing consumer interest in alcohol-free searches online. It showed consumers are searching for inspiration in alcohol-free spirits via words such as ‘Mocktail’, which is up 42%, according to the research.

Meanwhile searches for ‘non-alcoholic’ are up 81% compared to the year earlier with 17% of conversations around alcohol-free drinks coming from consumers aged between 35 and 44.

The research also looked at trends in the on-trade, which will most likely spill over into the off-trade over time. It showed in the UK 55% of restaurants in London have alcohol-free options, compared with 40% in Los Angeles. It said 42% of the wider London on-trade is expecting alcohol-free spirits and aperitifs, alongside alcohol-free beer and wine, to play a key role in their overall sales mix over the next 12 months.

Shilen Patel, co-founder and non-alcohol lead at Distill Ventures, said: “It is incredibly exciting to see these non-alcoholic drinks develop and it is something that we at Distill Ventures fully believe in. Over the last three years we have rapidly grown our dedicated Non-Alc practice within the core business to help founder-led brands grow. Non-Alc founder-led brands now account for around 25% of the brands within our company’s portfolio.”

Rich Woods, author of The Cocktail guy, said: “We are no longer seeing ‘mocktails’ reduced to the back of the menu. These incredibly creative Non-Alc cocktails are not taking centre stage on menus, sharing an equivalent portion of the limelight with their alcoholic siblings. Not wanting to compromise on taste, top bars are innovating really quickly to ensure that equal experiences are given to every guest, regardless of whether or not they are drinking alcohol.”

Barefoot Pinot Grigio and White Zinfandel are now available in a 25cl slimline can format in Tesco stores. They will be stocked in Morrisons from July 1, priced at £2.50 per can.

The launch will be supported by a social media campaign that highlights the benefit of this format. POS material for retailers is also available, with the message “Your favourite Barefoot, now in a can!”

Mark Stammers, sales director for UK and Ireland for E&J Gallo Winery, said: “We know that consumers are leaving the wine category during certain drinking occasions such as house parties, picnics and BBQs because few easy alternatives for ideal packaging exist in wine. Barefoot cans will provide the perfect solution as they are convenient, widely recyclable, easy to chill and open, removing the need for a glass.

“What’s more, the cans can’t smash which is another great benefit when it comes to consumers packing their picnic bags or festival kits, ready to have a great time with friends doing their bit to help the environment.”

Barefoot recommends retailers merchandise the cans in the chilled sections of stores alongside other 25cl ready-to-drink options such as gin & tonic cans and other single serve wine options. If a secondary placement is an option it suggests merchandising the cans alongside the 75cl Barefoot range as well, supported by POS.

Wine buying manager James Bone said the retailer really felt the effects of Dry January in 2016, but since then it has defied the negative sales trend seen elsewhere.

He told DRN: “We have had a good start to the year. Sales have been really positive. We have had a good run from January through to Easter.

“We really felt the Dry January effect three years ago, but not any more. It could be self-fulfilling. If you don’t do your promotions, sales can go down. We wanted to make January as successful as any other month and it has worked. We have seen growth.

“People in the lead up to Christmas stock up and they often have carry-over into January, but they still want to go out and find interesting wines and offers in January. Our relentless focus on quality helps us there.”

The drinks retailing trade enjoyed magnificent sales growth amid an unprecedented heatwave last summer and it faces a stern challenge as it bids to match that performance in 2019.

“It’s going to be challenging to match last year, with that extraordinary spell of great weather,” said Bone. “We had the perfect range of rosé to see a really sustained growth rate. We have always had real strength in Provence and pale style rosé, and now it is absolutely resonating with consumers as well.

“We are hoping that it will be as warm and sunny this year. Waitrose does really well in the sunshine, because we have great food and people love to entertain, and wine plays really well into that.”

Waitrose is encouraging shoppers to experiment with intriguing new varieties by launching a nine-strong W range full of lesser-known gems from around the world.

It includes a Marcelan and Petit Manseng from the south of France, a Pais from Chile, Cannonau from Sardinia, Mencia from Spain, a Zweigelt rosé from Austria, an Elbling from Germany and an Arinto from Portugal, plus a sparkling Pecorino from Italy.

Bone told DRN: “We have the Blueprint range [selling at £5.99 to £9.99] and that covers the classic styles and varieties. This range is designed to introduce new varieties that perhaps people haven’t heard of.

“It retails at £6.99 to £9.99, so there’s a really nice overlap with the Blueprint range. It’s accessible and we hope it will encourage people to experiment with new things.

“It was a big team effort. We all had to determine the grape varieties we would choose and to be sure that these were the best expressions.

“We worked with our stores development team to find an additional merchandising unit. People need to see these wines as a group. They would be lost as nine products on a fixture of hundreds of wines. In lots of branches they will be on display towers, with lots of POS.

“It has been a fun process. We have really enjoyed it. We have had to devise technical standards in some regions and we have done due diligence.

“We have had to make some judgement calls [on volume]. Some of them will exceed our expectations, and some will be under. We will become more expert at this as we go. We have chosen these because we think they have the potential to be more popular varieties in the future. If they don’t prove to be successful, we will cycle in new things, like the ones that didn’t make the initial cut. If they sell really well we will transition them into the Blueprint range. This is a vehicle to make them popular.”

The team trawled through the John Lewis archives to find inspiration for the label design. “The W on the label is interesting,” said Bone. “It comes from our archives, as this W was on Waitrose bills and receipts in the 1930s and 1940s. The label gives good prominence to the grape varieties and we are really pleased with it.”

A juniper-forward London Dry Gin was chosen for the Indian and Refreshingly Light Gin & Tonics while a lightly floral gin has been used for the Elderflower Gin & Tonic, to give it a delicate aroma.

Rose Cottingham, senior innovation manager, said: “The continued popularity of the G&T is drawing in consumers in ever greater numbers and our new ‘ready-to-drink’ range provides consumers with a convenient way of enjoying a perfectly paired G&T without having to compromise on quality. The range has been inspired by our favourite flavour combinations and reflects the same commitment to the highest quality ingredients, botanicals and taste that is at the heart of all of our products.”

A number of forces have conspired against the UK’s high-strength beer and cider category over the past few years.

Local authorities launched Reducing the Strength schemes that bullied retailers for into stripping shelves of ciders and beers above 5.5% abv or 6% abv. Scotland introduced minimum unit pricing and Wales is set to follow suit, with England under pressure to fall in line. The anti-alcohol lobby seems hell-bent on wiping out white cider and has launched a PR campaign that has seen national media run several damning stories based on its unsubstantiated research.

Even the Portman Group is lending a hand, ruling that single-serve, non-resealable containers should not contain more than four units. Throw in duty rises and the chief medical officer’s reduction of weekly guidelines for men from 21 to 14 units and now is not a great time to be a purveyor of high-strength, value ciders and beers.

Enter stage left Nigel McNally, former managing director at Wells & Young’s, who set up Brookfield Drinks in 2012. The first thing he did was relaunch the Kestrel brand, renowned for its 9% abv Super lager. His next move was to acquire Diamond White, the high-strength cider, plus 7.5% abv sister brand White Star. Brookfield has since launched lower-abv offerings from Kestrel, taken on UK distribution of Portuguese lager Super Bock and launched a premium bottled ale and a gin. But it still has a large chunk of its eggs in the high-strength, value basket.

You might think McNally’s timing was disastrous, but these brands are enjoying strong growth and he is now aiming to fight government intervention that has proved ineffective at targeting problem drinking. Of MUP he says: “While ministers had hoped the laws would deter problem drinkers from buying easily affordable beverages such as high-strength cider and own-brand spirits, it has had the opposite effect in terms of trying to curb total alcohol consumption.

“MUP in Scotland was introduced on May 1, 2018, and over the 46 weeks to March 29, 2019, Scots bought 203.5 million litres of alcohol, 1.8 million more compared to the same period in 2017-18 [Nielsen]. The extra alcohol consumed amounted to the equivalent of 4 million cans of lager or 2.5 million bottles of wine.”

Many in the industry think better education and targeted intervention would be far more effective than blanket measures such as minimum unit pricing and Reducing the Strength schemes, which punish responsible drinkers and retailers and fail to help people drinking to dangerous levels. “The government should interfere less in the dynamics of the marketplace for alcohol, but instead start spending on educating people about alcohol consumption,” he says. “Despite receiving almost £10 billion from duty last year, the only spend on media connected with alcohol education over the past two years was the grand total of £2 million, and that was spent by [industry funded charity] Drinkaware.”

He calls the lack of government spending on alcohol education “a national scandal”.

McNally makes interesting points around the tactics employed by the authorities, and presents a leftfield analogy surrounding the environment. “In both beer and cider markets we need to be careful of the environmental impact of production,” he says. “The government would like us to drink lower-abv products, despite evidence that people drinking higher-abv beer and cider do so more responsibly [this comes from ONS research suggesting that, on their heaviest drinking days, consumers were more likely to opt for normal-strength beer and cider than high strength]. An issue the government hasn’t considered is the environmental impact of lower-abv beers and ciders compared to higher-abv products.

“This is in terms of increased waste, raw materials, water, pollution and road damage. It is estimated some 636 million cans of cider are sold in the UK off-trade each year. About 64% of this volume comes from the top-selling mainstream brands with an average abv of 4-4.5%. If, hypothetically, the drinkers of this volume were to switch to consuming the same number of alcohol units but from a higher-strength cider such as 7.5% abv, then 40% of these cans could be ceased from production.

“This would remove around 3,367 trunkers of cider from the roads, saving 64 trunker movements each week, offering environmental and congestion benefits: 160 million cans saved would reach the top of Everest 10 times and over 8,900 tonnes of aluminium could be taken out of production each year. Water consumption would be at least halved, together with halving the energy costs associated with production. I have given an extreme situation but nevertheless I believe the point is important.

“Westminster Council has imposed a blanket ban on beers and ciders above 5.5% abv,” he adds, referring to the local authority’s variation on the Reducing the Strength scheme. “At the same time, it supports congestion charges and wants less pollution for residents. By implementing its ban on beers and ciders above 5.5% abv, it is encouraging more trucks into London, with lower-strength beer and ciders causing more pollution. I guess the point is any government interference in market dynamics will have unintended consequences.”

He also lays into the sugar content of some lower-abv drinks. “Sugar in alcohol is going to come to the surface very soon and here we can see that certain ciders, notably fruit ciders, are the worst offenders,” he says. “While many fruit ciders contain lower abv points, the sugar and calorie content are far greater than traditional dry ciders. It is interesting to note here that Diamond, which has the highest abv among this group, has the lowest sugar content.”

Petrassi’s strong and stable leadership of the UK’s most experienced supermarket wine-buying team provides a welcome tonic to the churn seen at many multiple retailers. He moved to Waitrose in 2010 and has developed into the most influential figure in the wine trade over the past nine years. Petrassi has put together a talented buying team featuring Xenia Irwin MW, Nick Room, Alexandra Mawson, Becky Hull MW, Maria Elener, Victoria Mason and Daphne Teremetz, and they have compiled the most exciting range of any multiple grocer.

Waitrose has 360 stores across the UK and it significantly overtrades in wine due to the strength of its offering. It is able to convince affluent shoppers to trade up to interesting wines from around the world through the quality of its merchandising, its category management and its in-store wine advisors. This sets it up as a genuine rival to independent wine merchants across the country. It is also well placed to capitalise as Brits turn their backs on the on-trade amid economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit, while still wanting to enjoy affordable luxuries from the comfort of their own homes.

Yet Waitrose is also a destination for shoppers who want great value wines in the £6-£9 bracket as they can find some intriguing selections in its Blueprint range. It boasts an extremely strong range within Champagne and English sparkling wine, and Kantar data also suggests that it has grown its share of the bubbly market from 8.5% to 9% over the past year. It continues to push boundaries within the multiple retail channel and just this month it launched its first English orange wine, plus two canned English wines. It now stocks 54 organic wines from 18 countries, and it is experiencing 57% year-on-year growth in this area after selling an all-organic 12-bottle wine case for £123, featuring the likes of Bonterra’s organic Chardonnay from Mendocino, Tsantali’s organic Cabernet Sauvignon from Greece and Gabriel Meffre’s organic Côtes du Rhône red blend.

It is a team effort, but Petrassi must be given credit for creating an environment in which buyers are encouraged to take risks with drinks they believe in. Waitrose is not beholden to quarterly reports to the City, so Petrassi’s team is able to make bold, generational decisions that can genuinely shape the nation’s wine-drinking habits. It has stuck to its guns over the past year, resisting any pressure to engage in range rationalisation or supplier culls, and it continues to forge strong relationships with suppliers across the globe, particularly in the Old World. The retailer continues to seize awards for its wine offering, while the UK’s most respected wine writers pay a great deal of attention to what it does. Petrassi’s influence extends to the boards of the Wine & Spirit Trade Association and the Masters of Wine Endowment Trust and he is a passionate advocate of responsible drinking.

James is celebrating a decade in the Aldi wine buying team this year and has led the retailer on a remarkable journey. The German discounter has seized huge swathes of grocery market share from the traditional Big Four supermarkets and that is largely down to its wine offering. It offers a fantastic price-to-quality ratio, underpinned by impressive results in tasting competitions, and it has made a big deal of this in its marketing. That has helped drive the middle classes into Aldi stores and Nielsen data recently suggested that it has overtaken Morrisons to become the fourth-largest supermarket in the UK. Yet James is not resting on his laurels and he has just launched Aldi’s first still English wine, while bolstering the range from Portugal and sourcing all manner of gems from lesser-known regions in France. James is respected by many suppliers and producers and his skill as a buyer ensures Aldi punches well above its weight in the wine category. The team continues to grow, with Josh Heley and Andrew Clarke recently joining, and Aldi should remain a strong force in the wine trade for many years to come.

Godley recently took over as BWS director at the UK’s largest retailer and he is tasked with maintaining the team’s impressive recent performance. Tesco has just reported a 28% jump in profits as its turnaround plan nears completion and its wine department has delivered substantial value growth over the past year. Some suppliers may feel there is too much churn in supermarket buying teams to establish effective working relationships, but Tesco remains keen to maintain a revolving carousel of department heads. Rob Cooke headed up the wine team for less than two years after replacing Gavin Warburton, and now it is Godley’s turn. He has been at Tesco for 24 years and in that time he has been in charge of various categories, including crisps and frozen foods, while also heading up its Malaysian operations. He was most recently director for impulse and One Stop, but he is no stranger to BWS, having served as senior buying manager for beer from 2002-2004 and then wine category manager from 2004-2008. Tesco’s volume clout in the marketplace remains unrivalled and it will be intriguing to see how its wine offering develops under Godley’s stewardship.

The spectre of Brexit looms large over the wine industry and Beale has consistently campaigned for a frictionless trade deal with the EU. He will need to redouble his lobbying efforts in the months ahead, as it is an extremely challenging time for the hundreds of businesses he represents in Westminster. The WSTA seeks to remove barriers to trade and facilitate market access, and rarely has its work been more vital. Beale was disappointed to see months of campaigning for a duty freeze end in failure as wine was singled out for a clobbering at the last Budget, while beer, cider and spirits were unaffected. Yet this is an annual battle and he will need the entire trade to get behind him as he bids to persuade the government to give wine a fair deal this year. It will be up to Beale and his team to demonstrate the economic benefits of a healthy UK wine industry and present these messages in a more assertive fashion.

Ask any big wine supplier which rival they most admire these days and the answer is typically Gallo. Barefoot has been on a tear since Sorrentino took over as UK general manager and it has firmly established itself as the most dynamic major brand on the market. It has enjoyed 19% value growth over the past year to overtake Echo Falls, Blossom Hill and McGuigan and surge up to number two in the chart of the UK’s bestsellers. It is fast catching up on market leader Hardys and it could soon rise to the summit. The Californian behemoth has another top 10 brand in Gallo Family Vineyards, while it continues to bolster its premium portfolio. It boasts all manner of iconic wineries from the Golden State, and it has recently begun selling Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc and Provence rosé on our shores. But Barefoot is the star of the show and it has succeeded by making wine fun, accessible, flavourful, affordable and inclusive. Sorrentino sits on the WSTA board and he welcomed Boris Johnson to the Gallo offices last year as part of his lobbying efforts.

The supermarket chain’s rising credibility and commercial performance in wine has been a slow-burn affair since Jarman took on a leading wine role in the organisation six years ago. Morrisons was named multiple wine retailer of the year in our own Drinks Retailing Awards at the start of 2019 and has been shortlisted in the supermarket category of the International Wine Challenge in four years out of the past five, winning on two occasions. Jarman’s hands-on approach has resulted in makeovers for several sections of the wine range, such as changing around 80% of Morrisons’ South African portfolio to reflect the diversity of its wines. Jarman has more than 30 years’ experience in the drinks business, having worked in wine for Safeway, Somerfield and First Quench back in the day, before taking a detour to the supply side with Allied Domecq, Waverley TBS and Seckford Agencies, and taking the head of wine operations job at his current employer in 2013.

Cairns was a wine buyer for both Spar and Morrisons before moving to give the Co-op’s wine department a good shake-up in 2013. Cairns has been very much hands-on and in the industry eye since taking on the overall BWS role a year later, tailoring ranges to suit individual store locations and magnifying the chain’s reputation for a great balance between quality and price. The Co-op has long been the champion of Fairtrade wine in the UK retail market, a role it enhanced last year by pledging to convert more of its South African range to the ethical watermark. Glowing total wine sales have been exceeded by growth in mini-bottles, boxes and 50cl sizes as it exploits its convenience position to the full. The Co-op is currently enjoying a run of three successive victories in the national convenience chain section of the International Wine Challenge.

The Chilean producer has been steadily edging its way up the league table of off-trade wine sales for several years, with Doyle keeping a steady hand on the rudder throughout. The portfolio’s lead brand, Casillero del Diablo, is among the biggest sellers in UK supermarkets, while Cono Sur and the Argentinian brand Trivento both play powerful supporting roles. Doyle has chalked up 18 years with CyT, having joined the company from the Australian mega wine outfit Southcorp. He has laid down ambitious plans to increase the number of UK households buying its wines by a million over three years, and has been a significant voice in the informal trade campaign to drive move value and margin into the business of producing, distributing and selling wine. Casillero commands the highest average price in the off-trade’s top 10 wine brands, with seemingly no hindrance to its growth figures.

Last year’s acquisition of the Freixenet cava firm by Copestick Murray owner Henkel of Germany created the world’s largest supplier of sparkling wine. It led Copestick Murray to merge with Freixenet UK and create the UK’s largest fizz supplier, headed by Copestick and Damian Clarke. It added the Friexenet portfolio to a line-up that already included Mionetto, Follador and the phenomenally successful Prosecco branch of the I Heart brand – which at one point last year was posting annual sales increases of 80%, according to IRI. Even before Henkel came on board, Copestick was the driving force behind rapid growth for the company that he founded with Paul Murray back in 2005, but his increased clout in the wine aisles of the supermarkets and the acquisitions of online retailer Slurp and the French wines supplier Free Run Wines pushes him further up this year’s chart. Before striking out alone, Copestick worked for Spanish importer Moreno and McGuigan of Australia. He began his career selling Freixenet Cordon Negro and now his name stands proudly alongside it. Freixenet Copestick looks like a dynamic wine supplier with great potential for future growth.

The boss of the UK’s biggest wine supplier, with a portfolio that includes the big-hitters Hardys, Echo Falls and Kumala, is still a relative newcomer to the distribution side of the nation’s wine industry. McKeon worked in spirits for Beam Global and beer for Cobra before taking the reins at the Asda BWS department in 2010, increasing both its market clout and profile at the time. He joined Accolade in early 2017, since when the company has come under increased pressure from rival brands, but it’s still fighting for space on the leading supermarkets’ shelves with innovative ideas. Echo Falls has broken out of its California box to enter the booming Italian fizz market with the inspired name Prosecho Falls, and Hardys, Kumala and the New Zealand brand Mud House have all appeared in 50cl bottles as Accolade looks to stretch consumer purchasing occasions of its leading brands.

It’s perhaps lazy and unfair to cite Twitter stats as a measure of importance, but if we point out that Robert Parker – arguably the world’s most famous wine communicator – has just over 20,000 followers, then the 257,000 who hang on Robinson’s every word (or should that be 280 characters) give you an idea of just how much clout her views on wine can carry. Robinson is the editor of the Oxford Companion to Wine – the industry’s Encyclopedia Britannica or Bible, depending who you’re talking to – and has a weekly column in the Financial Times and another that is syndicated globally.

Brampton took the top job at TWE’s operation in the UK last year. She’s already made her mark by laying out a strategy to achieve growth for TWE’s brands in a market where other major producers have arguably been enjoying a happier time recently looking at the sales graph on the office wall. Treasury has a big-hitting portfolio with the likes of Penfolds, Blossom Hill and Wolf Blass, and it has been innovating to reach a millennial audience in the form of the twin, tech-driven, his-and-her brands 19 Crimes and Embrazen. Brampton joined the Wine & Spirit Trade Association board last month.

Newman’s recent focus at Sainsbury’s has been on beefing up its own-label wine offering, particularly with the premium Taste the Difference brand. Working with its team of in-house winemakers, the chain has introduced new TTD lines from Rhône and Bordeaux, and it has been going great guns on premium Italian reds. Fizz has also had a bit of TLC with sparkling wine buyer Louise Loveder adding pink Crémant de Loire and rethinking its TTD cava. Newman was handed the top BWS job at the supermarket chain four years ago, having previously occupied a number of non-drinks roles. She joined Sainsbury’s from the magazine publisher IPC Media.

Hatch Mansfield manages to pull off the neat trick of being one of the UK’s highest grossing branded wine suppliers while still operating in a distinctly premium environment. It’s one of the few importers with a significant presence in supermarkets that doesn’t get a routine cold shoulder from independent specialists, many of whom cite the consistent support they’ve had from the company over the years for their continued loyalty. Its performance may be down to stable management, with McGrath chalking up a quarter of a century in the top job this year. Italian family-owned producer Gaja joined the Hatch portfolio in 2018.

Laithwaite’s founder Tony Laithwaite published his autobiography earlier this year, recounting the journey from washing bottles at a Bordeaux winery to building the UK’s most successful, long-established, direct-to-consumer wine importer. The latest stage has seen it navigate steadily from mail order into the digital age, while opening a string of bricks-and-mortar shops that if/when Majestic goes will make it one of the UK’s biggest wine chains. Thatcher has his hand on today’s Direct Wines group, of which Laithwaite’s is the biggest chunk, bringing expertise from a slew of high-level jobs in TV and telecoms.

How time flies. Christensen is probably still seen by many in the UK wine trade as the former boss of Accolade, but next month actually chalks up half a decade in the Enotria role. During that time it’s become an increasingly weighty presence in the industry and it has made several additions to its portfolio in the past year. Perhaps the most significant was a deal with San Pedro Tarapaca of Chile but it also signed up the Aussie producer Chaffey Bros and Kir-Yianni from Greece. Christensen himself became a trustee of wine trade charity The Benevolent, adding the role to another external post as a board member of the Wine & Spirit Trade Association.

The stock market reacted with some alarm to the announcement in March that the Majestic brand and operation was being reeled in, to favour a digital-heavy presence under the Naked Wines name that Gormley brought to the group with the Naked acquisition of 2015. Trade enthusiasm for the news has been scant, with many commentators reacting with dismay to a retreat from a business model that has produced so much talent in the past. Gormley tumbles down this year’s list from a top-five place last year as the industry and Majestic employees wait to hear 

 more about the details of 

 his plans.

It’s been a busy time for Jewell in the past year as the generic body looks to ensure Australia retains its position as the UK’s favourite source for imported wine, with the off-trade alone selling over £1 billion worth of the stuff every year. Sales are on the up too, with initiatives such as the autumn Off the Vine tasting and the Australian Wine Discovered trade education platform helping to give the country a year-round profile beyond the huge annual generic tasting in London each January. Jewell was previously on the buying team at Tesco and has been an MW since 1997.

The Virgin Wines boss was no doubt raising a glass last month, as Lincoln City FC, of which he’s been a director since 2017, secured a second promotion in three years to take them into the EFL League One. It wasn’t the first time Wright’s had reason to celebrate in recent years, as the wine business which he’s co-owned since an MBO from Direct Wines in 2013 has gone from strength to strength to become one of the UK’s best online wine retailers. Wright took over the Virgin reins in 2008 on the departure of Rowan Gormley to form Naked Wines and now sits just behind him in the Top 100.

The description “broadcaster” barely begins to cover Fattorini’s all-rounder status and considerable trade and consumer profile. Having previously worked for Bibendum and Matthew Clark, The Wine Show presenter known as Obi-Wine Kenobi last year signed up with the Fields Morris & Verdin division of Berry Bros & Rudd to be its new head of sales in London. He’s also a wine ambassador for Celebrity Cruises and once had a gig talking to golf fans in the US about his favourite subject as a consultant to the PGA Tour. Second favourite subject: Ironman triathlons, which keep him trim between all those trade functions.

You’d think after 22 years that Liberty Wines and the man who founded it would have discovered just about everything there is that’s worth importing from Italy. But it’s still managing to unearth new gems from the country on which Gleave forged its reputation, with Mandrarossa from Sicily joining the portfolio in early 2019. That wasn’t the only new addition in the past 12 months as Liberty also added the Chinese producer Kanaan, Bodega Garzón from Uruguay and, most impressively, Piper-Heidsieck Champagne. Gleave founded Liberty after leaving what was then Enotria Wines and its latest accounts show turnover of just under £68 million.

Casella’s Yellow Tail brand is flying in the mainstream off-trade, sending Lawson up 24 places since last year’s Most Influential run-down. The family-owned Australian brand has struck a chord among UK consumers with its accessible style and distinctive packaging, backed by a £2 million marketing campaign last year to get more people tasting its wines for the first time. It’s all very familiar territory for Lawson, who was previously managing director of Diageo’s Percy Fox wine operation in the era when it took Blossom Hill racing to the very top of the UK wine charts.

Saunders returned to Bibendum a year ago to help navigate the supplier through the choppy waters that had been whipped up by the stormy collapse of previous owner Conviviality. Under C&C Group’s ownership, the company seems to be gradually getting back on course, renewing its long-term reputation for good-quality wine and excellence in customer service. Saunders had been Bibendum’s boss from its more humble beginnings in 1982 until Conviviality took over in 2016. He crowned a momentous year in 2018 by being named chairman of trade charity The Benevolent as the new year began.

Asda has been busy building its entry-level and alcohol-free propositions respectively with the launches of The Wine List and Be Free ranges, but its year has been mostly spent in the shadow of the protracted proposed merger with Sainsbury’s. Of the two parties the deal’s demise at the hands of regulators last month feels like worse news for Asda’s wine department, whose offering is more vulnerable to discounter challenges. Tiffin returned to BWS in 2016, a department he had previously been involved in as the beer-buying manager from 2008 to 2011.

Fells strengthened its hand in the premium echelons of the UK wine market last year when Australian producer Yalumba bought a 10% stake in the business and transferred all its distribution into the company. Moody now forms a partnership with Simon Thorpe MW, former boss of Yalumba’s standalone Negociants UK operation, while the Aussie producer is part of a formidable triumvirate of Fells shareholders, completed by the Symington port family and Torres of Spain. Other agency firms must look on with admiration and a little envy at a portfolio that also includes famous names such as Guigal, Champagne Henriot, Barone Ricasoli and Bouchard Père & Fils.

Ellis and the Pernod Ricard wine team have a long-standing focus on pushing the category in a more premium direction and they decided to cut back promotional activity this year. The spirits giant remains one of the UK’s largest and most important wine suppliers, but it is determined to promote long-term category health and sustainability, and that has seen it take a hit on volume sales. Brancott Estate is enjoying strong growth, but Jacob’s Creek has declined significantly as it focuses on higher-end styles that offer better supply chain margins, rather than trying to compete with rivals at the bottom end of the market.

The shrinking role of bricks and mortar in wine retailing should, in theory, play into the hands of the members’ co-operative, which sells everything it sources at long distance, either online or through more traditional remote mechanisms such as order forms and postage stamps. But the society’s older customer base poses challenges to Finlan, who took on the role last year, as more glitzy, interactive e-commerce platforms reach out to the younger audience that will be the wine drinking mass of the future. Finlan joined from shoe retailer Clarks and has spent time with Marks & Spencer, Gap and Thomas Cook.

Sagar reveals a liking for a pint of Guinness on his company website profile but it’s in the wine category that his company is becoming an increasing off-trade force. Kingsland produces a string of own-labels for Tesco, Morrisons and Ocado and is rapidly expanding its portfolio of company-owned brands and agencies with Australia’s Vandenberg, Germany’s Schmitt Söhne and new pouches in its sheep-themed Shorn range joining in the past year. Investment in packaging capability will make Kingsland the biggest wine bottling business in the UK, according to the company.

Under Harris’ 17-year stewardship, the WSET has grown from being the UK’s premier wine education organisation to a global leader in industry qualifications, with more than 700 approved programme providers in 70 countries. WSET courses are delivered in 17 languages and can be taken everywhere from Malta to Myanmar and from Iceland to Indonesia. Since the body was founded in 1969, more than 500,000 people have completed one of its courses and it chalked up 13 consecutive years of growth double-digit growth in 2017/18.

It’s seven years since Dyer crossed the road from wine retail to the supply side to handle new business development at the UK arm of the producer behind the famous McGuigan brand. Having quickly been elevated to general manager for the UK and Europe, the former Sainsbury’s wine buyer was promoted to his current position last year, at the same time as Cameron Ferguson took on a similar role covering Australia and the US. Recent launches from the company include the Delight range of de-alcoholised wines that are being listed by Marks & Spencer.

It’s 30 years since Boutinot began making wine for the first time. Since that first foray into France, it’s also set up its own or partnership winemaking ventures in Italy, South Africa and England. This approach sets it apart in the competitive world of UK wine distribution, which is dominated by big brands and classically-structured agency firms. The company has grown rapidly since Whiteley led a management buyout in 2013, its mix of wines at a range of price points helping it build relationships with supermarkets, independents and quality on-trade accounts.

Off-Piste’s Most Wanted range may win the prize for the most appropriately named wine of the past few years. Demand for the brand with the cheeky MW logo has led to a string of NPD in the form of varietals from Australia, California and Italy, Prosecco, single-serve cans and other fizz. Buyers from Tesco, Sainsbury’s Marks & Spencer and the Co-op have all bought into the pan-globally-sourced brand. Letheren shares chief executive role with Ant Fairbank, with whom he founded Off-Piste in 2007 on the guiding principle that “wine is fun”.

The Sussex-based producer has been a major presence in the English wine market for many years and a growing force since Roberts took the top job at the family business five years ago. In addition to Ridgeview’s own wines, the producer’s winemaking team oversees English fizz production for the likes of Marks & Spencer, Laithwaite’s, The Wine Society and Waitrose. A £1.8 million winery upgrade will double its capacity to 500,000 bottles a year by 2023. Roberts, a former PwC auditor and Nat West analyst, is also on the board of the Wine & Spirit Trade Association.

While other c-store fascia groups plough through the machinations of tie-ins to major retailer operators, Spar has been getting on with its own thing and reaping growing wine sales as a result. Evans brings big-player experience to the party from First Quench and travel retailer Nuance. The symbol group’s Regional Selection has recently been made available in all of its stores, establishing a three-tier hierarchy of good, best and better wines that aims to take convenience customers on an upwards journey of discovery in the category.

There was no little scepticism when exiled Russian phone store magnate Yevgeny Chichvarkin announced in 2012 that he was creating the world’s best wine shop in the heart of London’s swanky Mayfair district. But, aided by the reported US$400 million sale of his Russian business, its mix of world-scouring buying and sumptuous attention to service and retail detail has pretty much delivered on the promise. Chichvarkin attributes its success in no small part to the drive of former St Petersburg art dealer Fokina, who has headed the Hedonism operation since its inception.

The bulk shipment and private-label specialist has been gradually extending its reach in the branded arena with products such as Proudly Vegan. It joined a range that includes Three Mills and Minivino in 2018 and demonstrates that the company is tuned into the drinks trends of the future. Broadland invested £1 million in new winery equipment to keep up with increasing demand in late 2018 and kickstarted 2019 with the launch of the Live Kindly Drinks low and no-alcohol offshoot. Apart from a brief sidestep to become chairman during the short-lived tenure of Paul Schaafsma as boss, Lansley has been Broadland chief executive since 2006.

It must be close to the definition of having made it when you find yourself the subject of a question on the teatime TV quiz show The Chase. “Olly Smith is a TV expert on which subject?” a contestant was asked on a recent episode. Universal recognition is obviously a little way off as the contestant chose “gardening” over wine and the third option of fashion, but Smith is certainly one of the highest-profile TV wine pundits around, with a regular spot on Saturday Kitchen. He also has a column in the Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine and is a presenter on Radio 2.

Lanchester recently outlined investment plans it claims will make its Greencroft bottling operation the UK’s largest by next year. But it’s the way Lanchester has grown recently that has been inspirational to the rest of the industry as much as the growth itself. A focus on renewable energy sources at its County Durham base means it is carbon-minus in environmental impact and its use of reusable flexi-tanks for bulk shipping – as in a new range for Adnams last year – reduces shipping and carbon costs.

With much of high street wine retailing in retreat, Vagabond has emerged as one of the few with ambitious growth plans that have a realistic feel. Finch gained £3.5 million backing from private equity investor Imbiba last year as he looks to roll out the on/off hybrid format that has wowed central London to other parts of the UK, Europe and the US. The company has also started making English wines at the urban winery in its store in the shadow of Battersea Power Station, using grapes from vineyards in Kent, Surrey and Oxfordshire.

Rudd took over the day-to-day running of the top-end London wine merchant at the start of the year after it decided to part company with chief executive Dan Jago. She became chairman at the end of 2017, replacing Simon Berry. That was an exciting time for the firm, soon after the opening of its 63 Pall Mall store, which brought a modern retail aesthetic to Berry Bros’ historic role in the fine wine arena. Rudd’s career in the family-run business began in the marketing team on the Cutty Sark whisky brand.

Anderson took the lead wine role at the “Waitrose of the north” five years ago after working as a buyer on the supply side of the industry with Armit Wines. A rebrand of the Booths own-label range has delivered increased sales and a steady stream of awards from international wine competitions.

Bewes has just completed his first decade in the managing director’s chair at Hallgarten after joining the company from Liberty Wines, where he was commercial director. His time at Hallgarten has seen it enhance its reputation as one of the leading players in the agency portfolio business in the UK.

Darlington’s company has acquired a reputation for revealing the forgotten and undiscovered corners of the wine world since he set it up in 2012. Like the animal that supplies its name, rarity is a defining characteristic and recent additions include obscure Turkish grape varieties and 200-year-old vines in Etna. Conquering the wine-on-tap arena is now high on the list of priorities.

The west London wine shop chain has had a new lease of life since Sturges joined from Berry Bros & Rudd four years ago. Its stores have been transformed into a modern update on the traditional British wine merchant, showing that the right investment can put bricks-and-mortar retailing on an upward trajectory.

Atkin has a consumer profile from his time as a national newspaper wine columnist but his trade footprint has become just as important. His series of reports on the likes of Chile, Rioja and South Africa have become essential tools in helping buyers make sense of the wine scene in some of the key countries supplying the UK market.

In Calvet, Les Grands Chais de France has the biggest single French wine brand in the UK off-trade, though its fortunes have waned in recent times in the wake of strong competition from several New World rivals. Early 2019 focus is on a range for indies and the on-trade through its Famille Helfrich division.

Steip has headed the UK operation of the company whose brands include the Veuve Clicquot, Dom Perignon and Krug Champagnes for the past two years, but his involvement with the Möet empire goes back to the 1990s. Möet brand sales have proved resilient in a Champagne market that is in decline in post-Prosecco times.

Early 2018 saw Wilson take on the managing director role at the company she founded in 2014 with Joy Edmondson and Hamish Gillespie. Its wide-ranging portfolio includes wines from De Bortoli of Australia and Italy’s The Wine People, both of which have stakes in the North South business.

Exports of South African wine to the UK rose by 5% in 2018 to pass the £100 million mark, cementing the market’s position as the number one destination for its producers. Wehring has had her hand on South African wine’s tiller in the UK since 2007 when she jumped ship from the world of agency PR.

Jukes is best known for his column for the Daily Mail, but his industry influence is just as keenly felt in his self-published reports on Burgundy and Bordeaux’s en primeur markets and Piemonte. His 100 Best Australian Wines roadshow tours the UK and China and earned him the title Honorary Australian of the Year in 2012.

Tynan is on record as naming Withnail & I as his favourite alcohol-featuring film, famous for its protagonists’ demand for “the finest wines available to humanity”, a more measured approach to which might be a guiding light in Alliance buying policy. The company features high on the favoured supplier lists of many independent wine shops.

Fontannaz and his company are the market-leading suppliers of Fairtrade wine to the UK, both through own-label and branded projects such as Fairhills. The UK consumes 40% of the wine supplied by Origin and is its biggest single export market. Its Craft & Origin brand aims to break the mould for wine bottle design.

Goode is one of the few bloggers to graduate to the more formal description of wine writer, largely because he marries intelligent appreciation of the realities of life in the vineyard and the commercial world to appreciation of the contents of a glass. Lectures, judging and expert media appearances all feature on an award-studded CV.

his year marks the 25th anniversary of Matthew Hennings joining the family firm started by his grandfather, Charles, in 1960. It’s since become a major player in the market in its Sussex home, where it has four shops, and further afield through e-commerce. It is the biggest member of the Vindependents buying group.

The Prosecco-led, non-Champagne fizz boom hasn’t been kind to Lanson’s off-trade sales, but the UK remains the producer’s biggest export market. Beavis has been heading the UK operation for the past 10 years, throughout which Wimbledon tennis fortnight – of which Lanson has been the official bubbly for many years – has been a key time for the brand’s marketing.

Last year’s exhibition was Tovey’s first in the London Wine Fair hot seat and she got off to a flying start. Visitor figures were 17% up on 2017 with new features such as the Innovation Zone scoring with the punters. Further new features for 2019 could see the fair continue its renaissance.

Chile’s product reliability and strong trading ties with the UK have seen it steadily move up the sales charts over many years. Jackson has been at the promotional body’s helm for the past five of 15 years with the organisation and previously worked in the wine departments at both Oddbins and Sainsbury’s.

The Co-op’s acquisition of Nisa a year ago has given extra buying power to the group, to the benefit of its 3,500 member convenience stores. Before joining Nisa to head its wine operation in 2017, Douglas was a senior buyer with the Enterprise Inns pub company.

Sauvignon Blanc has driven double-digit annual growth for New Zealand but its European generic marketing chief is faced with the task of expanding its appeal beyond what has become its cornerstone grape variety. Stroud is now seven years into the role, which he took on after working on a clutch of top Aussie brands including Penfolds and Wolf Blass.

Walsh took over at South African powerhouse Distell after six years in a senior role at Boutinot, while he has also worked for Diageo and Cobra and is a qualified solicitor. He now looks after brands including Nederberg and Durbanville Hills, along with some big Scotch whisky and cider labels, and his vision involves growing market share via a focus on quality, reassurance, trust and strong relationships.

There are few more challenging roles in drink than the one taken on by Cresswell at the start of the year: to inject renewed energy into Bargain Booze, Wine Rack and their related brands bought by Bestway after the collapse of Conviviality. He was previously managing director at forecourt operator MRH.

The Sussex wine producer has been one of the leading lights in the rise of English fizz over the past decade.

Wregg and Les Caves de Pyrene always come up in trade conversations around the subject of “natural” wines in their various forms. The company was championing indigenous grapes, organic viticulture and minimum intervention before many in the trade even knew it was a thing and Wregg has been the main conduit between retailers and producers.

Indigo is one of the new breed of smallish importers bringing in unusual, artisanal wines to the UK, and has quickly become one of the most-dropped names among the top tier of independent wine stores. Henshaw set up the business in 2003 after working for the property website Up My Street.

Chatel’s London wine shop chain has taken a hit as Borough focuses more on wholesaling, but its stores still show how high street drinks retailing can appeal providing you’ve got a creative intent and a sound commercial approach. Borough is now looking to get on the front foot as a supplier after selling its barrel wines to other off-trade indies.

Bampfield’s client list over the years has included the likes of Chile’s Santa Rita and Champagne’s Dom Pérignon.

Echo Falls was once just a Californian wine brand, but it has been pushed firmly out of its heartland over the past couple of years.

It now includes a flavoured vodka, as rosé infused with gin, a Prosecco – which, of course, had to be named Prosecco Falls – plus all manner of fruit wines.

Echo Falls Summer Berries Pink Gin is the latest addition to the range and it sees Accolade continue its effort to seize market share in the UK’s dynamic spirits category.

 Rival Treasury Wine Estates recently launched Blossom Hill Gin Fizz after the gin category grew volume sales by 41% in 2018.

David White, marketing director at Accolade, said: “We are always looking for a way to bring new news to the drinks market and research shows that the Echo Falls consumer is eager to try out novel and exciting products.

“With the gin market growing at pace, it was a natural choice for us to develop a new product which combines the Echo Falls hugely popular signature flavour, summer berries, whilst simultaneously responding to the overwhelming popularity of gin in the UK.

“The launch of Echo Falls Summer Berries Pink Gin comes just in time for the summer and will target loyal consumers who identify with the fun and positive nature of Echo Falls, but who also like gin. The launch will also have high appeal to those who enjoy trying new, trend led products.”

The new drink has an rrp of £16 and it has already gained listings at Tesco, Bargain Booze and various convenience retailers.

"The Brexit vote has sparked a talent drain that threatens London’s elite status in the global wine trade, according to Liberty Wines managing director...","20 May, 2019",http://cdn744.pressflex.net/images//18714.photo.2.jpg?m=1558353673,http://drinksretailingnews.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/18714/Brexit_poses_threat_to_London_s_elite_status.html,"The Brexit vote has sparked a talent drain that threatens London’s elite status in the global wine trade, according to Liberty Wines managing director David Gleave MW.

“Brexit is a bloody nightmare,” he told DRN. “Personally I am furious. It’s defi nitely the wrong thing for the country. “What worries me is that, anecdotally, there’s a lot of sommeliers who say: ‘I don’t feel welcome here. I am going to go to a diff erent country to work or go back to my country.’ There’s going to be a real shortage of good-quality people in the trade and we are reliant on those people to sell good-quality wine.

“We are having to pour a huge amount of money into training to make up a shortfall.”

Gleave said the Brexit referendum result and the ensuing damage to foreign exchange rates has already affected his firm’s margins. “It has already hit us because of the devaluation of the pound,” he said.

“We had to put prices up, like many others, but we couldn’t recoup anything like the total loss of margin it has cost us. “Our customers have had food infl ation, wine retailers have had wine infl ation, and they have had to re-engineer their ranges, so we couldn’t pass on all our increases.”

Despite the various headwinds, Gleave said Liberty has just enjoyed its strongestever year of trading. “We just keep things simple and give customers very good service,” he said. “We work very hard on consistently bringing in new and interesting wines. We have recently taken on wines from China, India and Israel, and they are good wines. Customers have had costs rising every which way, so we need to be efficient and as seamless as possible.”

He is encouraged by increasing levels of wine education among British consumers, as he feels this can drive growth in premium tiers. “Consumption is declining, and that’s no bad thing,” said Gleave.

“There’s a move towards people drinking better and there are increases in average selling prices in the premium sector, where engaged consumers need interesting wines.

“There’s no use buying any cheap thing, marking it up and taking a high margin. People know more about wine now.”

But he still feels that Brexit is the biggest long-term threat to the wine trade.

“It’s going to have a huge impact on the wine trade for many years,” he said.

“The economy is already smaller today than it would have been. That’s a general consensus.

“Spread that over the next 10-15 years and we will become slightly poorer, making us less attractive to wine producers, and it becomes a downward spiral.That would be a huge pity.

“I have been working in the London trade for 37 years and it has changed hugely for the better, becoming a lot more international. If we lose those people coming over, we will become more insular.

“People say there’s project fear and we haven’t fallen off the edge of a cliff , but that’s because Brexit hasn’t taken place yet. There could be much worse to come if it happens.""

The London Wine Fair is in “an extremely healthy position” in the lead up to next year’s 40th anniversary show, according to head of fair Hannah Tovey.

A total of 13,260 visitors attended the show this year, which was a 7% decrease on last year but a 9% increase on 2017. The drop in visitor numbers was expected as a result of a change in strategy, which involved implementing a charge for some sections of the trade for the first time.

Exhibitor numbers were up this year by 11% compared to 2018. These included importers returning to the show such as Enotria&Coe, Buckingham Schenk, C&C Wines and Felix Solis Avantis.

Hannah Tovey, said: “2019 was all about attracting a high-quality audience which built on last year’s strategy of delivering on higher numbers of visitors and a refreshed show. Our massive visitor increase last year (17% up on 2017) meant that we could more than withstand a fall in numbers this year. Implementing the charging strategy for some visitors also meant we expected a slight drop this year, something which our exhibitors were on board with. All the exhibitors I have spoken to over the last three days have sighted a better quality of visitor at their stand, with a smaller audience actually being better for doing meaningful business.

“We feel that the show is in an extremely healthy position in the lead up to next year’s 40th anniversary. 2020 will be all about delivering a very special edition of the London Wine Fair; the anniversary will be a fantastic opportunity to celebrate the very best of the UK drinks industry and we very much look forward to sharing our plans over the coming months.”

Jon Pepper MW, chief operating officer, Enotria&Coe, said: “We’ve been running masterclasses for 12 different premium producers on our stand. The uptake has been amazing. We’ve had between 300-400 people applying for each of the masterclasses that we’ve done. There have been people queuing off the stand. It’s been a really good cross-section of premium to mid-level on-trade and off-trade. An amazing selection of customers. We’re really delighted with how it has gone.”

The 2020 London Wine Fair will take place at Olympia from May 18 to 20.
