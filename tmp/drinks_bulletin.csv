"Hahn has launched Hahn Ultra Crisp – a full-strength 4.2% ABV, full-flavoured lager that is lower carb, 99% sugar free, preservative free and gluten free.","February 13, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/hahn-gluten-free.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=1&Article=lion-to-release-gluten-free-hahn-ultra-crisp,"Hahn has launched Hahn Ultra Crisp – a full-strength 4.2% ABV, full-flavoured lager that is lower carb, 99% sugar free, preservative free and gluten free.

Created using what Lion describes as ""a ground-breaking multi-million dollar brewing process five years in the making"", the lager is brewed entirely from rice.

Endorsed by Coeliac Australia as gluten free and appropriate for those with coeliac disease, all the ingredients in Hahn Ultra Crisp are also naturally gluten free with additional testing ensuring no traces of gluten are present.

Michelle Laforest, Chief Executive Officer of Coeliac Australia said: “Australians with coeliac disease know they can trust a product to be genuinely gluten free when it is endorsed by Coeliac Australia. We congratulate Hahn for its innovation and for recognising the needs of the gluten free consumer.""

Jeff Potter, Lion’s Brewing Research and Development Director explained that the design of Hahn Ultra Crisp was driven by demand for great tasting beer that meets the evolving needs of Australian beer drinkers.

“There are some beers out there which use rice as part of the grain mix to balance the flavour, but we are the first in Australia to create a beer that is brewed entirely with rice, instead of grains like wheat or barley. The challenge for us was to work out how to make Hahn Ultra Crisp taste great without using the traditional grains which usually produce the flavours of beer as we know it.

“Once we figured that out, it was a matter of creating the perfect combination with aromatic hops and a specially chosen yeast, and the result is a crisp, dry beer with light citrus aromas and a clean finish that holds its own when it comes to flavour,” Potter said.

Amy Darvill, Lion's Brand Director for Classic and Contemporary beers said Hahn was excited to continue evolving to meet the needs of the modern beer drinker, and in doing so launching a product which will be truly incremental to the beer category.

“Just as the low carb beers like Hahn Super Dry did over 12 years ago, Hahn Ultra Crisp will change consumer expectations around beer and bring hundreds of thousands of Australians with a gluten intolerance into the beer category.

“Hahn has always been at the forefront of brewing innovation to create products that consumers want, including Hahn Premium, Hahn Premium Light, Hahn Super Dry and Hahn Super Dry 3.5. As much as we love these brands – they were all launched a long time ago. Our drinkers’ needs have changed, and we need to respond to them.""

Hahn Ultra Crisp is available from February 18 from leading retailers around the country. It will have an RRP from $17/330mL 6-pack and $47/330mL 24-case (plus CDS if applicable).",Lion to release gluten-free Hahn Ultra Crisp
"De Bortoli Wines’ rosé aficionados Leanne De Bortoli and Steve Webber have revealed the inspiration for their new sparkling rosé, La Bohème Cuvée Rosé.","February 14, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/debortoli-sparkling-rose.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=1&Article=toast-valentines-day-with-de-bortoli-la-boheme-cuvee-rose,"De Bortoli Wines’ rosé aficionados Leanne De Bortoli and Steve Webber have revealed the inspiration for their new sparkling rosé, La Bohème Cuvée Rosé.

The pair had long aspired to create a sparkling rosé after enjoying some ‘posh Laurent Perrier Grand Cuvee Rosé’ many years ago.

""It was the best sparkling rosé that we had tried,"" said De Bortoli (pictured below with Webber). ""Since then, I have wanted us to create something similar.""

They believe they’ve cracked the holy grail with the pale, dry La Bohème Cuvée Rosé, which taps into Australia’s growing love affair with all things pink.

The La Bohème wine range is having its biggest year of growth, up 75.3% versus the previous year with all wines in the range in growth.

More recently, the sparkling rosé category is gaining traction ahead of total sparkling (+12.2% vs +6.9% in the latest MAT)*.

According to De Bortoli, La Bohème Cuvée Rosé is kept as pale and dry as possible and blended in batches or cuvées using vintage and reserve wines. This gives consistency to each bottling and enables the introduction of fresher wine over time for ultimate drinkability and complexity.

""Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier shape the wine, with Chardonnay giving the lovely breadiness, Pinot contributing toasty biscuit characteristics and Meunier giving generosity and complexity,"" she added.

De Bortoli said the wine makes the perfect toast on February 14.

""Who doesn’t love delicious pink bubbles to celebrate Valentine’s Day – they are made for each other!”

Forbes agrees, recently declaring: ""Given its colour - ranging from pink to copper to orange to salmon, and every shade in between - rosé Champagne has an allure - it's sexy and sensual, and no wonder it's the Champagne many turn to on Valentine's Day or any other day that romantic thoughts come to mind.""",Toast Valentine's Day with Australia's prettiest new wine

Treasury Wine Estates has revealed it's entering the beer business and negotiating to acquire two French vineyards as it expands its reach in the US and China.,"February 14, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/crimes-twe.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=1&Article=treasury-wine-estates-to-launch-19-crimes-beer-range,"Treasury Wine Estates has revealed it's entering the beer business and negotiating to acquire two French vineyards as it expands its reach in the US and China.

The brewing announcement marks a return to the fold for TWE, which was spun out of Foster’s Group eight years ago.

The hugely popular 19 Crimes wine brand is poised to launch three craft beers in the US in March — an American India pale ale, a pilsner and a lager.

The beers will be tested in Ohio initially and, if successful, will expand to more states in the US.

An 1869 Irish whiskey is also in the works, with a July launch planned.

TWE CEO Michael Clarke noted during an earnings call today that ""the spirits components from 19 Crimes is going to be big and profitable"".

The Irish whiskey segment is booming, with sustained double digit sales growth. The industry had another record year of export growth in 2018 with the value of exports increasing by €45 million to €623 million.

The 19 Crimes label had been the fastest-growing wine brand in the US over the past three years. It's in its sixth year of ""phenomenal growth"" in the US, with dollar sales increasing by over 70% in the past year.

The decision to broaden the brand into beer and spirits was prompted by liquor retailers asking for 19 Cimes to be expanded to include other beverages.

Meanwhile, Clarke revealed that the company is poised to acquire up to two small wineries in France along with premium vineyards to assist in its push into China.

""We're in dialogue with two to three parties,"" Clarke said.

TWE plans to launch a portfolio of three French-made wines, one of which will be branded Penfolds. The other two French wines will be part of the existing Maison de Grand Esprit and a French version of its Californian premium brand Beaulieu Vineyard.

Previously, the Maison de Grand Esprit brand used wine sourced from external vineyards.

""In order to really have a serious platform that we can grow our French portfolio from, we don't want to use other people's infrastructure to do everything,"" Clarke said. ""We want our infrastructure, we want a permanent team on the ground and the beauty is you can also have visiting winemakers, especially from Australia, going to France because it's contra season obviously, for two different vintages.""

Clarke added that the French wine category makes up 30-40% of the total wine market in China and the company is keen to secure a larger piece of the action.

""The French category, in particular, is one where we see huge opportunity to win share,"" he noted.

TWE announced this morning that its net sales revenue is up 16% to $1,507.7million, representing the largest organic growth rate in the company's history. Overall, the Asian region was the standout performer, with EBITS growth up 31% to $153.1 million.

French brand portfolio net sales revenue in Asia was up 111%.

""The fundamentals of the Asian wine market as a whole remain enormously attractive, and we are not seeing a slowdown in demand for our brands,"" Clarke said.

""We also see tremendous opportunity to expand our penetration into more cities and across more partners in China. We have an ambition to expand our presence and availability by more than 50% in the next three years.""",TWE to launch 19 Crimes beer range
Victorian craft brewery Southern Bay has had a social media ad banned by ABAC.,"February 09, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/southern-bay.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=2&Article=southern-bay-tweet-banned-for-breaking-advertising-code,"A Victorian craft brewery's social media post has been banned by ABAC.

The Twitter post by Geelong's Southern Bay Brew Co showed a 1950s style image of a man in a suit drinking a glass of beer with the message “there’s nothing wrong with you that me drinking six beers can’t fix”.

A complaint to the ABAC said “six beers is clearly in excess of responsible drinking practices”.

Southern Bay Brewery said it outsourced its social media to a “contracted media company based in Tasmania” and that the post was intended to be humorous, rather than offering serious advice.

“We do not believe the post suggested that the consumption of six beers suggested it would change the person’s tolerance of another individual,"" the company said. ""We believe the post relates to a more relaxed outlook. It certainly would not contribute to any significant change in behaviour.”

The Australia’s Responsible Alcohol Marketing Code ruled that the tweet implied people should use alcohol to “overcome a deficit” and implied it is acceptable to use excessive alcohol consumption to deal with difficult situations.

However, ABAC ruled that the message did not encourage excessive drinking.

"Pernod Ricard is celebrating its fastest profit growth in seven years for H1 FY19, however there were declines in Australia.","February 11, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/jacob's%20creek%20sparkling.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=2&Article=results-decline-for-pernod-ricard-australia-due-to-new-wine-strategy,"Pernod Ricard is celebrating its fastest profit growth in seven years, with sales for H1 FY19 totalling €5,185million and organic growth of +7.8%.

Pernod Ricard chief executive Alexandre Ricard said: “We had the best first half since 2011. Our performance is accelerating. My priority is to create durable value and I hope this will please all our shareholders.”

While East Asia growth was a stand out, with acceleration of 16% due to 28% growth in China and 24% growth in India, the picture wasn't as rosy in Australia.

""As for Australia, declines are driven by the wine portfolio due to the implementation of our value strategy and some destocking of one of our customers,"" Ricard said. ""Jameson, The Glenlivet, Ballantine's and Kahlúa by the way, are all performing quite strongly.""

The company noted that a decline in the UK was driven by Jacob’s Creek reviewing its approach in UK, turning its focus to higher styles.

However, Ricard said there was ""continued a very strong development in Asia"" for Jacob's Creek, where China and India both saw double-digit growth.

Meanwhile, Brancott Estate suffered a decline driven by Australia and New Zealand, in a ""very competitive environment"".

Ricard also noted: ""Strategic Wines are down 8%, direct consequence of the implementation of our value strategy. We do expect a stronger H2. We have, as you can see, a very strong price and mix, up 4%. Some comparable technical reasons for Campo Viejo to be down 9% over the first half. It was up 23% a year ago.""

The growing apertif market has been a boon for Pernod Ricard, with Lillet up 38% globally and seeing double-digit growth in all regions.

Martell was also a strong performer, up 23%. Drinks Trade's 2019 Hottest 100 Brands recently revealed it was the fastest growing cognac in Australia in 2018, accelerating five times faster than the cognac category.

Jameson was up 8%, while Scotch whiskies were up 9% and Monkey 47 was up 21%.

 Beefeater was up 9%, with all regions performing strongly and good development of Beefeater Pink, particular in the UK. 

 Mumm sales accelerated 2%, driven by Americas and Asia-Rest of World, most notably in the US and China. Meanwhile Perrier-Jouët: was up 12%, with all regions performing strongly.

H1 FY19 was the first semester of Pernod Ricard's new Transform & Accelerate three-year plan.

""Now looking forward, which is what we really like to do in Pernod Ricard, we have clearly worked on a strategic plan, a three year strategic plan called Transform & Accelerate, which is basically aiming at leveraging our successful strategy,"" Ricard noted. ""Remember, our business model, consumer-centric, consumer-obsessed model, driven by a consumer occasions-based obsession with four key fundamentals: operational excellence; talent development; sustainability and responsibility; Route-to-market, route-to-consumer. And our four key accelerators with our portfolio management: premiumisation, luxury, innovation, and finally, digital acceleration.""

Ricard pledged to lift the group operating profit margin by 50 to 60 basis points per year, provided it could deliver annual organic sales growth of 4 to 7%.

He also promised to deliver an additional €100m in cost savings by 2021, after stripping out €200m in the previous three years.

 “My ruthless focus is to deliver this plan, transform and accelerate,” said Ricard. Having the backing of a family shareholder with a long-term vision, “is a huge competitive advantage”.

 When asked whether Pernod Ricard would consider selling off its lower-margin wine or champagne businesses as a way to boost profitability, Ricard said: “We’re going to continue doing bolt-on acquisitions like we’ve done in the recent past . . . and if we believe some brands no longer have a real strategic value, we will sell them.”

Pernod Ricard looks to China and India for future growth

Ricard revealed that the company expects middle and affluent consumers in China to grow by roughly 100 million by 2021.

""We have that ambition as industry leaders in China to double the industry penetration rate by 2025,"" he said. ""We have a leadership position in China, with roughly 45% market share and a second-to-none route-to-market. We said it three and half years ago, when China was in double-digit decline, it is a market that can sustainably grow high single, low double.""

As for India, Ricard said: ""Well, the legal drinking age population is increasing by roughly 20 million a year. In addition to that, urbanization's rates, which is exactly where we operate in India, are accelerating. And in addition to that, GDP is growing 6%, 7%. So these three key elements lead us to believe as well, as we said it three years ago, that India can grow sustainably low double digit. There'll be better years, there'll be worse years, but overall, the dynamics are there.""

Globally, Ricard is thinking big. He said: ""In 2018, for the first time in human history, the middle-class population now represents more than half of the total world population. We expect an additional two billion middle-class people by the end of 2030, globally. Our current growth engines in terms of the major emerging middle class are China, India and Eastern Europe. Our medium-term growth engines from a middle-class point of view, which will accumulate with China, India and Eastern Europe, are Latin America, specifically, Brazil, Mexico and some Southeastern Asian market. And our very long-term growth engine will be Sub-Saharan Africa. We're investing there for the very long term. It's a 15-year view.""","Wine down, whiskey up for Pernod Ricard Australia"

The big night was held at the Museum of Contemporary Art to coincide with Founders Day – a date that celebrates the legacy and fearless journey of our Bacardi family over the last 157 years.

Hemsworth’s drink, The Monarch, was judged not only on its ingredients and methods used to create a cocktail for the ages, but also her expertise in promoting the drink to the public.

In the end, Hemsworth’s inspired use of BACARDÍ Carta Blanca coupled with a flair for promotion both on and off stage won the judges over.

Hemsworth - who is based at Sydney’s Restaurant Hubert - is now looking forward to representing Australia on the global stage in Amsterdam in May. She's won an all-expenses-paid journey to compete against the best bartenders from 48 countries globally, and potentially etch her country’s name into the bartending history books.

BACARDÍ Brand Ambassador Loy Catada (above) said of the evening, “Seeing the four competitors going head to head under such high pressure is truly inspiring. Their passion for creating a legacy of their own shone brightly, and the judges had their work cut out for them picking a winner.”

Guest of honour was the talented alchemist behind the label, former Penfolds winemaker Mike Farmilo (pictured above).

Farmilo, who has more than 40 years’ industry experience and has twice been awarded the prestigious Jimmy Watson Trophy, was a wonderful host, proudly presenting the four Italian and Spanish varietals that have been grown and made in South Australia’s Fleurieu Peninsula.

Drinks Bulletin was fascinated to discuss the range with the down-to-earth winemaker.

“The Fleurieu Peninsula is surrounded by water, with the Southern Ocean on one side and the Gulf St Vincent on the other, so it’s the Australian region with the closest climate to the Mediterranean,” he explained. 

 Farmilo believes the Fleurieu has the best conditions to grow the finest alternative varietals in South Australia.

 “These wines show the character and style of their home countries,' he said. ""They have bright fruit characters with minimal oak, and are made to be enjoyed fresh.”

Set in Sydney's Surry Hills, Pasta Emilia is a traditional and organic Italian restaurant featuring a menu of pastas, roast meat and fish.

According to Christine Ricketts, Cellar Director for wine retailer Cellarmasters, the Altero wines are the perfect pairings for food.

“These are elegant wines with a lovely balance and layered structured,"" she said. ""Although they have fruit flavours, these wines have more savoury notes, like traditional Italian and European wines.""

The wines are available exclusively through Cellarmasters for $14.99 per bottle (in case).",Former Penfolds winemaker releases Mediterranean-style range
A beer delivery is among the casualties as truckies are stranded in North Queensland during flooding.,"February 06, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/creek-walkabout.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=3&Article=beer-truckies-stranded-in-flooded-queensland,"A beer truck has been stranded in Longreach as heavy rain continues to fall in North Queensland.

Truckie Michael Patch was heading to Darwin earlier this week with his precious cargo when flooded roads prevented him from travelling north.

He told ABC News it’s likely the beer will be stuck there for a week or more.

“They’ll be all thirsty up there,” he said.

About 25 trucks are delayed in the Queensland town, as flooded roads prevent them from travelling north. Meanwhile, hundreds of truckies were stranded at Charters Towers after the Burdekin River burst its banks.

In some towns there has been a silver-lining to the situation, with Woolies and Coles donating stranded perishables to hungry locals. Walkabout Creek Hotel publican said Frank Wust told The North Queensland Register: “The Woolies and Coles trucks were going to Darwin and they reckoned the food would be out of date before they got there now, and they would have had to write it off.

“There’s packaged steak, chicken pieces, you name it – it’s just like everything you’d see on the shelves in a supermarket.”

Ironically, however, the pub’s beer resupply truck was stranded at Winton.

“We’ll just drink something else when the beer runs out,” Wurst said.

Coles chartered a plane to Cairns on Sunday to bring supplies to the region.

A Coles spokeswoman told the Cairns Post half the load would be trucked to Townsville on “recently reopened roads”.

“We are also investigating alternative delivery routes with trucks from Adelaide and Darwin on the roads to deliver to other flood-impacted areas of Far North Queensland,” they added.

The one-in-100-year weather event is far from over with the Bureau of Meteorology warning more heavy rain is likely from Palm Island, north of Townsville, south to Mackay today.

Woolworths had five delivery trucks en route to Cairns parked in Ingham over the weekend waiting for tidal flooding to subside.

“Road situations have been challenging and we are looking at every avenue possible to get stock into our stores …” Woolworths Northern Queensland operations manager Tina Anandji said.

It secured a barge in Mackay and fillled it with 300 tonnes of groceries while also chartering two planes.

Both supermarkets are expected to charter more planes over the next few days to ensure supplies to affected towns.

The campaign includes posters on train station platforms that detail the journey of the man who inspired the beer, supported by digital out-of-home and social.

John Boston landed on Australian shores more than 200 years ago and crafted Australia’s first beer in 1796 using corn, bittered with love-apple stalks. But, when it failed the taste test of local guards in Old Sydney Town, Boston jumped ship to America. Sadly, he never made it, as he was eaten by cannibals somewhere in the South Pacific.

M&C Saatchi chief creative officer Cam Blackley said the campaign is about celebrating a legend and the quality beer,"" he explained.

“John Boston’s story is about as outrageous as it is unknown. We know that he was among the first brewers in Australia and that his original beer was eye-wateringly bad.

“In fact, we know that the man failed at everything he did except dying in an incredibly interesting way. But he had this quality that is hard not to admire – he got back up and tried again every single time. This campaign is about celebrating a legend and the quality beer that remembers his gumption.”

Rachel Hofman, marketing manager at Pinnacle Drinks, added: “The result is a compelling brand platform which fully embraces John Boston’s cheeky, tell-it-how-it-is tone of voice to share the brand story, delivering visually impactful tailored messages on targeted platforms.

Inspired by Bonner's grandfather's recipes for poitin – a spirit made from potatoes – the pair (pictured below) have founded their premium potato-based craft spirits company in Muff, a small village in Donegal.

The distiller's name has attracted a lot of attention on social media, with Bonner admitting the hype is helping the product to stand out.

She explained that while the name represents the “fun and cheeky” identity the pair want to establish, the product itself is a serious contender.

The Muff has already won Gold in the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America Exposition in Las Vegas and Gold in the Asia Gin Masters in Hong Kong.

“The awards have been hugely important to us,"" Bonner told Derry Now. ""We are also delighted to be part of the development of the Irish drinks scene and to have benefitted from the positive attitude and support that is out there for female entrepreneurs. We couldn’t have achieved the success without the support of the local community and local businesses who have really got behind us in showcasing our products.”

Over the next 12 months Bonner and Russell plan to further develop distribution in South East Asia and Australia, China, Hong Kong and Japan.

“We have been overwhelmed with our success to date and the response to our products and the interest in Muff Vodka has been particularly high,"" Russell said. ""It really builds on our unique taste and brand and creates a special and personal vibe. 2018 has been a fantastic year and we are really confident that 2019 and the years ahead will be positive for us. We will be keeping our heads down and remain focused to achieve our goal of global domination! We are very much committed to further developing our plans for our own distillery and creating jobs in our area but most of all we hope that our customers will continue to support us and enjoy our unique products.”

Treasury Wine Estates' Asia and Global Travel Retail MD Peter Dixon has moved to Accolade Wines.,"February 18, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/penfolds-baijui-2.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=1&Article=treasury-wine-estates-peter-dixon-moves-to-accolade-wines,"Treasury Wine Estates' Asia and Global Travel Retail MD Peter Dixon has moved to rival Accolade Wines.

Dixon has been with TWE since 2008 and moved into his current role in early 2017, following his predecessor Robert Foye being appointed global COO. Foye left the company last month following a breach of the company's internal code of conduct policies.

Dixon will be replaced by Tom King, who moved to Shanghai last year to become chief operating officer of TWE's Asian operations. King was previously managing director of TWE's European operations.

""Peter Dixon has decided to depart the company to pursue other career opportunities and the company thanks Peter for his contribution,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement. ""The fundamentals of the TWE business in Asia remain unchanged, the Company has a strong leadership team in place, and remains committed to its growth plans with its partners"".

Dixon's new employer will be The Carlyle Group, which bought Accolade Wines from CHAMP Private Equity and Constellation Brands in 2018 for about $1 billion. He will assume a leadership role within the company.

Dixon noted on WeChat: “Many people have already heard that I will be leaving TWE shortly. I just want to personally thank all the amazing partners I’ve worked with over the past 10 years in Asia and specifically all the support from the China partners in the last five years.

""I am excited by the opportunities to be in a humble new business with amazing quality wines, which I hope everyone has the opportunity to try shortly! Also a huge thanks to my amazing team at TWE for all they have done and I wish everyone good fortune for the future.""

TWE CEO Michael Clarke revealed during an earnings call last week how the company's unique wholesale model in China gives it an advantage over other wine importers.

TWE defied the Chinese economic slowdown to report Asian EBITS growth up 31% to $153.1 million in its HY19 results.

""As many of you will know, in China, we use a wholesale model where we are the distributor,"" he said. ""Unlike our competitors, we do not rely on a third-party distributor to sell our brands and, therefore, we do not incur the approximately 50% distributor margin.

""Instead, we partner with retailers, wholesalers and state-owned enterprises, and we actively manage those relationships directly, making decisions on how and where our brands are sold, with specific portfolio and channel strategies.""

He explained how the model offered a number of significant benefits, driving value for TWE, its customers and the consumer.

""By self-distributing we operate a more efficient value chain, which means we can deliver a lower price on-shelf and use the margin liberated from not paying a distributor margin to invest more actively behind our brands and drive consumer pull-through over time,"" he said.

He also revealed that TWE's imported value share is around double that of its sell-through value share.

""For example, in a recent period, our imported value share was around 8%,"" he said. ""However, our sell-through value share was closer to 4%. What this difference demonstrates is the efficiency of our model versus our competitors'. Our competitors incur distributor margins, negociants margins, additional duties that we do not incur, which ultimately result in higher retail prices for our competitors because they have more mouths to feed in their value chain.""

Clarke said the wholesale model also enabled TWE to have a deeper understanding of what's happening in the Chinese market, including visibility on customer performance and inventory levels.

""Being closer to the customer positions us to be able to react more readily than our competitors,"" he said.

Looking to the future, Clarke said TWE saw tremendous opportunity to expand its penetration into more cities and across more partners in China.

""We have an ambition to expand our presence and availability by more than 50% in the next three years, and we will achieve this through increased allocations of luxury wine in future periods,"" he said.

""We are the largest wine importer into China. But even after growing our share by over 30% in the last 12 months, we still currently only have a sub-5% market share.""

TWE will also expand the quantities going through its new warehouse in Shanghai and plans to build more warehouses throughout China.

""We're probably looking at three warehouses over time in China, North, Southeast or East and South,"" Clarke revealed.

TWE sees its French labels as being key to winning share. French wine is the largest import category in China, accounting for approximately 30% to 40% of the market.

The company is preparing to launch a French Penfold's wine, plus one through its US Beaulieu Vineyards label and and is also looking at expanding its French label, Maison de Grand Esprit.

""We are confident we can take share in this segment by putting more French wine through our competitively advantaged business model,"" he said.

""The fundamentals of the Asian wine market as a whole remain enormously attractive, and we are not seeing a slowdown in demand for our brands,"" he concluded.",TWE's Peter Dixon heads to Accolade Wines
Peter Lehmann Wines has released a new shiraz that pays tribute to the historic moment the winemaker saved Barossa Valley grape growers.,"February 19, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/lehmann-historic.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=1&Article=peter-lehmann-celebrates-40th-anniversary-with-the-bond-shiraz,"Peter Lehmann Wines is celebrating its 40th anniversary with a new shiraz that pays tribute to a promise the winemaker made to Barossa Valley grape growers.

‘The Bond’ Shiraz has been created to honour the promise Peter Lehmann made to Barossa winemakers and grape growers In the lead-up to the 1979 vintage.

The Barossa had experienced a large fruit surplus that threatened the livelihood of many grape growing families in the region, as they were unable to sell their produce. Understanding that these hard times could compromise the region’s future, Lehmann established his own winery. He took the surplus fruit from the growers, and with a handshake and his word as his bond, promised to repay them once he had starting making wine.

“The Bond is in honour of our winery’s founder Peter Lehmann - a fifth generation Barossan man who was as passionate about his community as he was of the craft of winemaking,” said Tim Dolan, Peter Lehmann Wines Senior Winemaker.

“Our winery and the bourgeoning Barossan region would exist today if it wasn’t for Peter’s courage and commitment back in the late 1970s. We are privileged to continue Peter’s strong relationships with over 140 growers across the region, who provide us with the Barossa’s finest grapes, including some of the greatest and oldest Shiraz in the world.”

Caroline Wood, Senior Brand Manager, Premium Wines – Marketing at Casella Family Brands said Peter Lehmann Wines’ rich history and winemaking expertise makes The Bond a wonderful addition to its stable of premium wines.

“The Bond is an evolved style of Barossa Shiraz that appeals to the modern consumer’s palate while still maintaining Peter Lehmann Wines’ hallmark consistency and quality,” Wood noted.

“Shiraz is the largest varietal by nearly 40% in both value and volume in the total red wine segment in Australia. The Bond sits in the $20-25 price segment which is growing at nearly 7% vs YA in value, as Australian consumers continue to premiumise their wine purchases from cheaper segments.""

The Bond is available now across Australia as an exclusive for independent retailers with a RRP of $24.95.",Peter Lehmann celebrates Barossa bond with special release

"Highlights for Coles Liquor stores in their half-year 2019 results were an increase in basket size, continuing premiumisation and overall spirit category growth.","February 19, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/coles-cheap-Collage.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=1&Article=coles-liquor-sales-revenue-rises-in-half-year-2019-results,"The first half of the 2019 financial year has has delivered flat sales for Coles Liquor.

Sales revenue for the segment was $1.7 billion, an increase of 0.6% on the prior corresponding period.

Overall, Coles' net profit fell 29.4% to $381 million in HY19, due to $146 million in supply chain restructuring charges.The charges relate to Coles' plans to build two new automated warehouses and close smaller distribution centres.

Supermarket earnings fell 26.7% to $441 million despite a 3.6% increase in sales to $16.2 billion (on a retail calendar basis).

Coles Group CEO Steven Cain said the result for the first half of the 2019 financial year was a solid outcome in a challenging retail environment, and Coles was now laying the foundations for long term growth – including a $950 million investment in supply chain automation and the New Alliance Agreement between Coles Express and Viva Energy.

“We have delivered strong cash generation and we have a robust balance sheet which will enable us to reposition the business in the years ahead,"" Cain said.

Coles Liquor's comparable sales growth was flat due to the impact of New Year's Eve, typically a strong trading day in the liquor calendar, which fell in the third quarter of this financial year compared to the second quarter last year.

NYE adjusted comparable sales growth was 1% for the half and 0.7% for the second quarter.

Trading in the second quarter was impacted by unfavourable weather relative to the prior year, which impacted transaction growth particularly in beer and ready-to-drink (RTD) categories.

The company noted that transaction growth accelerated in December across all brands, particularly over the key Christmas period.

Average basket size continued to increase across the period, driven by general market trends of premiumisation and a favourable mix impact from overall spirit category growth.

There was also online sales growth of 30%, with 70% of online orders now fulfilled via Click & Collect.

Gross margin for Coles Liquor increased by 9bps to 28.3% primarily due to margin improvements from ""exclusive brand expansion and improved supplier collaboration"".

During the half, more than 50 new exclusive lines were launched, including a number of award-winning products.

In November, Coles private label wine Story Bay Semillon Sauvignon Blanc 2017, priced at just $7 a bottle, beat a field of 2500 wines to win best wine under $20 at the Winestate Wine of the Year Awards.

Nocturne has made exclusive wines for Coles Liquor since 2012, was responsible for creating the winning wine.

Coles acting chief executive liquor and hotels Cathi Scarce said: To have this recognition from some of the industry’s top wine tasters is further evidence that we’re getting it right by working with the best winemakers in Australia to deliver amazing quality wines at a great price.”

Last year, the company revealed that, across the board, it wants 40% of its products to be homebrand by 2023.

Liquorland continued to be the strongest performer during the period. Coles noted that this was achieved through a continued focus on improving range, innovation through exclusive brands - particularly in the wine category - and provision of more convenient solutions to customers through Click & Collect and same-day and next-day delivery.

The First Choice format continued to evolve with 15 First Choice Liquor Market brand conversions completed during the period. Coles said that conversions were driving trading improvements, with customers responding positively to the refreshed format and offer.

Trading conditions for Vintage Cellars remained challenging during the half, with a store closure also impacting the result.

Investment in the store network continued in the half with 14 Liquorland renewals in the next evolution format. During the period, 16 new stores were opened and seven closed, resulting in a total of 908 retail liquor sites at end of the half.",Coles Liquor sales revenue hits $1.7 billion
"Coca-Cola Amatil is celebrating another year of double-digit EBIT growth for Alcohol & Coffee, despite the continuing impact of container deposit schemes.","February 21, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/canadian-club-Collage-2.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=1&Article=alcohol-and-coffee-delivers-double-digit-growth-for-coca-cola-amatil,"Coca-Cola Amatil is celebrating another year of double-digit EBIT growth for Alcohol & Coffee in 2018, bucking the continuing impact of container deposit schemes on the company.

Alcohol achieved volume growth, high single-digit revenue growth and another year of double digit EBIT growth for the year. Spirits and premix grew ahead of market. Paradise Beverages continued to grow sales. Coffee grew revenue and volume for the year with positive drivers including coffee bean products and sales in grocery. EBIT performance reflected investment in international opportunities including in Indonesia. A new high value premium brand, SoCo Coffee Roasters, was also launched during the year.

Revenue for Alcohol & Coffee was up 8% to $609.8million in 2018, with underlying EBIT at $55.7million, up 12.1%.

Coca-Cola Amatil said the result was driven by strong performance in the spirits and premix segment, driven by Canadian Club, Maker's Mark and Roku Gin.

Group Managing Director Alison Watkins noted: ""Alcohol & Coffee achieved another year of double-digit EBIT growth while also funding investment in initiatives for our growth aspirations.""

Coca-Cola Amatil's full-year results for 2018 delivered underlying earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) from continuing operations of $634.5 million and underlying net profit after tax (NPAT) from continuing operations of $388.3 million.

The 37.3% slump in full-year net profit was driven by $150 million in impairments due to the soon-to-be-sold SPC business, a loss of in earnings in the soft drinks arm and worsening trading from its Indonesian drinks operations.

Watkins said 2018 was a transition year for the group with earnings impacted by planned investment in the Accelerated Australian Growth Plan, the introduction of container deposit schemes, economic factors in Indonesia and operational challenges in PNG.

“We saw a strong year for the New Zealand, Fiji and Alcohol & Coffee businesses, while there are also positive signs for Australian Beverages with volume growth in Coca-Cola Trademark beverages in the second half.

“Despite the segment result there are also encouraging signs in Indonesia with volume growth over the last nine months of the year. However, as previously reported the Indonesian result was affected by soft market conditions, a weak currency and higher commodity prices. The business is strongly leveraged to capture future growth.”

Australian Beverages’ volume share increased for the year, in both sparkling and still beverages.

Watkins said there was volume growth for Coca-Cola Trademark in the second half led by the continued success of Coca-Cola No Sugar. Low- and no-sugar cola achieved low-single digit volume growth for the year, accelerating in the second half. There was also strong volume growth in dairy and energy throughout the year.

“We continued to see consumer movement towards low- and no-sugar choices. With the success of Coca-Cola No Sugar and low-or no-sugar options in all other major brands, we are well placed to capitalise on this trend,” Watkins said.

“We delivered volume share gains in the water category for the year. However, water volume declined in the second half following changes to promotional strategies with major customers.”

Watkins said the outlook for 2019 remained consistent with what had been presented previously.

“2019 will be the second year of a two-year transition phase for the Group,” she said.

“In Australian Beverages, we will be positioned for growth in 2020, with the completion of the additional $10 million of investment in our Accelerated Australian Growth Plan to increase our salesforce and, with container deposit schemes in NSW and Queensland substantially embedded by the end of 2019.

“Our New Zealand & Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Alcohol & Coffee businesses are expected to again deliver growth in line with our Shareholder Value Proposition.”

“For the Corporate & Services segment, we expect an EBIT loss of $10 to $12 million for FY19 in line with the outlook provided in November 2018, due to lower property rental and services earnings, increased Group capability and investment in IT platforms.”

“The Amatil Group is targeting a return to mid-single digit EPS growth from 2020, in line with our shareholder value proposition. Our level of performance depends on the success of revenue initiatives in Australia, Indonesian economic factors and regulatory conditions in each of our markets.”",Alcohol & Coffee delivers double-digit growth for Coca-Cola Amatil

According to De Bortoli, La Bohème Cuvée Rosé is kept as pale and dry as possible and blended in batches or cuvées using vintage and reserve wines. This gives consistency to each bottling and enables the introduction of fresher wine over time for ultimate drinkability and complexity.

Treasury Wine Estates has revealed it's entering the beer business and negotiating to acquire two French vineyards as it expands its reach in the US and China.,"February 14, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/crimes-twe.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=2&Article=treasury-wine-estates-to-launch-19-crimes-beer-range,"Treasury Wine Estates has revealed it's entering the beer business and negotiating to acquire two French vineyards as it expands its reach in the US and China.

The brewing announcement marks a return to the fold for TWE, which was spun out of Foster’s Group eight years ago.

The hugely popular 19 Crimes wine brand is poised to launch three craft beers in the US in March — an American India pale ale, a pilsner and a lager.

The beers will be tested in Ohio initially and, if successful, will expand to more states in the US.

An 1869 Irish whiskey is also in the works, with a July launch planned.

TWE CEO Michael Clarke noted during an earnings call today that ""the spirits components from 19 Crimes is going to be big and profitable"".

The Irish whiskey segment is booming, with sustained double digit sales growth. The industry had another record year of export growth in 2018 with the value of exports increasing by €45 million to €623 million.

The 19 Crimes label had been the fastest-growing wine brand in the US over the past three years. It's in its sixth year of ""phenomenal growth"" in the US, with dollar sales increasing by over 70% in the past year.

The decision to broaden the brand into beer and spirits was prompted by liquor retailers asking for 19 Cimes to be expanded to include other beverages.

Meanwhile, Clarke revealed that the company is poised to acquire up to two small wineries in France along with premium vineyards to assist in its push into China.

""We're in dialogue with two to three parties,"" Clarke said.

TWE plans to launch a portfolio of three French-made wines, one of which will be branded Penfolds. The other two French wines will be part of the existing Maison de Grand Esprit and a French version of its Californian premium brand Beaulieu Vineyard.

Previously, the Maison de Grand Esprit brand used wine sourced from external vineyards.

""In order to really have a serious platform that we can grow our French portfolio from, we don't want to use other people's infrastructure to do everything,"" Clarke said. ""We want our infrastructure, we want a permanent team on the ground and the beauty is you can also have visiting winemakers, especially from Australia, going to France because it's contra season obviously, for two different vintages.""

Clarke added that the French wine category makes up 30-40% of the total wine market in China and the company is keen to secure a larger piece of the action.

""The French category, in particular, is one where we see huge opportunity to win share,"" he noted.

TWE announced this morning that its net sales revenue is up 16% to $1,507.7million, representing the largest organic growth rate in the company's history. Overall, the Asian region was the standout performer, with EBITS growth up 31% to $153.1 million.

French brand portfolio net sales revenue in Asia was up 111%.

""The fundamentals of the Asian wine market as a whole remain enormously attractive, and we are not seeing a slowdown in demand for our brands,"" Clarke said.

""We also see tremendous opportunity to expand our penetration into more cities and across more partners in China. We have an ambition to expand our presence and availability by more than 50% in the next three years.""",TWE to launch 19 Crimes beer range

The company was established in February 2017 by entrepreneur Laura Bonner and her business partner Tom Russell. Inspired by Bonner's grandfather's recipes for poitin – a spirit made from potatoes – the pair (pictured below) have founded their premium potato-based craft spirits company in Muff, a small village in Donegal.

The distiller's name has attracted a lot of attention on social media, with Bonner admitting the hype is helping the product to stand out.

She explained that while the name represents the “fun and cheeky” identity the pair want to establish, the product itself is a serious contender.

The Muff has already won Gold in the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America Exposition in Las Vegas and Gold in the Asia Gin Masters in Hong Kong.

“The awards have been hugely important to us,"" Bonner told Derry Now. ""We are also delighted to be part of the development of the Irish drinks scene and to have benefitted from the positive attitude and support that is out there for female entrepreneurs. We couldn’t have achieved the success without the support of the local community and local businesses who have really got behind us in showcasing our products.”

Over the next 12 months Bonner and Russell plan to further develop distribution in South East Asia and Australia, China, Hong Kong and Japan.

“We have been overwhelmed with our success to date and the response to our products and the interest in Muff Vodka has been particularly high,"" Russell said. ""It really builds on our unique taste and brand and creates a special and personal vibe. 2018 has been a fantastic year and we are really confident that 2019 and the years ahead will be positive for us. We will be keeping our heads down and remain focused to achieve our goal of global domination! We are very much committed to further developing our plans for our own distillery and creating jobs in our area but most of all we hope that our customers will continue to support us and enjoy our unique products.”

Jeff Potter, Lion’s Brewing Research and Development Director explained that the design of Hahn Ultra Crisp was driven by demand for great tasting beer that meets the evolving needs of Australian beer drinkers.

“There are some beers out there which use rice as part of the grain mix to balance the flavour, but we are the first in Australia to create a beer that is brewed entirely with rice, instead of grains like wheat or barley. The challenge for us was to work out how to make Hahn Ultra Crisp taste great without using the traditional grains which usually produce the flavours of beer as we know it.

“Once we figured that out, it was a matter of creating the perfect combination with aromatic hops and a specially chosen yeast, and the result is a crisp, dry beer with light citrus aromas and a clean finish that holds its own when it comes to flavour,” Potter said.

Amy Darvill, Lion's Brand Director for Classic and Contemporary beers said Hahn was excited to continue evolving to meet the needs of the modern beer drinker, and in doing so launching a product which will be truly incremental to the beer category.

“Just as the low carb beers like Hahn Super Dry did over 12 years ago, Hahn Ultra Crisp will change consumer expectations around beer and bring hundreds of thousands of Australians with a gluten intolerance into the beer category.

“Hahn has always been at the forefront of brewing innovation to create products that consumers want, including Hahn Premium, Hahn Premium Light, Hahn Super Dry and Hahn Super Dry 3.5. As much as we love these brands – they were all launched a long time ago. Our drinkers’ needs have changed, and we need to respond to them.""

Hahn Ultra Crisp is available from February 18 from leading retailers around the country. It will have an RRP from $17/330mL 6-pack and $47/330mL 24-case (plus CDS if applicable).",Lion to release gluten-free Hahn Ultra Crisp

"The cheeky alternative to ‘dry’ charity months such as FebFast and Dry July, Bars March, is back in 2019 and launching in Victoria and Queensland.","February 25, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/bars-march-2.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=1&Article=bars-march-fundraiser-heads-interstate-in-2019,"The cheeky alternative to ‘dry’ charity months such as FebFast and Dry July, Bars March, is back in 2019 and launching in Victoria and Queensland.

The month-long celebration of bar culture in support of animal welfare was launched in 2010 by Sun-Herald social columnist Amy Cooper. Cooper was worried about the all months in the calendar the people were absent from their favourite watering holes.

She felt that doing good didn’t always have to mean deprivation and decided to redress the balance with a charity month devoted to encouraging responsible drinkers back out on the town.

The aim: to celebrate the talent, creativity and originality that personify Sydney’s bar scene, while raising money for animals - who bring to our lives even more pleasure than our favourite bars and drinks.

Nine years on, Bars March has evolved into an annual month-long party and favourite event on Sydney’s social calendar. It has been supported by more than 400 bars and raised $80,000 for Animal Welfare League NSW.

During the month of March special cocktails will once again be sold by bars in Sydney and Wollongong to raise funds, while Melbourne, Byron Bay and Toowoomba have been added to the mix this year – with venues ranging from craft cocktail bars to big lively pubs, urban breweries and distilleries.

The first bar to sign up in Melbourne is Port Melbourne’s dog-friendly whisky bar The Tipsy Cow, owned by dog lover and vet Anupam Sharma.

The multi-awarded Loch and Key, upstairs at Melbourne’s oldest pub, The Captain Melville has also come aboard with their canine regular Tofu set to make a star appearance during BARS MARCH. And fellow acclaimed CBD haunt Golden Monkey also joins the fun.

In Sydney, the doggone good celebrations will kick off at Surry Hills' new dog-friendly hotspot Caffe Bartolo (owned by dog-loving bar guru Jared Merlino) with a three-day $10 brunch cocktail special from Friday 1 March to Sunday 3 March.

Meanwhile in the inner west, dog-friendly ‘The Erko’ - AKA Erskineville Hotel - will start the month with a Paws for a Pint dog party on Saturday, March 2.

In Toowoomba, Bar Wunder will be staging celebrations in their dog-devoted beer garden that sells doggy beer and dog treats.

Balcony Bar & Oyster Co. will fly the flag up in Byron Bay, while Wollongong is proudly represented by the dog-friendly North Wollongong Hotel for the second year running.

Some firm favourites are also back in Sydney, including top fundraiser for the last two years running, O Bar Dining. This Sydney CBD venue raised $3508 for Animal Welfare League NSW in 2018, selling 1754 Unleashed cocktails over the month.

Sydney’s other participating venues for 2019 include The Commodore (Milsons Point), The Rio (Summer Hill) The Carrington (Surry Hills), Frisco Hotel (Woolloomooloo); Kittyhawk (CBD), The Lobo Plantation (CBD), The Swinging Cat (CBD), East Village Sydney (Darlinghurst), Big Poppa’s (Darlinghurst), Watsons Bay Hotel, (Watson’s Bay) and The Royal Leichhardt (Leichhardt).

In another first for 2019, Bars March will be supported by dog-loving Tito’s Handmade Vodka. With a slogan ‘vodka for dog people,’ the US craft spirit is a dedicated supporter of its local animal shelters and the distillery is home to various rescue dogs. Bars March charity fundraising cocktails in select bars will feature Tito’s Handmade Vodka.

Celebrity ambassadors for Bars March include TV vet Dr Katrina Warren, garden guru Jamie Durie and a squad of four-legged Instagram stars – the Kardashians of the canine world. They’ll all be out and about at the bars during March.

“Our other key mission is to showcase the creativity, talent and hard work that makes the Australian bar scene truly world class,"" Cooper explained. ""While our ‘why’ is helping animals, we’re also a hearty cheer squad for the hardworking people who drive the hospitality industry. Put simply, we love bars, and we want to spread that love.”

During Bars March you can show your support by visiting participating venues and buying a Bars March charity cocktail, attending fundraising events and taking part in social media competitions.",Bars March fundraiser heads interstate in 2019
Starward held a remarkable tasting event Cunard's Queen Elizabeth this week to celebrate its new Seafarer whisky.,"February 22, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/IMG_9728%20(1).jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=1&Article=starward-launches-whisky-matured-aboard-cunards-queen-elizabeth,"Starward held a remarkable tasting event Cunard's Queen Elizabeth this week to celebrate its new Seafarer whisky.

The distiller filled two identical Australian shiraz oak barrels with whisky last year and bolted one to the deck of the Queen Elizabeth to sail 95,000 nautical miles around the globe, while the other stayed at its Melbourne base.

A lucky group of drinks media and whisky aficionados, including Drinks Bulletin and Drinks Trade, were aboard to sample both whiskies and it was remarkable to taste the distinct differences between them.

The product of a special partnership between Cunard and Starward, designed to celebrate Queen Elizabeth’s inaugural homeporting season in Australia this year, the single malt whisky has experienced temperatures ranging from zero to 32 degrees centigrade as it travelled the world, moving with the motion of the ocean and soaking up the salt of the sea air on its epic journey.

The whisky spent 160 days at sea and a further 187 days visiting more than 90 beautiful ports Clearly weathered by its journey, the now-grey barrel was offloaded in Melbourne on February 10 this year and returned to the distillery.

There Starward founder David Vitale assessed the final whisky, comparing it to a control barrel of the same drop which had remained in Starward’s distillery.

The result is a whisky like no other, according to Vitale.

“The maturation environment is crucial to the final flavour of any whisky so this was an amazing opportunity to create something different,"" he said. ""There’s no doubt The Seafarer’s odyssey on Queen Elizabeth has resulted in a unique whisky, which clearly has a great story to tell through its flavours,” he said. “Even if we put a barrel of the same whisky on another ship for a year, we could never emulate the same weather conditions, so this really is a one-of-a-kind drop.

“While The Seafarer still has Starward’s trademark fruit characters, the oak influences are stronger, our jammy characteristics have developed with time and the dessert cooking spices like vanillin are more identifiable.

“This is a whisky that’s been on an amazing journey so the result is appropriately epic. It’s a special drop so we’re recommending that it should be drunk neat or with a dash of water, so the subtleties of its flavour can be savoured.”

Seafarer has an aroma of marzipan, apricot, currants, red apple, and baked spices; and a warming palate with French oak spice and mildly salted berries.

It also has a lower alcohol content than its sister whisky following its time at sea, giving it a more mellow nose and flavour. This is the first time a Starward whisky has lost alcohol percentage in barrel.

The whisky is now available to guests on board the 2081-guest Queen Elizabeth as well as visitors to Starward's Port Melbourne distillery.

The cruise line’s Australian partnerships mark Queen Elizabeth’s first season based in Australia, with her 54-day deployment stretching over February and March this year. The ship will return in December for a 101-day season over the 2019-20 summer, and again in November 2020 for an unparalleled 118-day deployment.

At 90,900 tonnes, Queen Elizabeth is the second largest ship ever to sail in Cunard’s fleet. Launched in 2010, she is also the youngest in the luxury cruise line’s current trio of Queens with features including more than 10 restaurants and cafés, a Games Deck featuring paddle tennis, croquet and bowls, a two-storey library, a ballroom and the three-deck Royal Court Theatre seating 800 guests and offering private boxes.

"Coca-Cola Amatil is celebrating another year of double-digit EBIT growth for Alcohol & Coffee, despite the continuing impact of container deposit schemes.","February 21, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/canadian-club-Collage-2.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=2&Article=alcohol-and-coffee-delivers-double-digit-growth-for-coca-cola-amatil,"Coca-Cola Amatil is celebrating another year of double-digit EBIT growth for Alcohol & Coffee in 2018, bucking the continuing impact of container deposit schemes on the company.

Alcohol achieved volume growth, high single-digit revenue growth and another year of double digit EBIT growth for the year. Spirits and premix grew ahead of market. Paradise Beverages continued to grow sales. Coffee grew revenue and volume for the year with positive drivers including coffee bean products and sales in grocery. EBIT performance reflected investment in international opportunities including in Indonesia. A new high value premium brand, SoCo Coffee Roasters, was also launched during the year.

Revenue for Alcohol & Coffee was up 8% to $609.8million in 2018, with underlying EBIT at $55.7million, up 12.1%.

Coca-Cola Amatil said the result was driven by strong performance in the spirits and premix segment, driven by Canadian Club, Maker's Mark and Roku Gin.

Group Managing Director Alison Watkins noted: ""Alcohol & Coffee achieved another year of double-digit EBIT growth while also funding investment in initiatives for our growth aspirations.""

Coca-Cola Amatil's full-year results for 2018 delivered underlying earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) from continuing operations of $634.5 million and underlying net profit after tax (NPAT) from continuing operations of $388.3 million.

The 37.3% slump in full-year net profit was driven by $150 million in impairments due to the soon-to-be-sold SPC business, a loss of in earnings in the soft drinks arm and worsening trading from its Indonesian drinks operations.

Watkins said 2018 was a transition year for the group with earnings impacted by planned investment in the Accelerated Australian Growth Plan, the introduction of container deposit schemes, economic factors in Indonesia and operational challenges in PNG.

“We saw a strong year for the New Zealand, Fiji and Alcohol & Coffee businesses, while there are also positive signs for Australian Beverages with volume growth in Coca-Cola Trademark beverages in the second half.

“Despite the segment result there are also encouraging signs in Indonesia with volume growth over the last nine months of the year. However, as previously reported the Indonesian result was affected by soft market conditions, a weak currency and higher commodity prices. The business is strongly leveraged to capture future growth.”

Australian Beverages’ volume share increased for the year, in both sparkling and still beverages.

Watkins said there was volume growth for Coca-Cola Trademark in the second half led by the continued success of Coca-Cola No Sugar. Low- and no-sugar cola achieved low-single digit volume growth for the year, accelerating in the second half. There was also strong volume growth in dairy and energy throughout the year.

“We continued to see consumer movement towards low- and no-sugar choices. With the success of Coca-Cola No Sugar and low-or no-sugar options in all other major brands, we are well placed to capitalise on this trend,” Watkins said.

“We delivered volume share gains in the water category for the year. However, water volume declined in the second half following changes to promotional strategies with major customers.”

Watkins said the outlook for 2019 remained consistent with what had been presented previously.

“2019 will be the second year of a two-year transition phase for the Group,” she said.

“In Australian Beverages, we will be positioned for growth in 2020, with the completion of the additional $10 million of investment in our Accelerated Australian Growth Plan to increase our salesforce and, with container deposit schemes in NSW and Queensland substantially embedded by the end of 2019.

“Our New Zealand & Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Alcohol & Coffee businesses are expected to again deliver growth in line with our Shareholder Value Proposition.”

“For the Corporate & Services segment, we expect an EBIT loss of $10 to $12 million for FY19 in line with the outlook provided in November 2018, due to lower property rental and services earnings, increased Group capability and investment in IT platforms.”

“The Amatil Group is targeting a return to mid-single digit EPS growth from 2020, in line with our shareholder value proposition. Our level of performance depends on the success of revenue initiatives in Australia, Indonesian economic factors and regulatory conditions in each of our markets.”",Alcohol & Coffee delivers double-digit growth for Coca-Cola Amatil
Treasury Wine Estates' Asia and Global Travel Retail MD Peter Dixon has moved to Accolade Wines.,"February 18, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/penfolds-baijui-2.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=2&Article=treasury-wine-estates-peter-dixon-moves-to-accolade-wines,"Treasury Wine Estates' Asia and Global Travel Retail MD Peter Dixon has moved to rival Accolade Wines.

Dixon has been with TWE since 2008 and moved into his current role in early 2017, following his predecessor Robert Foye being appointed global COO. Foye left the company last month following a breach of the company's internal code of conduct policies.

Dixon will be replaced by Tom King, who moved to Shanghai last year to become chief operating officer of TWE's Asian operations. King was previously managing director of TWE's European operations.

""Peter Dixon has decided to depart the company to pursue other career opportunities and the company thanks Peter for his contribution,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement. ""The fundamentals of the TWE business in Asia remain unchanged, the Company has a strong leadership team in place, and remains committed to its growth plans with its partners"".

Dixon's new employer will be The Carlyle Group, which bought Accolade Wines from CHAMP Private Equity and Constellation Brands in 2018 for about $1 billion. He will assume a leadership role within the company.

Dixon noted on WeChat: “Many people have already heard that I will be leaving TWE shortly. I just want to personally thank all the amazing partners I’ve worked with over the past 10 years in Asia and specifically all the support from the China partners in the last five years.

""I am excited by the opportunities to be in a humble new business with amazing quality wines, which I hope everyone has the opportunity to try shortly! Also a huge thanks to my amazing team at TWE for all they have done and I wish everyone good fortune for the future.""

TWE CEO Michael Clarke revealed during an earnings call last week how the company's unique wholesale model in China gives it an advantage over other wine importers.

TWE defied the Chinese economic slowdown to report Asian EBITS growth up 31% to $153.1 million in its HY19 results.

""As many of you will know, in China, we use a wholesale model where we are the distributor,"" he said. ""Unlike our competitors, we do not rely on a third-party distributor to sell our brands and, therefore, we do not incur the approximately 50% distributor margin.

""Instead, we partner with retailers, wholesalers and state-owned enterprises, and we actively manage those relationships directly, making decisions on how and where our brands are sold, with specific portfolio and channel strategies.""

He explained how the model offered a number of significant benefits, driving value for TWE, its customers and the consumer.

""By self-distributing we operate a more efficient value chain, which means we can deliver a lower price on-shelf and use the margin liberated from not paying a distributor margin to invest more actively behind our brands and drive consumer pull-through over time,"" he said.

He also revealed that TWE's imported value share is around double that of its sell-through value share.

""For example, in a recent period, our imported value share was around 8%,"" he said. ""However, our sell-through value share was closer to 4%. What this difference demonstrates is the efficiency of our model versus our competitors'. Our competitors incur distributor margins, negociants margins, additional duties that we do not incur, which ultimately result in higher retail prices for our competitors because they have more mouths to feed in their value chain.""

Clarke said the wholesale model also enabled TWE to have a deeper understanding of what's happening in the Chinese market, including visibility on customer performance and inventory levels.

""Being closer to the customer positions us to be able to react more readily than our competitors,"" he said.

Looking to the future, Clarke said TWE saw tremendous opportunity to expand its penetration into more cities and across more partners in China.

""We have an ambition to expand our presence and availability by more than 50% in the next three years, and we will achieve this through increased allocations of luxury wine in future periods,"" he said.

""We are the largest wine importer into China. But even after growing our share by over 30% in the last 12 months, we still currently only have a sub-5% market share.""

TWE will also expand the quantities going through its new warehouse in Shanghai and plans to build more warehouses throughout China.

""We're probably looking at three warehouses over time in China, North, Southeast or East and South,"" Clarke revealed.

TWE sees its French labels as being key to winning share. French wine is the largest import category in China, accounting for approximately 30% to 40% of the market.

The company is preparing to launch a French Penfold's wine, plus one through its US Beaulieu Vineyards label and and is also looking at expanding its French label, Maison de Grand Esprit.

""We are confident we can take share in this segment by putting more French wine through our competitively advantaged business model,"" he said.

""The fundamentals of the Asian wine market as a whole remain enormously attractive, and we are not seeing a slowdown in demand for our brands,"" he concluded.",TWE's Peter Dixon heads to Accolade Wines
Peter Lehmann Wines has released a new shiraz that pays tribute to the historic moment the winemaker saved Barossa Valley grape growers.,"February 19, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/lehmann-historic.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=2&Article=peter-lehmann-celebrates-40th-anniversary-with-the-bond-shiraz,"Peter Lehmann Wines is celebrating its 40th anniversary with a new shiraz that pays tribute to a promise the winemaker made to Barossa Valley grape growers.

‘The Bond’ Shiraz has been created to honour the promise Peter Lehmann made to Barossa winemakers and grape growers In the lead-up to the 1979 vintage.

The Barossa had experienced a large fruit surplus that threatened the livelihood of many grape growing families in the region, as they were unable to sell their produce. Understanding that these hard times could compromise the region’s future, Lehmann established his own winery. He took the surplus fruit from the growers, and with a handshake and his word as his bond, promised to repay them once he had starting making wine.

“The Bond is in honour of our winery’s founder Peter Lehmann - a fifth generation Barossan man who was as passionate about his community as he was of the craft of winemaking,” said Tim Dolan, Peter Lehmann Wines Senior Winemaker.

“Our winery and the bourgeoning Barossan region would exist today if it wasn’t for Peter’s courage and commitment back in the late 1970s. We are privileged to continue Peter’s strong relationships with over 140 growers across the region, who provide us with the Barossa’s finest grapes, including some of the greatest and oldest Shiraz in the world.”

Caroline Wood, Senior Brand Manager, Premium Wines – Marketing at Casella Family Brands said Peter Lehmann Wines’ rich history and winemaking expertise makes The Bond a wonderful addition to its stable of premium wines.

“The Bond is an evolved style of Barossa Shiraz that appeals to the modern consumer’s palate while still maintaining Peter Lehmann Wines’ hallmark consistency and quality,” Wood noted.

“Shiraz is the largest varietal by nearly 40% in both value and volume in the total red wine segment in Australia. The Bond sits in the $20-25 price segment which is growing at nearly 7% vs YA in value, as Australian consumers continue to premiumise their wine purchases from cheaper segments.""

The Bond is available now across Australia as an exclusive for independent retailers with a RRP of $24.95.",Peter Lehmann celebrates Barossa bond with special release
"Highlights for Coles Liquor stores in their half-year 2019 results were an increase in basket size, continuing premiumisation and overall spirit category growth.","February 19, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/coles-cheap-Collage.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=2&Article=coles-liquor-sales-revenue-rises-in-half-year-2019-results,"The first half of the 2019 financial year has has delivered flat sales for Coles Liquor.

Sales revenue for the segment was $1.7 billion, an increase of 0.6% on the prior corresponding period.

Overall, Coles' net profit fell 29.4% to $381 million in HY19, due to $146 million in supply chain restructuring charges.The charges relate to Coles' plans to build two new automated warehouses and close smaller distribution centres.

Supermarket earnings fell 26.7% to $441 million despite a 3.6% increase in sales to $16.2 billion (on a retail calendar basis).

Coles Group CEO Steven Cain said the result for the first half of the 2019 financial year was a solid outcome in a challenging retail environment, and Coles was now laying the foundations for long term growth – including a $950 million investment in supply chain automation and the New Alliance Agreement between Coles Express and Viva Energy.

“We have delivered strong cash generation and we have a robust balance sheet which will enable us to reposition the business in the years ahead,"" Cain said.

Coles Liquor's comparable sales growth was flat due to the impact of New Year's Eve, typically a strong trading day in the liquor calendar, which fell in the third quarter of this financial year compared to the second quarter last year.

NYE adjusted comparable sales growth was 1% for the half and 0.7% for the second quarter.

Trading in the second quarter was impacted by unfavourable weather relative to the prior year, which impacted transaction growth particularly in beer and ready-to-drink (RTD) categories.

The company noted that transaction growth accelerated in December across all brands, particularly over the key Christmas period.

Average basket size continued to increase across the period, driven by general market trends of premiumisation and a favourable mix impact from overall spirit category growth.

There was also online sales growth of 30%, with 70% of online orders now fulfilled via Click & Collect.

Gross margin for Coles Liquor increased by 9bps to 28.3% primarily due to margin improvements from ""exclusive brand expansion and improved supplier collaboration"".

During the half, more than 50 new exclusive lines were launched, including a number of award-winning products.

In November, Coles private label wine Story Bay Semillon Sauvignon Blanc 2017, priced at just $7 a bottle, beat a field of 2500 wines to win best wine under $20 at the Winestate Wine of the Year Awards.

Nocturne has made exclusive wines for Coles Liquor since 2012, was responsible for creating the winning wine.

Coles acting chief executive liquor and hotels Cathi Scarce said: To have this recognition from some of the industry’s top wine tasters is further evidence that we’re getting it right by working with the best winemakers in Australia to deliver amazing quality wines at a great price.”

Last year, the company revealed that, across the board, it wants 40% of its products to be homebrand by 2023.

Liquorland continued to be the strongest performer during the period. Coles noted that this was achieved through a continued focus on improving range, innovation through exclusive brands - particularly in the wine category - and provision of more convenient solutions to customers through Click & Collect and same-day and next-day delivery.

The First Choice format continued to evolve with 15 First Choice Liquor Market brand conversions completed during the period. Coles said that conversions were driving trading improvements, with customers responding positively to the refreshed format and offer.

Trading conditions for Vintage Cellars remained challenging during the half, with a store closure also impacting the result.

Investment in the store network continued in the half with 14 Liquorland renewals in the next evolution format. During the period, 16 new stores were opened and seven closed, resulting in a total of 908 retail liquor sites at end of the half.",Coles Liquor sales revenue hits $1.7 billion

""It was the best sparkling rosé that we had tried,"" said De Bortoli (pictured below with Webber). ""Since then, I have wanted us to create something similar.""

They believe they’ve cracked the holy grail with the pale, dry La Bohème Cuvée Rosé, which taps into Australia’s growing love affair with all things pink.

The La Bohème wine range is having its biggest year of growth, up 75.3% versus the previous year with all wines in the range in growth.

More recently, the sparkling rosé category is gaining traction ahead of total sparkling (+12.2% vs +6.9% in the latest MAT)*.

According to De Bortoli, La Bohème Cuvée Rosé is kept as pale and dry as possible and blended in batches or cuvées using vintage and reserve wines. This gives consistency to each bottling and enables the introduction of fresher wine over time for ultimate drinkability and complexity.

""Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier shape the wine, with Chardonnay giving the lovely breadiness, Pinot contributing toasty biscuit characteristics and Meunier giving generosity and complexity,"" she added.

De Bortoli said the wine makes the perfect toast on February 14.

""Who doesn’t love delicious pink bubbles to celebrate Valentine’s Day – they are made for each other!”

Forbes agrees, recently declaring: ""Given its colour - ranging from pink to copper to orange to salmon, and every shade in between - rosé Champagne has an allure - it's sexy and sensual, and no wonder it's the Champagne many turn to on Valentine's Day or any other day that romantic thoughts come to mind.""",Toast Valentine's Day with Australia's prettiest new wine

Treasury Wine Estates has revealed it's entering the beer business and negotiating to acquire two French vineyards as it expands its reach in the US and China.,"February 14, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/crimes-twe.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=3&Article=treasury-wine-estates-to-launch-19-crimes-beer-range,"Treasury Wine Estates has revealed it's entering the beer business and negotiating to acquire two French vineyards as it expands its reach in the US and China.

The brewing announcement marks a return to the fold for TWE, which was spun out of Foster’s Group eight years ago.

The hugely popular 19 Crimes wine brand is poised to launch three craft beers in the US in March — an American India pale ale, a pilsner and a lager.

The beers will be tested in Ohio initially and, if successful, will expand to more states in the US.

An 1869 Irish whiskey is also in the works, with a July launch planned.

TWE CEO Michael Clarke noted during an earnings call today that ""the spirits components from 19 Crimes is going to be big and profitable"".

The Irish whiskey segment is booming, with sustained double digit sales growth. The industry had another record year of export growth in 2018 with the value of exports increasing by €45 million to €623 million.

The 19 Crimes label had been the fastest-growing wine brand in the US over the past three years. It's in its sixth year of ""phenomenal growth"" in the US, with dollar sales increasing by over 70% in the past year.

The decision to broaden the brand into beer and spirits was prompted by liquor retailers asking for 19 Cimes to be expanded to include other beverages.

Meanwhile, Clarke revealed that the company is poised to acquire up to two small wineries in France along with premium vineyards to assist in its push into China.

""We're in dialogue with two to three parties,"" Clarke said.

TWE plans to launch a portfolio of three French-made wines, one of which will be branded Penfolds. The other two French wines will be part of the existing Maison de Grand Esprit and a French version of its Californian premium brand Beaulieu Vineyard.

Previously, the Maison de Grand Esprit brand used wine sourced from external vineyards.

""In order to really have a serious platform that we can grow our French portfolio from, we don't want to use other people's infrastructure to do everything,"" Clarke said. ""We want our infrastructure, we want a permanent team on the ground and the beauty is you can also have visiting winemakers, especially from Australia, going to France because it's contra season obviously, for two different vintages.""

Clarke added that the French wine category makes up 30-40% of the total wine market in China and the company is keen to secure a larger piece of the action.

""The French category, in particular, is one where we see huge opportunity to win share,"" he noted.

TWE announced this morning that its net sales revenue is up 16% to $1,507.7million, representing the largest organic growth rate in the company's history. Overall, the Asian region was the standout performer, with EBITS growth up 31% to $153.1 million.

French brand portfolio net sales revenue in Asia was up 111%.

""The fundamentals of the Asian wine market as a whole remain enormously attractive, and we are not seeing a slowdown in demand for our brands,"" Clarke said.

""We also see tremendous opportunity to expand our penetration into more cities and across more partners in China. We have an ambition to expand our presence and availability by more than 50% in the next three years.""",TWE to launch 19 Crimes beer range

New Zealand winemaker Invivo has collaborated with Sex And The City star Sarah Jessica Parker to launch a Sauvignon Blanc and Rosé.,"February 28, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/invivo-sjp-1.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=1&Article=invivo-and-sarah-jessica-parker-to-launch-new-zealand-wine-range,"New Zealand winemaker Invivo has collaborated with Sex And The City star Sarah Jessica Parker to launch a Sauvignon Blanc and Rosé.

Parker explained: “I am a true wine lover and I love including wine in family dinners and occasions with friends, so this is a very exciting and fun project for me. I’m so looking forward to every single stage of the creation. I intend to be very hands-on throughout the process, as I am with all my endeavors, and could not be partnering with a better brand than Invivo.”

Invivo said the new collaboration is not a celebrity endorsement, with Parker involved in every aspect of the creation of the new wine, from the naming and label design to the winemaking itself and choosing the final blend. She is also a shareholder in the brand, making this a long-term venture for both parties.

“We want this wine to be 100% Sarah Jessica Parker. So other than selecting the base wines for a Sauvignon Blanc and Rosé, I’ll be taking a back seat and letting her create the blends,” explained Invivo winemaker Rob Cameron. “It comes down to SJP’s palate and preferences. We want to create wines that she truly loves and wants to drink and share with friends.”

Parker added: “Invivo also sent me some of their other wine – which I LOVED – as well they told me a little bit more about their story. I’m so looking forward to travelling to New Zealand to see where the grapes grow and the wine is made. The boys even brought me a pair of “gumboots” which they assure me are the height of Kiwi vineyard fashion. Regardless, happy to have and perhaps even wear them.”

Why SJP? Invivo co-owner Tim Lightbourne said the opportunity came about through a discussion with a mutual friend.

""We didn't want a silent partner or just a familiar face – we wanted someone who will throw themselves into the process and make wine that's all about them and reflects their good taste,"" he told the NZ Herald.

Invivo has been working on the collaboration for over a year.

Parker will attend the Sauvignon Blanc and Rosé launch event in New Zealand later in the year where the wine will be revealed. The wine will be sold into the US and locally.

""Sauvignon Blanc in the States is flying [off shelves] and I think as an industry we are only scratching the surface. There's huge potential,"" said Lightbourne.",Sex And The City star to launch New Zealand wine range

Never Never Distilling Co's Southern Strength Gin has beaten some of the world's biggest brands, including Tanqueray 10, to the top spot.

Judges said the South Australian gin featured: ""Some pine leaves and resin, with a hint of thyme and a whisper of cinnamon and tree bark. Juniper and citrus are in a nice supporting role. Nice complexity, but the balance impresses most.""

It's the first time an Australian gin has scooped the top prize, a huge accolade for a distillery that only launched in 2017.

One of the co-founders of the distillery, Sean Baxter, told The Gin Queen: ""It was a little emotional for me seeing our gin alongside Tanqueray 10. It’s even in the San Francisco Spirits Awards Hall of Fame, because it won so many times. Being the Aussie representative in that category was pretty special.

'Southern Strength gin was created with the bartender in mind. It has a higher ABV and works so well in cocktails. I hope this award will bring more consumers to try Southern Strength, and maybe retailers and bars who might only pick one of our three gins to sell.'

Managing director George Georgiadis added in a press release: “This is a huge accolade for our young distillery. It’s a much-coveted award and firmly puts Australia and South Australian gin on the world map, in a similar guise to what the World’s Best Whisky award did for Sullivan’s Cove and Tasmanian whisky.”

19 Crimes was the first talking wine label via the AR Living Wine Labels app and has quickly become a $13million brand in Australia, ranking as the third favourite red wine in the $10-$14.99 bracket, according to IRI liquor data.

It's also been the fastest-growing wine brand in the US over the past three years and is in its sixth year of ""phenomenal growth"", with dollar sales increasing by over 70% in the past year.

The Aussie campaign finds a new way to bring to life the rich and authentic story of the convicts turned colonists who feature on the brand’s labels.

Over the next month, 19 Crimes will take over two of Australia’s busiest train stations – Bondi Junction and Sydney Central Station, where the brand will be seen by more than 2.3 million commuters each week.

Heavily focused on out-of-home channels across the eastern seaboard, it also features disruptive hand painted murals with light projections, as well as multiple street posters with jail cell bars covering the prisoners’ mug shots.

19 Crimes will also debut almost 250 large in store displays mimicking a jail cell, POS and customer exclusive activations. In addition, the campaign supports a national in-store promotion, where consumers can win flight vouchers if they find the 19th Crime under the cap.

“Following the phenomenal success 19 Crimes has had in the US, it’s an exciting time to be launching a campaign for a brand that has already gained traction quickly and organically here in Australia,"" said 19 Crimes Brand Director, Clive Coleman.

""We are thrilled to be bringing the 19 Crimes story to life in a non-conventional and disruptive way. This campaign is a great way to educate consumers on a story rich in history, whilst also highlighting a strong portfolio of quality, affordable wines. It would be a crime not to drink it.”

AVL Chief Executive Neil McGuigan said the half-year result ""again reinforcing that our strategies are correct"".

""The McGuigan brand continues to perform exceptionally well in the UK with sales up 16% when compared to the prior period. McGuigan remains the third largest global wine brand in the UK,"" he said.

The contribution from AVL's UK/Europe operations increased by $1.7 million to $6.4 million due mainly

 to increased sales of the McGuigan brand and improved distribution and mix.

It was also a strong result for the company in Asia, with sales increasing 51%. McGuigan sales increased by 47% while Nepenthe and Tempus sales also increased, but from a lower base.

""While the contribution from the Asian division remains relatively small when compared to other segments of our business, it is showing good growth,"" McGuigan noted. ""As we have previously stated, we remain confident that the long-term outlook for sales into Asia looks positive, but we must manage this growth appropriately in terms of pricing and depletions.""

Australian sales increased by 6% with bottled branded sales up 8% and cask sales up 2%.

Sales of McGuigan increased by 13% and the higher margin brand, Nepenthe, increased by 6%. Tempus Two increased by 3% on the back of promotional phasing with strong expectations following significant growth in the prior period.

Meanwhile, New Zealand sales increased by 16% with all the growth coming from the McGuigan brand.

The company revealed that this year’s vintage is underway and early indications are that the recent extreme heat and dry conditions have negatively impacted yields across most grape growing regions.

""Together with the frost that occurred on some of our vineyards in October last year, we are expecting that our vineyard yields will be at least 10% below expectation,"" McGuigan added.

However, he said the company had already taken steps earlier in the year to ensure it had enough wine by entering into bulk wine supply contracts and through the long-term lease agreement on the 10,000 tonne Millewa vineyard.

The combined impact of this frost plus the recent extreme weather is expected to impact the company's full-year SGARA result by $3million to $5million (before tax) against expectation.

AVL noted that it is continuing its ""transformation from a bulk wine company to a quality respected branded wine business"".

""The transformation is supported by the fact that our three key brands, McGuigan, Tempus Two and Nepenthe, have grown by 64% over the last five financial years. As evidenced by our six month result to December 2018, this transformation is continuing and gathering pace.""",Australian Vintage Limited branded sales up 46%

The aim: to celebrate the talent, creativity and originality that personify Sydney’s bar scene, while raising money for animals - who bring to our lives even more pleasure than our favourite bars and drinks.

Nine years on, Bars March has evolved into an annual month-long party and favourite event on Sydney’s social calendar. It has been supported by more than 400 bars and raised $80,000 for Animal Welfare League NSW.

During the month of March special cocktails will once again be sold by bars in Sydney and Wollongong to raise funds, while Melbourne, Byron Bay and Toowoomba have been added to the mix this year – with venues ranging from craft cocktail bars to big lively pubs, urban breweries and distilleries.

The first bar to sign up in Melbourne is Port Melbourne’s dog-friendly whisky bar The Tipsy Cow, owned by dog lover and vet Anupam Sharma.

The multi-awarded Loch and Key, upstairs at Melbourne’s oldest pub, The Captain Melville has also come aboard with their canine regular Tofu set to make a star appearance during BARS MARCH. And fellow acclaimed CBD haunt Golden Monkey also joins the fun.

In Sydney, the doggone good celebrations will kick off at Surry Hills' new dog-friendly hotspot Caffe Bartolo (owned by dog-loving bar guru Jared Merlino) with a three-day $10 brunch cocktail special from Friday 1 March to Sunday 3 March.

Meanwhile in the inner west, dog-friendly ‘The Erko’ - AKA Erskineville Hotel - will start the month with a Paws for a Pint dog party on Saturday, March 2.

In Toowoomba, Bar Wunder will be staging celebrations in their dog-devoted beer garden that sells doggy beer and dog treats.

Balcony Bar & Oyster Co. will fly the flag up in Byron Bay, while Wollongong is proudly represented by the dog-friendly North Wollongong Hotel for the second year running.

Some firm favourites are also back in Sydney, including top fundraiser for the last two years running, O Bar Dining. This Sydney CBD venue raised $3508 for Animal Welfare League NSW in 2018, selling 1754 Unleashed cocktails over the month.

Sydney’s other participating venues for 2019 include The Commodore (Milsons Point), The Rio (Summer Hill) The Carrington (Surry Hills), Frisco Hotel (Woolloomooloo); Kittyhawk (CBD), The Lobo Plantation (CBD), The Swinging Cat (CBD), East Village Sydney (Darlinghurst), Big Poppa’s (Darlinghurst), Watsons Bay Hotel, (Watson’s Bay) and The Royal Leichhardt (Leichhardt).

In another first for 2019, Bars March will be supported by dog-loving Tito’s Handmade Vodka. With a slogan ‘vodka for dog people,’ the US craft spirit is a dedicated supporter of its local animal shelters and the distillery is home to various rescue dogs. Bars March charity fundraising cocktails in select bars will feature Tito’s Handmade Vodka.

Celebrity ambassadors for Bars March include TV vet Dr Katrina Warren, garden guru Jamie Durie and a squad of four-legged Instagram stars – the Kardashians of the canine world. They’ll all be out and about at the bars during March.

“Our other key mission is to showcase the creativity, talent and hard work that makes the Australian bar scene truly world class,"" Cooper explained. ""While our ‘why’ is helping animals, we’re also a hearty cheer squad for the hardworking people who drive the hospitality industry. Put simply, we love bars, and we want to spread that love.”

The venue was transformed into a Patrón tequila home, complete with signature glassware and mixology flair.

Three cocktails were served: Patrón Classic Margarita, Patrón Jalapeno Margarita and Patrón Lychee Margarita. They were matched with delicious Mexican food including soft tacos and ceviche.

World Margarita Day is celebrated every year on February 22. The first margarita is said to have been created in 1938 by Carlos ‘Danny’ Herrera, who hoped to impress a showgirl named Marjorie King with the concoction.

And it's never looked back! Recent analysis of on-premise cocktail consumption by Nielsen CGA has found that four of the top five best-selling cocktails across the United States start with the letter “M,” with margaritas topping the list.

Patrón has shared the recipe for its variation so tequila lovers can say ‘salud’ at home.

Method: Combine liquid ingredients in a cocktail shaker and shake vigorously with ice to chill. Strain onto fresh ice in a rocks glass and garnish with a lime wedge. Optionally, salt half the rim of the glass with kosher salt.",PHOTO SPECIAL: Patrón celebrates World Margarita Day
"Coca-Cola Amatil is celebrating another year of double-digit EBIT growth for Alcohol & Coffee, despite the continuing impact of container deposit schemes.","February 21, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/canadian-club-Collage-2.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=3&Article=alcohol-and-coffee-delivers-double-digit-growth-for-coca-cola-amatil,"Coca-Cola Amatil is celebrating another year of double-digit EBIT growth for Alcohol & Coffee in 2018, bucking the continuing impact of container deposit schemes on the company.

Alcohol achieved volume growth, high single-digit revenue growth and another year of double digit EBIT growth for the year. Spirits and premix grew ahead of market. Paradise Beverages continued to grow sales. Coffee grew revenue and volume for the year with positive drivers including coffee bean products and sales in grocery. EBIT performance reflected investment in international opportunities including in Indonesia. A new high value premium brand, SoCo Coffee Roasters, was also launched during the year.

Revenue for Alcohol & Coffee was up 8% to $609.8million in 2018, with underlying EBIT at $55.7million, up 12.1%.

Coca-Cola Amatil said the result was driven by strong performance in the spirits and premix segment, driven by Canadian Club, Maker's Mark and Roku Gin.

Group Managing Director Alison Watkins noted: ""Alcohol & Coffee achieved another year of double-digit EBIT growth while also funding investment in initiatives for our growth aspirations.""

Coca-Cola Amatil's full-year results for 2018 delivered underlying earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) from continuing operations of $634.5 million and underlying net profit after tax (NPAT) from continuing operations of $388.3 million.

The 37.3% slump in full-year net profit was driven by $150 million in impairments due to the soon-to-be-sold SPC business, a loss of in earnings in the soft drinks arm and worsening trading from its Indonesian drinks operations.

Watkins said 2018 was a transition year for the group with earnings impacted by planned investment in the Accelerated Australian Growth Plan, the introduction of container deposit schemes, economic factors in Indonesia and operational challenges in PNG.

“We saw a strong year for the New Zealand, Fiji and Alcohol & Coffee businesses, while there are also positive signs for Australian Beverages with volume growth in Coca-Cola Trademark beverages in the second half.

“Despite the segment result there are also encouraging signs in Indonesia with volume growth over the last nine months of the year. However, as previously reported the Indonesian result was affected by soft market conditions, a weak currency and higher commodity prices. The business is strongly leveraged to capture future growth.”

Australian Beverages’ volume share increased for the year, in both sparkling and still beverages.

Watkins said there was volume growth for Coca-Cola Trademark in the second half led by the continued success of Coca-Cola No Sugar. Low- and no-sugar cola achieved low-single digit volume growth for the year, accelerating in the second half. There was also strong volume growth in dairy and energy throughout the year.

“We continued to see consumer movement towards low- and no-sugar choices. With the success of Coca-Cola No Sugar and low-or no-sugar options in all other major brands, we are well placed to capitalise on this trend,” Watkins said.

“We delivered volume share gains in the water category for the year. However, water volume declined in the second half following changes to promotional strategies with major customers.”

Watkins said the outlook for 2019 remained consistent with what had been presented previously.

“2019 will be the second year of a two-year transition phase for the Group,” she said.

“In Australian Beverages, we will be positioned for growth in 2020, with the completion of the additional $10 million of investment in our Accelerated Australian Growth Plan to increase our salesforce and, with container deposit schemes in NSW and Queensland substantially embedded by the end of 2019.

“Our New Zealand & Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Alcohol & Coffee businesses are expected to again deliver growth in line with our Shareholder Value Proposition.”

“For the Corporate & Services segment, we expect an EBIT loss of $10 to $12 million for FY19 in line with the outlook provided in November 2018, due to lower property rental and services earnings, increased Group capability and investment in IT platforms.”

“The Amatil Group is targeting a return to mid-single digit EPS growth from 2020, in line with our shareholder value proposition. Our level of performance depends on the success of revenue initiatives in Australia, Indonesian economic factors and regulatory conditions in each of our markets.”",Alcohol & Coffee delivers double-digit growth for Coca-Cola Amatil
Starward held a remarkable tasting event Cunard's Queen Elizabeth this week to celebrate its new Seafarer whisky.,"February 22, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/IMG_9728%20(1).jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=3&Article=starward-launches-whisky-matured-aboard-cunards-queen-elizabeth,"Starward held a remarkable tasting event Cunard's Queen Elizabeth this week to celebrate its new Seafarer whisky.

The distiller filled two identical Australian shiraz oak barrels with whisky last year and bolted one to the deck of the Queen Elizabeth to sail 95,000 nautical miles around the globe, while the other stayed at its Melbourne base.

A lucky group of drinks media and whisky aficionados, including Drinks Bulletin and Drinks Trade, were aboard to sample both whiskies and it was remarkable to taste the distinct differences between them.

The product of a special partnership between Cunard and Starward, designed to celebrate Queen Elizabeth’s inaugural homeporting season in Australia this year, the single malt whisky has experienced temperatures ranging from zero to 32 degrees centigrade as it travelled the world, moving with the motion of the ocean and soaking up the salt of the sea air on its epic journey.

The whisky spent 160 days at sea and a further 187 days visiting more than 90 beautiful ports Clearly weathered by its journey, the now-grey barrel was offloaded in Melbourne on February 10 this year and returned to the distillery.

There Starward founder David Vitale assessed the final whisky, comparing it to a control barrel of the same drop which had remained in Starward’s distillery.

The result is a whisky like no other, according to Vitale.

“The maturation environment is crucial to the final flavour of any whisky so this was an amazing opportunity to create something different,"" he said. ""There’s no doubt The Seafarer’s odyssey on Queen Elizabeth has resulted in a unique whisky, which clearly has a great story to tell through its flavours,” he said. “Even if we put a barrel of the same whisky on another ship for a year, we could never emulate the same weather conditions, so this really is a one-of-a-kind drop.

“While The Seafarer still has Starward’s trademark fruit characters, the oak influences are stronger, our jammy characteristics have developed with time and the dessert cooking spices like vanillin are more identifiable.

“This is a whisky that’s been on an amazing journey so the result is appropriately epic. It’s a special drop so we’re recommending that it should be drunk neat or with a dash of water, so the subtleties of its flavour can be savoured.”

Seafarer has an aroma of marzipan, apricot, currants, red apple, and baked spices; and a warming palate with French oak spice and mildly salted berries.

It also has a lower alcohol content than its sister whisky following its time at sea, giving it a more mellow nose and flavour. This is the first time a Starward whisky has lost alcohol percentage in barrel.

The whisky is now available to guests on board the 2081-guest Queen Elizabeth as well as visitors to Starward's Port Melbourne distillery.

The cruise line’s Australian partnerships mark Queen Elizabeth’s first season based in Australia, with her 54-day deployment stretching over February and March this year. The ship will return in December for a 101-day season over the 2019-20 summer, and again in November 2020 for an unparalleled 118-day deployment.

At 90,900 tonnes, Queen Elizabeth is the second largest ship ever to sail in Cunard’s fleet. Launched in 2010, she is also the youngest in the luxury cruise line’s current trio of Queens with features including more than 10 restaurants and cafés, a Games Deck featuring paddle tennis, croquet and bowls, a two-storey library, a ballroom and the three-deck Royal Court Theatre seating 800 guests and offering private boxes.

AB InBev wants to grow its percentage of sales from lower or no-alcohol beer to 20% by 2025 and Australia has already hit the target.,"March 05, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/great-northern-super-crisp.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=1&Article=australia-leads-the-world-in-ab-inbev-low-alcohol-beer-market,"AB InBev has announced it wants to grow the percentage of its sales that come from lower or no-alcohol beer to 20% by 2025.

And it's revealed that Australia is one of six countries that's already hit the target, along with China, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama and Honduras.

In 2018, the company launched 12 new no- and low-alcohol beers globally, with Carlton Zero called out as one of the big success stories.

In December, a spokesman for CUB confirmed Carlton Zero ""has been one of the most successful new product launches we’ve ever had"".

According to market research company IRI, monthly sales of non-alcoholic beer in bottle shops increased up to 10-fold in the lead up to Christmas, following Carlton Zero's launch.

Big profit potential in low and no

More than one in four beers drunk globally are brewed by AB InBev, with 8% of its worldwide beer sales by volume coming from beers with lower or no alcohol.

Non-alcoholic brews are the fastest-growing segment in the beer industry. While overall beer sales are stagnating, non-alcoholic-beer sales have grown by 3.9% on average for the past five years according to The Wall Street Journal.

AB InBev CEO Carlos Brito told investors in a call last week that low- and no-alcohol beer are a crucial global trend.

His announcement followed the company releasing its FY18 results, which saw revenue growth of 4.8% for FY18 and a 0.3% increase in volumes.

Australia grew revenue by low single digits, which the company said was ""despite lower volumes due to increased promotional activity by competitors and a softer industry performance amidst declining consumer confidence"".

""Great Northern remains a key engine of growth, with continued double digit growth of both Original and Super

Crisp variants,"" the company added. ""Our craft acquisitions continue to grow in strength with double digit volume growth. In 4Q18, we further strengthened our NABLAB portfolio with the launch of our first non-alcohol beer, Carlton Zero.""

Brito said current moderation and health and wellness trends had led the company to provide consumers with high-quality no- and low-alcohol beers, which can play an important role in reducing harmful consumption.

""A key to explaining this piece of our portfolio's innovation to ensure that we have a robust portfolio to meet different consumer needs,"" he said. :As such we launched 12 new products this year resulting in 76 brands globally that qualify as no- and low-alcohol.

""What makes the segment even more exciting is that this brand is often command a premium price point and the margins are typically higher since excise taxes tend to be lower.

""And in terms of no-and-low alcohol beers, we said for many years now that we see a big opportunity because when you look at health and wellness and when you look at how eclectic beer is, beer can go all the way to zero-zero.""

Brito added that Budweiser 00 was currently being tested in some US markets and had tested ""very well"" in Canada.

The success stories in the full-strength market

As for its regular strength beers, Brito said Budweiser, Stella Artois, and Corona continued to lead growth for AB InBev and now represent more than 20% of total company revenue.

""In 2018 they grew revenue by 9% and 13.1% outside of their home markets where they typically command a premium price point. Budweiser had an outstanding year grew revenue by 10% outside of the US its home country. Much of the success is driven by our biggest and most successful commercial container ever during the World Cup where we'll use our global sponsorship to elevate the brand and introduced it in many new markets.

""Budweiser role in our premium portfolios will offer consumers a trade-off from core beer especially in early-stage maturity markets. It's a high-energy social occasions and it's a flagship premium brand in the boys space.

""Stella to also delivered solid performance with revenue growing 52% this year, the growth was driven by a broad group of markets as the brand experience double-digit revenue growth in more than 25 countries. Stella Artois one of the brands in our portfolio with the richest history with the brewing heritage in its home country of Belgium dating back to 1366 and has an important role to play in our portfolio by owning the meal occasion.

""Corona continues to deliver phenomenal growth this year with global revenue growth of 17.6% and up 28.5% outside its home country of Mexico. This growth was led by China, Colombia, Argentina and Western Europe as well of a very strong performance within Mexico. Corona is our most premium global brand and has a very clear role to play in a portfolio for coed social occasions. Corona currently has a market share of 3% or higher in just three countries where we own the brand. With the brand growing double-digit globally we believe it's still far from reaching its full potential.""",Australia leads the world in AB InBev's lower-alcohol beer push

New Zealand winemaker Invivo has collaborated with Sex And The City star Sarah Jessica Parker to launch a Sauvignon Blanc and Rosé.,"February 28, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/invivo-sjp-1.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=2&Article=invivo-and-sarah-jessica-parker-to-launch-new-zealand-wine-range,"New Zealand winemaker Invivo has collaborated with Sex And The City star Sarah Jessica Parker to launch a Sauvignon Blanc and Rosé.

Parker explained: “I am a true wine lover and I love including wine in family dinners and occasions with friends, so this is a very exciting and fun project for me. I’m so looking forward to every single stage of the creation. I intend to be very hands-on throughout the process, as I am with all my endeavors, and could not be partnering with a better brand than Invivo.”

Invivo said the new collaboration is not a celebrity endorsement, with Parker involved in every aspect of the creation of the new wine, from the naming and label design to the winemaking itself and choosing the final blend. She is also a shareholder in the brand, making this a long-term venture for both parties.

“We want this wine to be 100% Sarah Jessica Parker. So other than selecting the base wines for a Sauvignon Blanc and Rosé, I’ll be taking a back seat and letting her create the blends,” explained Invivo winemaker Rob Cameron. “It comes down to SJP’s palate and preferences. We want to create wines that she truly loves and wants to drink and share with friends.”

Parker added: “Invivo also sent me some of their other wine – which I LOVED – as well they told me a little bit more about their story. I’m so looking forward to travelling to New Zealand to see where the grapes grow and the wine is made. The boys even brought me a pair of “gumboots” which they assure me are the height of Kiwi vineyard fashion. Regardless, happy to have and perhaps even wear them.”

Why SJP? Invivo co-owner Tim Lightbourne said the opportunity came about through a discussion with a mutual friend.

""We didn't want a silent partner or just a familiar face – we wanted someone who will throw themselves into the process and make wine that's all about them and reflects their good taste,"" he told the NZ Herald.

Invivo has been working on the collaboration for over a year.

Parker will attend the Sauvignon Blanc and Rosé launch event in New Zealand later in the year where the wine will be revealed. The wine will be sold into the US and locally.

""Sauvignon Blanc in the States is flying [off shelves] and I think as an industry we are only scratching the surface. There's huge potential,"" said Lightbourne.",Sex And The City star to launch New Zealand wine range

Campbell told the Cairns Post: “Everyone said he was a really nice bloke. He’s definitely friendly.

“I saw him walking up the hall one night. I said, ‘A-a-a-a-athol’, like that and he looked around at me and walked straight through the wall.

“A lot of people say they see a light flying around their room, or sometimes feel something pushing on their chest. But he’s never done any harm.”

About 10 years after Athol died, the Cairns Post reported one of many sightings of the old man. A patron revealing he was singing at the bar when a man dressed in the style of the ’50s or ’60s with dark slacks told him he used to live here years ago.

“I looked over my shoulder and he just faded in front of the wash basin — sort of quickly.”

The pub, which is located few minutes' drive outside Ingham, was built in 1888 and rebuilt in 1935 after being burnt down. The sale also features the bar, publican living quarters, a commercial kitchen and seven hotel rooms.

The inaugural Meet the Makers: Women in Beer, Wine & Spirits is taking place in Sydney, and drinks lovers can meet some of Australia’s and New Zealand’s finest female brewers, winemakers and distillers.

Some of the stars of the show have given their verdict on why they're so excited to be part of the event.

""It is important to embrace the women in this industry because they bring a whole different side of it out, breathing brand new energy and insights into the industry,"" said Ally Ayres, distiller & co-owner, Karu Distillery. ""This festival is about celebrating and embracing that!

Vanessa Wilton, co-founder and co-owner, Manly Spirits Co. Distillery (above), added: “Women tend to spend more time being ‘doers’ not leaving much time to actually promote their highly skilled roles in the spirits/beer/wine industry. This festival gives a platform for women to stand up and show the public what their skills and hard work have created.”

The number of women employed in wine making is estimated to be 38%. However, when it comes to leadership and senior roles, female representation has been estimated at 10% or less.

Sarah Pidgeon, winemaker at Wynns Coonawarra, noted: ""Events like the Meet the Makers: Women in Beer, Wine & Spirits festival gives women a chance to form a community to help and encourage each other. Communities like this may be the first step towards women seeing the possibilities with staying with winemaking careers rather than exiting altogether or changing paths.""

According to Australian Distillers Association, women make up approximately 15% of distillers in the industry. There are no official stats on the number of female brewers in Australia.

“Being part of Meet the Makers: Women in Beer, Wine & Spirits is important to Modus and myself because there is no reason this industry should be seen as male dominated when there are so many of us women that work and love this industry,"" Jaz Wearin (above), co-owner of Modus Operandi Brewing said. ""We would love to see more women be welcomed into the beer world, and by being part of this festival is another positive step towards achieving this.”

Laura Carter, distiller and co-owner, Applewood Distillery, added: ""There are so many women in our industry working hard, often behind the scenes, creating incredible products and building our industry. This festival is a chance for us to showcase our hard work and hopefully inspire the next generation of female distillers to join us.""

Meet the Makers: Women in Beer, Wine & Spirits is taking place at Australian Technology Park in Sydney, and kicks off with a session on Friday, March 8 - International Women’s Day - with two more sessions on Saturday, March 9.

Up to 30 winemakers, distillers and brewers will be serving samples during the festival.

"Australia has delivered ""very strong underlying net sales growth"" of 7% for Brown-Forman in the nine months of fiscal 2019, driven by Jack Daniel's RTDs.","March 07, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/Jack-Daniels.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=1&Article=jack-daniels-rtds-lead-profits-for-brown-forman-australia,"Australia has delivered ""very strong underlying net sales growth"" of 7% for Brown-Forman in the nine months of fiscal 2019, driven by Jack Daniel's RTDs.

The result was led by higher prices of core Jack Daniel's RTD brands, Jack Daniel’s & Cola and Jack Daniel’s Double Jack, along with volumetric growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey.

Jack Daniel’s maintained its position as the number one most valuable spirits trademark in Australia last year, while Gentleman Jack saw growth of 17% year-on-year and Woodford Reserve recorded growth of 34%.

Outside of whiskey, El Jimador was the number one growth driver in Australia, up 17%, while Herradura saw growth of 13%.

In the year-to-date fiscal 2019 - to January 31, 2019 - the company’s reported global net sales increased 3% to $US2,580 million (+5% on an underlying basis).

CEO Lawson Whiting said: “Our portfolio of premium spirits brands delivered solid rates of sustained sales growth, led by the strength of our bourbon and tequila brands, as well as the international expansion of the Jack Daniel’s trademark [such as Double Jack and Dry in Australia]. We remain on track to deliver another strong year of results as cost discipline helped offset some of the large burden we are absorbing due to the retaliatory tariffs on American whiskey.

“The growth opportunity for our brand portfolio remains significant, and our teams around the world are executing on our long-term growth strategy.”

The Jack Daniel’s family of brands grew underlying net sales 4% (+2% reported) globally, and was negatively impacted by approximately one percentage point due to tariff-related lower net prices. Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey experienced 2% underlying net sales growth (flat reported), driven by volume gains.

Gentleman Jack grew underlying net sales 8% (+8% reported). Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey’s underlying net sales gained 6% (+6% reported) and Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Fire increased underlying net sales 6% (+5% reported), fueled by continued global growth for both brands. Jack Daniel’s RTD/RTP business delivered underlying net sales growth of 8% (+3% reported) despite difficult comparisons against last year’s high rates of growth.

Brown-Forman’s portfolio of super-premium American whiskey brands, including Woodford Reserve, Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel and Gentleman Jack, delivered 24% underlying net sales growth (+21% reported), as category trends remain favorable. Woodford Reserve grew underlying net sales 24% (+21% reported) and is enjoying out-sized growth as the leader in the super-premium bourbon category. Old Forester grew net sales double-digits due to volumetric gains and favorable price/mix.

el Jimador grew underlying net sales by 15% (+11% reported), propelled by volume growth and higher prices in the United States as well as strong takeaway trends in Mexico after repositioning the brand in the premium space over the last few years. Herradura grew underlying net sales by 14% (+9% reported), with double-digit gains in the United States and Mexico fueled by continued consumer demand for Herradura Ultra. New Mix’s underlying net sales grew double-digits, helped by new SKUs and innovation including the launch of New Mix Mineral.

Finlandia vodka’s underlying net sales declined 7% (-9% reported). The decrease in underlying net sales was driven by a competitive retail environment for vodka in Poland and the tough prior year comparison when we changed to a new distributor in Russia.

""For many years, Brown-Forman's growth was powered by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in the United States but over the last decade, we've invested significantly in the international expansion of the company,"" Whiting said.

""In terms of our increasing geographic breath, 30 years ago roughly 20% of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey volumes were from outside the US, today over 60% of the volumes are international and over the last decade 80% of it's incremental growth has come from markets outside of the US.

""Europe and Australia remain solid contributors as we have been steadily investing in our route-to-consumer capabilities.""",Jack Daniel's RTDs lead profits for Brown-Forman Australia

Some of the stars of the show have given their verdict on why they're so excited to be part of the event.

""It is important to embrace the women in this industry because they bring a whole different side of it out, breathing brand new energy and insights into the industry,"" said Ally Ayres, distiller & co-owner, Karu Distillery. ""This festival is about celebrating and embracing that!

Vanessa Wilton, co-founder and co-owner, Manly Spirits Co. Distillery (above), added: “Women tend to spend more time being ‘doers’ not leaving much time to actually promote their highly skilled roles in the spirits/beer/wine industry. This festival gives a platform for women to stand up and show the public what their skills and hard work have created.”

The number of women employed in wine making is estimated to be 38%. However, when it comes to leadership and senior roles, female representation has been estimated at 10% or less.

Sarah Pidgeon, winemaker at Wynns Coonawarra, noted: ""Events like the Meet the Makers: Women in Beer, Wine & Spirits festival gives women a chance to form a community to help and encourage each other. Communities like this may be the first step towards women seeing the possibilities with staying with winemaking careers rather than exiting altogether or changing paths.""

According to Australian Distillers Association, women make up approximately 15% of distillers in the industry. There are no official stats on the number of female brewers in Australia.

“Being part of Meet the Makers: Women in Beer, Wine & Spirits is important to Modus and myself because there is no reason this industry should be seen as male dominated when there are so many of us women that work and love this industry,"" Jaz Wearin (above), co-owner of Modus Operandi Brewing said. ""We would love to see more women be welcomed into the beer world, and by being part of this festival is another positive step towards achieving this.”

Laura Carter, distiller and co-owner, Applewood Distillery, added: ""There are so many women in our industry working hard, often behind the scenes, creating incredible products and building our industry. This festival is a chance for us to showcase our hard work and hopefully inspire the next generation of female distillers to join us.""

Meet the Makers: Women in Beer, Wine & Spirits is taking place at Australian Technology Park in Sydney, and kicks off with a session on Friday, March 8 - International Women’s Day - with two more sessions on Saturday, March 9.

Up to 30 winemakers, distillers and brewers will be serving samples during the festival.

Tickets range from $50 to $60 per session, and include complimentary tastings from all producers, a branded glass to keep, a booklet and entertainment. Masterclasses are also available at an additional cost.

An Aussie gin - Never Never Distilling Co's Southern Strength Gin - has won World's Best Classic Gin at the World Gin Awards in London.,"February 27, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/never-never-gin-2%20(1).jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=3&Article=never-never-wins-worlds-best-classic-gin,"An Aussie gin has won World's Best Classic Gin at the World Gin Awards in London.

Never Never Distilling Co's Southern Strength Gin has beaten some of the world's biggest brands, including Tanqueray 10, to the top spot.

Judges said the South Australian gin featured: ""Some pine leaves and resin, with a hint of thyme and a whisper of cinnamon and tree bark. Juniper and citrus are in a nice supporting role. Nice complexity, but the balance impresses most.""

It's the first time an Australian gin has scooped the top prize, a huge accolade for a distillery that only launched in 2017.

One of the co-founders of the distillery, Sean Baxter, told The Gin Queen: ""It was a little emotional for me seeing our gin alongside Tanqueray 10. It’s even in the San Francisco Spirits Awards Hall of Fame, because it won so many times. Being the Aussie representative in that category was pretty special.

'Southern Strength gin was created with the bartender in mind. It has a higher ABV and works so well in cocktails. I hope this award will bring more consumers to try Southern Strength, and maybe retailers and bars who might only pick one of our three gins to sell.'

Managing director George Georgiadis added in a press release: “This is a huge accolade for our young distillery. It’s a much-coveted award and firmly puts Australia and South Australian gin on the world map, in a similar guise to what the World’s Best Whisky award did for Sullivan’s Cove and Tasmanian whisky.”

German hypermarket Kaufland has announced it will build Australia's largest distribution centre in the northern suburbs of Melbourne.,"March 11, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/kaufland-julia.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=1&Article=kaufland-receives-planning-approval-for-first-three-australian-stores,"German hypermarket Kaufland has announced it will build Australia's largest distribution centre in the northern suburbs of Melbourne.

The centre will service the first three Kaufland stores in the country. It will be situated on a 28-hectare site on the Hume Highway in the Merrifield Business Park and, according to The Australian Financial Review, is ""substantially larger than state-of-the-art warehouses being developed or recently opened by Coles, Woolworths and Amazon, all of which are investing billions to optimise their supply chains"".

""Our new state-of-the-art distribution centre at Merrifield Business Park will be the company's single-biggest investment in Australia and enable Kaufland's expansion,"" a Kaufland spokesman said. ""Merrifield was selected for its strategic location and ability to cater for future expansion of the facility.""

The $450 million distribution centre will feature extensive temperature-controlled storage and the latest automated warehousing with 40-metre-high bay storage and a 3600-square-metre office.

According to The Sydney Morning Herald, the announcement of the centre ""will send shivers through the country’s fiercely competitive $90 billion grocery sector"".

The company received planning approval for its first three stores, in Victoria at Chirnside Park, Dandenong and Epping, last week. The Chirnside Park site is next to a Dan Murphy’s liquor outlet.

An independent advisory panel gave the go-ahead despite numerous objections.

A ‘Save Our Shops’ campaign run by local small businesses in Victoria - including IGA, FoodWorks and Friendly Grocer - has claimed that Kaufland will “destroy” them.

In response, the Kaufland spokeswoman said the company was “committed to working with local communities in an honest, transparent and fair way”.

“When the market grows, so will we, and so will our competitors,"" she noted. ""When a new player enters the retail market, it encourages everyone to raise the bar in terms of quality, service and choice.”

Kaufland Australia managing director Julia Kern celebrated the planning approval news with Treasurer of Victoria and Minister for Economic Development, Tim Pallas (above).

""It all adds up to $459 million of investment, more jobs and more choice for Victorian shoppers,"" Pallas said. ""Add that to the basket.""

Kern thanked the Victorian Government and everyone who participated in the independent Advisory Panel process. She said the initial investment would create up to 1600 jobs and ""stimulate much needed competition and consumer choice in Australia's supermarket sector"".

Kaufland supermarkets will have a total store area of 4000 square metres and will feature local, regional and international products at discount pricing. Each store will include a bakery, butcher and liquor areas.

“Kaufland will be a one-stop destination supermarket,"" Kaufland said in a statement. ""Our aim is to provide all Australians with more service and choice, highlighted by our principles of simplicity, quality, variety and price.”

“Kaufland is delighted to call Australia our new home. We look forward to continuing our commitment to partner with local businesses and the wider community to ensure we create the best outcome possible.

“Being customer centric is at the heart of all that we do – driven by our values of Performance, Dynamics and Fairness, we aim to increase choice, provide high quality service and promote fair competition to ensure that the customer is always the winner.”",Kaufland receives planning approval for first three Aussie stores
"Metcash has revealed it will spend millions on building or acquiring new liquor stores, expanding private-label offerings and improving 
digital capability.","March 06, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/porters-st-ives%20(1).jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=1&Article=metcash-reveals-plans-to-overhaul-its-liquor-business,"Metcash has revealed it will invest $270 million across its grocery, hardware and liquor businesses over the next five years to improve stores, logistics and digital offerings.

CEO Jeff Adams said it was time to help independent retailers increase sales, respond to changing shopping habits and reverse a long-term decline in market share caused by increased competition from new players such as ALDI.

""The guys have done a great job of stabilising the [food] business over the last few years,"" he told The Australian Financial Review. ""It's a business that had been challenged and lacked investment over a number of years – as a result of that, it's really fallen behind global trends,

""Our plan is to invest back into that business, improve the competitiveness of our retailers and align ourselves better to those global trends.""

The capital expenditure comprises about $100 million for rebranding and refurbishments, with Metcash providing loans to retailers to fund refurbishments, $10 million on small-format store pilots, $25 million on logistics and $30 million on systems including a new loyalty program and promotional platforms.

Metcash supplies about 90% of independent retailers through brands such as Cellarbrations, Bottle-O and Thirsty Camel. It plans to invest about $15 million on building or acquiring new stores, wants to double its share of the on-premise market to 20% and is preparing to roll out the premium Porters Liquor chain nationally.

It will also expand its private-label offerings and tailor ranges to better suit locations and a consumer shift towards premium wine, beer and spirits.

Metcash currently has 70 SKUs across beer, wine and spirits and said it had a ""strong focus"" on growing the wine category.

Digital capability has also been flagged as an area for growth.

Meanwhile, the company is trialling a portfolio of company-owned stores called Bottle-O Warehouse. There are currently three stores in operation - in Tasmania and Victoria - with 10 planned by December 2019. The trial is slated to be completed by the end of FY20, with potential roll-out commencing FY21.

The stores are being touted as a platform to learn new retail concepts and support the roll-out of new programs across the IBA network.

In a trading update, Adams said total food sales for the year to date were marginally higher than the same period last year, but wholesale supermarket sales continued to fall after slipping 1.9 per cent (excluding tobacco) in the first half. Sales remained strong in liquor but hardware sales had softened, reflecting the slow-down in construction activity in the trade sector.

Shares in Metcash rose nearly 5% after it unveiled the plan to turnaround each of its three operating businesses.

New CEO for Metcash Liquor in FY20

Metcash also revealed that the new CEO of its liquor pillar will not commence in the role until early FY20.



 Chris Baddock was announced in October 2018 as the replacement for Scott Marshall, who took up the role of CEO of the Metcash Supermarkets and Convenience division in March 2018.

Formerly the Director of Pinnacle and Direct, which is part of Woolworths’ Endeavour Drinks Group, Baddock said at the time: “I am deeply passionate about the liquor business, and the critical role independent retailers have in it. I am very much looking forward to working with the Metcash team, retailers and suppliers as I transition into this new role next year.""",Metcash reveals plans to overhaul its liquor business
Woolworths has removed a sign from BWS Blacktown that banned customers from purchasing alcohol more than once a day.,"March 08, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/bws-blacktown-2.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=1&Article=controversial-sign-removed-from-bws-store,"Woolworths has removed a sign from one of its BWS stores that banned customers from purchasing alcohol more than once a day.

A caller to 2GB alerted radio announcer Ben Fordham to the sign at BWS Blacktown, in Sydney's western suburbs.

It read: “Due to recurring circumstances and concerns over safety we now have a strict ‘one serve policy’. This means you will only be allowed to be served once per day. We understand how this might affect you and appreciate your understanding in this matter.”

Woolworths told Fordham the sign “was put up in error”.

“While we do treat the responsible service of alcohol very seriously, we don’t have a one service per day policy in our Sydney stores,” a spokesman said.

“Instead we deal with these matters on a case-by-case basis in line with industry leading responsible service of alcohol practices.

“Our team members will refuse service when they have reason to believe a customer is intoxicated or at risk of harm.

“We apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused.”

 The radio station caller said he had already purchased wine at BWS Blacktown, but had forgot he needed a bottle of scotch as a birthday gift for a friend. However, the bottle shop barred him from buying it.

""I said, ‘so you’re not gonna sell me that bottle of scotch now’ and they said, ‘that’s right’,” he told Fordham.",Controversial sign removed from BWS store
AB InBev wants to grow its percentage of sales from lower or no-alcohol beer to 20% by 2025 and Australia has already hit the target.,"March 05, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/great-northern-super-crisp.jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=2&Article=australia-leads-the-world-in-ab-inbev-low-alcohol-beer-market,"AB InBev has announced it wants to grow the percentage of its sales that come from lower or no-alcohol beer to 20% by 2025.

And it's revealed that Australia is one of six countries that's already hit the target, along with China, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama and Honduras.

In 2018, the company launched 12 new no- and low-alcohol beers globally, with Carlton Zero called out as one of the big success stories.

In December, a spokesman for CUB confirmed Carlton Zero ""has been one of the most successful new product launches we’ve ever had"".

According to market research company IRI, monthly sales of non-alcoholic beer in bottle shops increased up to 10-fold in the lead up to Christmas, following Carlton Zero's launch.

Big profit potential in low and no

More than one in four beers drunk globally are brewed by AB InBev, with 8% of its worldwide beer sales by volume coming from beers with lower or no alcohol.

Non-alcoholic brews are the fastest-growing segment in the beer industry. While overall beer sales are stagnating, non-alcoholic-beer sales have grown by 3.9% on average for the past five years according to The Wall Street Journal.

AB InBev CEO Carlos Brito told investors in a call last week that low- and no-alcohol beer are a crucial global trend.

His announcement followed the company releasing its FY18 results, which saw revenue growth of 4.8% for FY18 and a 0.3% increase in volumes.

Australia grew revenue by low single digits, which the company said was ""despite lower volumes due to increased promotional activity by competitors and a softer industry performance amidst declining consumer confidence"".

""Great Northern remains a key engine of growth, with continued double digit growth of both Original and Super

Crisp variants,"" the company added. ""Our craft acquisitions continue to grow in strength with double digit volume growth. In 4Q18, we further strengthened our NABLAB portfolio with the launch of our first non-alcohol beer, Carlton Zero.""

Brito said current moderation and health and wellness trends had led the company to provide consumers with high-quality no- and low-alcohol beers, which can play an important role in reducing harmful consumption.

""A key to explaining this piece of our portfolio's innovation to ensure that we have a robust portfolio to meet different consumer needs,"" he said. :As such we launched 12 new products this year resulting in 76 brands globally that qualify as no- and low-alcohol.

""What makes the segment even more exciting is that this brand is often command a premium price point and the margins are typically higher since excise taxes tend to be lower.

""And in terms of no-and-low alcohol beers, we said for many years now that we see a big opportunity because when you look at health and wellness and when you look at how eclectic beer is, beer can go all the way to zero-zero.""

Brito added that Budweiser 00 was currently being tested in some US markets and had tested ""very well"" in Canada.

The success stories in the full-strength market

As for its regular strength beers, Brito said Budweiser, Stella Artois, and Corona continued to lead growth for AB InBev and now represent more than 20% of total company revenue.

""In 2018 they grew revenue by 9% and 13.1% outside of their home markets where they typically command a premium price point. Budweiser had an outstanding year grew revenue by 10% outside of the US its home country. Much of the success is driven by our biggest and most successful commercial container ever during the World Cup where we'll use our global sponsorship to elevate the brand and introduced it in many new markets.

""Budweiser role in our premium portfolios will offer consumers a trade-off from core beer especially in early-stage maturity markets. It's a high-energy social occasions and it's a flagship premium brand in the boys space.

""Stella to also delivered solid performance with revenue growing 52% this year, the growth was driven by a broad group of markets as the brand experience double-digit revenue growth in more than 25 countries. Stella Artois one of the brands in our portfolio with the richest history with the brewing heritage in its home country of Belgium dating back to 1366 and has an important role to play in our portfolio by owning the meal occasion.

""Corona continues to deliver phenomenal growth this year with global revenue growth of 17.6% and up 28.5% outside its home country of Mexico. This growth was led by China, Colombia, Argentina and Western Europe as well of a very strong performance within Mexico. Corona is our most premium global brand and has a very clear role to play in a portfolio for coed social occasions. Corona currently has a market share of 3% or higher in just three countries where we own the brand. With the brand growing double-digit globally we believe it's still far from reaching its full potential.""",Australia leads the world in AB InBev's lower-alcohol beer push

19 Crimes was the first talking wine label via the AR Living Wine Labels app and has quickly become a $13million brand in Australia, ranking as the third favourite red wine in the $10-$14.99 bracket, according to IRI liquor data.

It's also been the fastest-growing wine brand in the US over the past three years and is in its sixth year of ""phenomenal growth"", with dollar sales increasing by over 70% in the past year.

The Aussie campaign finds a new way to bring to life the rich and authentic story of the convicts turned colonists who feature on the brand’s labels.

Over the next month, 19 Crimes will take over two of Australia’s busiest train stations – Bondi Junction and Sydney Central Station, where the brand will be seen by more than 2.3 million commuters each week.

Heavily focused on out-of-home channels across the eastern seaboard, it also features disruptive hand painted murals with light projections, as well as multiple street posters with jail cell bars covering the prisoners’ mug shots.

“Following the phenomenal success 19 Crimes has had in the US, it’s an exciting time to be launching a campaign for a brand that has already gained traction quickly and organically here in Australia,"" said 19 Crimes Brand Director, Clive Coleman.

""We are thrilled to be bringing the 19 Crimes story to life in a non-conventional and disruptive way. This campaign is a great way to educate consumers on a story rich in history, whilst also highlighting a strong portfolio of quality, affordable wines. It would be a crime not to drink it.”

AVL Chief Executive Neil McGuigan said the half-year result ""again reinforcing that our strategies are correct"".

""The McGuigan brand continues to perform exceptionally well in the UK with sales up 16% when compared to the prior period. McGuigan remains the third largest global wine brand in the UK,"" he said.

The contribution from AVL's UK/Europe operations increased by $1.7 million to $6.4 million due mainly

 to increased sales of the McGuigan brand and improved distribution and mix.

It was also a strong result for the company in Asia, with sales increasing 51%. McGuigan sales increased by 47% while Nepenthe and Tempus sales also increased, but from a lower base.

""While the contribution from the Asian division remains relatively small when compared to other segments of our business, it is showing good growth,"" McGuigan noted. ""As we have previously stated, we remain confident that the long-term outlook for sales into Asia looks positive, but we must manage this growth appropriately in terms of pricing and depletions.""

Australian sales increased by 6% with bottled branded sales up 8% and cask sales up 2%.

Sales of McGuigan increased by 13% and the higher margin brand, Nepenthe, increased by 6%. Tempus Two increased by 3% on the back of promotional phasing with strong expectations following significant growth in the prior period.

Meanwhile, New Zealand sales increased by 16% with all the growth coming from the McGuigan brand.

The company revealed that this year’s vintage is underway and early indications are that the recent extreme heat and dry conditions have negatively impacted yields across most grape growing regions.

""Together with the frost that occurred on some of our vineyards in October last year, we are expecting that our vineyard yields will be at least 10% below expectation,"" McGuigan added.

However, he said the company had already taken steps earlier in the year to ensure it had enough wine by entering into bulk wine supply contracts and through the long-term lease agreement on the 10,000 tonne Millewa vineyard.

The combined impact of this frost plus the recent extreme weather is expected to impact the company's full-year SGARA result by $3million to $5million (before tax) against expectation.

AVL noted that it is continuing its ""transformation from a bulk wine company to a quality respected branded wine business"".

""The transformation is supported by the fact that our three key brands, McGuigan, Tempus Two and Nepenthe, have grown by 64% over the last five financial years. As evidenced by our six month result to December 2018, this transformation is continuing and gathering pace.""",Australian Vintage Limited branded sales up 46%

Parker explained: “I am a true wine lover and I love including wine in family dinners and occasions with friends, so this is a very exciting and fun project for me. I’m so looking forward to every single stage of the creation. I intend to be very hands-on throughout the process, as I am with all my endeavors, and could not be partnering with a better brand than Invivo.”

Invivo said the new collaboration is not a celebrity endorsement, with Parker involved in every aspect of the creation of the new wine, from the naming and label design to the winemaking itself and choosing the final blend. She is also a shareholder in the brand, making this a long-term venture for both parties.

“We want this wine to be 100% Sarah Jessica Parker. So other than selecting the base wines for a Sauvignon Blanc and Rosé, I’ll be taking a back seat and letting her create the blends,” explained Invivo winemaker Rob Cameron. “It comes down to SJP’s palate and preferences. We want to create wines that she truly loves and wants to drink and share with friends.”

Parker added: “Invivo also sent me some of their other wine – which I LOVED – as well they told me a little bit more about their story. I’m so looking forward to travelling to New Zealand to see where the grapes grow and the wine is made. The boys even brought me a pair of “gumboots” which they assure me are the height of Kiwi vineyard fashion. Regardless, happy to have and perhaps even wear them.”

Why SJP? Invivo co-owner Tim Lightbourne said the opportunity came about through a discussion with a mutual friend.

""We didn't want a silent partner or just a familiar face – we wanted someone who will throw themselves into the process and make wine that's all about them and reflects their good taste,"" he told the NZ Herald.

Invivo has been working on the collaboration for over a year.

Parker will attend the Sauvignon Blanc and Rosé launch event in New Zealand later in the year where the wine will be revealed. The wine will be sold into the US and locally.

""Sauvignon Blanc in the States is flying [off shelves] and I think as an industry we are only scratching the surface. There's huge potential,"" said Lightbourne.",Sex And The City star to launch New Zealand wine range

"Metcash has revealed it will spend millions on building or acquiring new liquor stores, expanding private-label offerings and improving 
digital capability.","March 06, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/porters-st-ives%20(1).jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=2&Article=metcash-reveals-plans-to-overhaul-its-liquor-business,"Metcash has revealed it will invest $270 million across its grocery, hardware and liquor businesses over the next five years to improve stores, logistics and digital offerings.

CEO Jeff Adams said it was time to help independent retailers increase sales, respond to changing shopping habits and reverse a long-term decline in market share caused by increased competition from new players such as ALDI.

""The guys have done a great job of stabilising the [food] business over the last few years,"" he told The Australian Financial Review. ""It's a business that had been challenged and lacked investment over a number of years – as a result of that, it's really fallen behind global trends,

""Our plan is to invest back into that business, improve the competitiveness of our retailers and align ourselves better to those global trends.""

The capital expenditure comprises about $100 million for rebranding and refurbishments, with Metcash providing loans to retailers to fund refurbishments, $10 million on small-format store pilots, $25 million on logistics and $30 million on systems including a new loyalty program and promotional platforms.

Metcash supplies about 90% of independent retailers through brands such as Cellarbrations, Bottle-O and Thirsty Camel. It plans to invest about $15 million on building or acquiring new stores, wants to double its share of the on-premise market to 20% and is preparing to roll out the premium Porters Liquor chain nationally.

It will also expand its private-label offerings and tailor ranges to better suit locations and a consumer shift towards premium wine, beer and spirits.

Metcash currently has 70 SKUs across beer, wine and spirits and said it had a ""strong focus"" on growing the wine category.

Digital capability has also been flagged as an area for growth.

Meanwhile, the company is trialling a portfolio of company-owned stores called Bottle-O Warehouse. There are currently three stores in operation - in Tasmania and Victoria - with 10 planned by December 2019. The trial is slated to be completed by the end of FY20, with potential roll-out commencing FY21.

The stores are being touted as a platform to learn new retail concepts and support the roll-out of new programs across the IBA network.

In a trading update, Adams said total food sales for the year to date were marginally higher than the same period last year, but wholesale supermarket sales continued to fall after slipping 1.9 per cent (excluding tobacco) in the first half. Sales remained strong in liquor but hardware sales had softened, reflecting the slow-down in construction activity in the trade sector.

Shares in Metcash rose nearly 5% after it unveiled the plan to turnaround each of its three operating businesses.

New CEO for Metcash Liquor in FY20

Metcash also revealed that the new CEO of its liquor pillar will not commence in the role until early FY20.



 Chris Baddock was announced in October 2018 as the replacement for Scott Marshall, who took up the role of CEO of the Metcash Supermarkets and Convenience division in March 2018.

Formerly the Director of Pinnacle and Direct, which is part of Woolworths’ Endeavour Drinks Group, Baddock said at the time: “I am deeply passionate about the liquor business, and the critical role independent retailers have in it. I am very much looking forward to working with the Metcash team, retailers and suppliers as I transition into this new role next year.""",Metcash reveals plans to overhaul its liquor business
Garradunga Hotel owner Ian “Cambo” Campbell is throwing a free ghost into the sale price of his Far North Queensland pub.,"March 01, 2019",http://drinkscentral.com.au/ContentFiles/drinksBulletin/Images/gardund-2%20(1).jpg,http://www.drinksbulletin.com.au/latest-news?Page=3&Article=garradunga-hotel-sale-includes-free-ghost,"Garradunga Hotel owner Ian “Cambo” Campbell is throwing a free ghost into the sale price of his Far North Queensland pub.

Campbell told the Cairns Post: “Everyone said he was a really nice bloke. He’s definitely friendly.

“I saw him walking up the hall one night. I said, ‘A-a-a-a-athol’, like that and he looked around at me and walked straight through the wall.

“A lot of people say they see a light flying around their room, or sometimes feel something pushing on their chest. But he’s never done any harm.”

About 10 years after Athol died, the Cairns Post reported one of many sightings of the old man. A patron revealing he was singing at the bar when a man dressed in the style of the ’50s or ’60s with dark slacks told him he used to live here years ago.

“I looked over my shoulder and he just faded in front of the wash basin — sort of quickly.”

The pub, which is located few minutes' drive outside Ingham, was built in 1888 and rebuilt in 1935 after being burnt down. The sale also features the bar, publican living quarters, a commercial kitchen and seven hotel rooms.

“It’s a great little pub, it’s a little gold mine,” Campbell said. “It (has) an area for caravans and we get plenty of grey nomads.”",Queensland pub sale includes resident ghost
