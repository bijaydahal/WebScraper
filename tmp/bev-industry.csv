 “While still in its infancy, Sufferfest is at the front of the wave of ‘functional’ alcoholic beverages,” said Sierra Nevada President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff White, in a statement. “By joining with Sierra Nevada, Sufferfest will be better positioned to grow and continue to lead the way in a rapidly growing and highly competitive space.”

 

 Sufferfest, which launched in 2016, is known for its gluten-removed line of beers like its 95-calorie Kolsch brewed with bee pollen and its FKT (Fastest Known Time) Pale Ale brewed with salt and black currant.

 

 “The complementary nature of our offerings and their position at the cusp of this emerging category are not the only reasons Sufferfest made sense,” White said. “From the moment we met, it was clear that our two companies are deeply aligned in our values and our commitment to do the right thing.”

 

 Sufferfest is a Certified B Corp. and a values-driven company. Founder and Chief Executive Officer Caitlin Landesberg, a long-distance trail runner, started the company with a vision to create the perfect post-sweat beer for herself and fellow sufferers.

 

 “I’ve always craved a beer after a race, but when I couldn’t find a beer that agreed with my dietary and performance needs, it left a genuine void in the post-race social experience,” Landesberg said. “The finish line is where we get to celebrate the ail, anguish and suffering we’ve all been through together. I so wanted to continue to be part of this occasion, but didn’t want to keep compromising on taste or ingredients.”

 

 A homebrewers course in 2012 followed by coursework at UC Davis enlightened her on the microbiology of beer and its many positive attributes. She started her quest to develop a beer by athletes, for athletes, and after years of improvements and sampling her beers among fellow runners, local heroes and professional athletes, Sufferfest Beer Co. was born.

 

 “Sierra Nevada is the perfect fit,” Landesberg said. “If it were any other company, this would not be a consideration for us. Sierra Nevada is a family owned and operated business that isn’t driven by shareholder pressure to meet quarterly numbers. I’ve always been so impressed by their commitment to the communities they serve. They are really driven by their own north star.”

 

 White added: “Sufferfest represents an authentic and genuine platform for us to connect with more and different people. This isn’t something cooked up by an ad agency. Sufferfest is a group of tireless, deeply committed people who love to have fun. In other words, they feel like us.”",Sierra Nevada Brewing acquires Sufferfest Beer

The company plans to continue expanding its use of recycled materials in the coming years, further setting an ambition to reach 50 percent recycled plastic by 2025.

The company is expanding its relationship with key supplier, Plastrec (Joliette, Canada), and working with other suppliers, to support the company’s ability to nearly quadruple its use of food-grade recycled plastic, or rPET, in less than three years. This comes on the heels of Nestlé Waters’ announcement last month about the expansion of its partnership with CarbonLITE, as the rPET supplier builds a third U.S. facility in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania.

“We want to take the ‘single’ out of ‘single-use’ bottles. Our bottles were never meant to be thrown in the garbage — we carefully design them to be collected, recycled and repurposed,” says Fernando Mercé, president and chief executive officer of NWNA, in a statement. “PET plastic is a valuable resource that, if recycled properly, can be used to create new bottles again and again. We’re proving that it can be done by making bottles out of other bottles, not ten years from now, but today.”

In its 2016 report titled “The New Plastics Economy: Rethinking the future of plastics,” the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that most plastic packaging is used only once, and that 95 percent of the value of plastic packaging material, worth $80-120 billion annually, is lost to the economy.

In addition to the company’s multi-year supplier agreements, NWNA continues to make indirect investments in recycling infrastructure in the United States through its $6 million investment in the Closed Loop Fund. In municipalities such as Waterbury, Conn., the investment fund is supporting enhanced recycling programs with a goal of increasing the current city recycling rate from 6 percent to 25 percent by 2020. Just recently, the Closed Loop Fund announced a $1.5 million investment in rPlanet Earth, the world’s first completely vertically integrated manufacturer of post-consumer recycled PET.

NWNA also supports recycling collection programs through organizations like Keep America Beautiful, including an integrated recycling education and awareness initiative for the 10,000 students affected by the Flint, Mich., water crisis.

“Through long-term supplier contracts and our commitment to supporting initiatives to improve collection rates, we are helping to stimulate a more robust recycling market, and unlock the potential of a circular economy here in the U.S.,” Mercé said.

Earlier this year, as a result of NWNA’s existing relationship with rPET supplier Plastrec, the company unveiled a new 100 percent rPET Nestlé Pure Life bottle.

In California, NWNA is leading the charge in its use of recycled plastic: more than 42 percent of the plastic the company uses across all brands sold in California is made from rPET, it says. In fact, all single-serve bottles of Arrowhead Brand Mountain Spring Water and Nestlé Pure Life Purified Water produced in California are made with 50 percent recycled plastic, it adds.

“The planet has a problem with plastic pollution. If plastic is going to survive as a packaging material it must demonstrate closed-loop capability,” said Mark Murray, executive director of the environmental group Californians Against Waste, in statement. “Nestlé Waters has embraced this responsibility by accelerating their use of recycled content over the next three years and their commitment to reach 50 percent by 2025. Nestlé Waters is setting the example that the rest of the beverage industry must embrace.”

This latest milestone is part of parent company Nestlé SA’s broader ambition to develop a circular economy for plastics, and to prevent packaging from ending up as litter. The global company recently announced that it has signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment to work collectively on solutions that address the root causes of plastics waste and pollution.

The agreement is designed to accelerate the development and deployment of high-grade recycled content PET for use in bottles used by The Coca-Cola Co.

This investment supports the company’s global vision to work toward a World Without Waste, which includes a goal to create packaging made of at least 50 percent recycled material by 2030. The new technology supports the circular economy for plastics by allowing packages such as colored PET bottles that could have been excluded from certain recycling streams to be recycled into food-grade quality packaging.

The agreement is intended to accelerate scale-up of Ioniqa’s recycling technology for PET. Ioniqa has developed a proprietary recycling technology that is able to convert hard-to-recycle PET-containing waste like colored bottles into purified polymer building blocks that can be later reformed into high quality PET. The technology has been validated at the demonstration scale with value chain partners, and a 10-kMT industrial plant is under construction in The Netherlands for commissioning in 2019.

“Our investment in new and pioneering recycling technologies is an opportunity for significant movement toward closing the loop and creating a circular economy for PET,” said Robert Long, chief innovation officer for The Coca-Cola Co., in a statement. “We plan to continue investment in developing the right partnerships and initiatives — like with Ioniqa — to support our vision of a World Without Waste.” BI","Coca-Cola, Ioniqa Technologies work to support recycling efforts"

The expansion, in partnership with Uber Eats, began in San Francisco on Jan. 21, the first of six new markets to offer the service to customers. Following an initial test in Miami, the company remains on track to bring Starbucks Delivers to nearly one-quarter of U.S. company-operated stores.

The company has planned expansion to select stores in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington, D.C., in the coming weeks, it says. In total, Starbucks Delivers will be available in seven U.S. cities this spring.

The U.S. expansion of Starbucks Delivers follows success of the test in Miami that began in the fall of 2018. The test, also powered by Uber Eats, saw strong demand, including repeat business throughout the day and positive feedback from customers. This expansion coincides with the kickoff of a new pilot, due to begin later this month, which will see London chosen as the first European city to trial Starbucks Delivers, powered by Uber Eats.

The partnership with Uber Eats brings together the fastest-growing meal delivery service in the U.S. with one of the largest food and beverage retailers. Starbucks will leverage Uber’s expertise as a quick and reliable delivery provider that is already well-established in offering customers a premier experience in a growing mobile and on-demand economy, the company says. The partnership also will allow Starbucks to reach new customers who are using the Uber Eats platform, as well as offer existing customers a new method for including Starbucks in their daily routines.

“We know we have untapped customer demand for Starbucks Delivers in the U.S. and starting today, we’re expanding our best-in-class experience to our customers both in and out of our stores,” said Roz Brewer, group president and chief operating officer for Starbucks, in a statement. “We’re building on key learnings from past delivery pilots and by integrating our ordering technology directly with Uber Eats, we’ve unlocked the ability to bring Starbucks to customers for those times when they’re not able to come to us.”

The global online food delivery market currently represents a $95 billion opportunity and is projected to grow by more than 11 percent annually through 2023, citing a Statista report. “eServices. Starbucks now offers delivery service in eleven of the company’s global markets and expects to trial delivery pilots in other countries this year.

Customers will be able to access Starbucks Delivers through the Uber Eats mobile app, available on iOS and Android devices. The following are key features of the Starbucks Delivers experience:

Quick, Reliable Delivery: Powered by the Uber Eats platform, customers can follow orders within the mobile app, tracking progress and location of their Uber courier to ensure proper delivery of their food and beverage items within 30 minutes. Starbucks also has developed packaging solutions to help ensure the quality of hot and cold menu items.

Customization: With approximately 95 percent of core menu items available directly from the Starbucks menu, customers will be able to customize their orders just as they would when ordering on Starbucks mobile apps. Delivery orders will come with an initial $2.49 booking fee.

“At Uber Eats, we’re always looking for new ways to offer people the widest selection of food they love. That’s why we’re so excited to deliver Starbucks fans their favorite food and beverages in a way that’s as easy as requesting a ride,” said Jason Droege, vice president and head of UberEverything, in a statement. “Be it breakfast delivered straight to the soccer field or afternoon lattés to the office, we know this partnership will delight our customers.”

Starbucks Delivers represents the next evolution of the company’s approach to delivery and expanding its digital relationships with customers. In addition to the pilot in Miami and a pilot in the Empire State Building, Starbucks previously tested delivery in Seattle in 2015 for members of the company’s Starbucks Rewards loyalty program. Since that time, the industry has seen a significant increase in demand for food and beverage delivery, it says.

Starbucks Delivers was first announced in August 2018 in China through a partnership with Alibaba and on-demand food delivery service Ele.me. By the end of 2018, delivery services had expanded to 2,000 stores across 30 cities in China, while also being introduced to select stores in Tokyo and Miami. The limited pilot in London will be the first of its kind for Starbucks in Europe and will see a small number of company-operated stores to test and learn from the experience as it looks to scale this option to licensees. Additional global markets with delivery initiatives include India, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, Mexico, Colombia and Chile.",Starbucks Delivers expands in US

They're also challenging some famous friends to spread the word, starting with Sarah Jessica Parker. Pour it Forward is Stella Artois' take on the goodwill trend of pay it forward where enjoying a Stella Artois triggers a donation to Water.org to help provide access to clean water for those living without it.

Sarah Jessica Parker will pay homage to her iconic role of Carrie Bradshaw to underscore that the act of changing your usual drink to Stella Artois can help make an impact. In a spin on the “Sex and the City” opening bus scene, we see what might happen if Carrie were to change up her usual drink of choice, a Cosmo, in favor of a Stella Artois. The spot was created by Mother New York.

""Enjoying Stella Artois helps provide access to clean water for someone in need,"" Parker said in a statement. ""If Carrie was made aware of this important and fantastic partnership and initiative, I'm sure she wouldn't waste a beat putting down her Cosmo and opting for a Stella, and I know that she would encourage all of her friends and audience to do the same.""

Stella Artois and Water.org also are debuting a new video featuring Damon, who shares how simple it is to help change someone's life. A beer is slowly poured into a Stella Artois chalice, triggering adjacent images of taps turning on in the developing world to represent the impact this small action can have around the globe.

""Through our partnership with Stella Artois we have already helped change millions of lives, and we have the opportunity to change millions more,"" Damon said in a statement. ""That's why we're asking people to Pour it Forward and help give access to clean water — simply by enjoying a Stella Artois.""

For a limited time, every Stella Artois helps provide access to clean water for someone living without it:
• Every six-pack sold gives access to six months of clean water for one person in the developing world.
• Every 12-pack sold gives access to 12 months of clean water for one person in the developing world.
• Every pour (or bottle) sold at bars and restaurants gives access to 1 month of clean water for one person in the developing world.

Since 2015, Stella Artois has helped Water.org provide more than 1.7 million people in the developing world with access to clean water, but the brand needs the help of people everywhere to reach their goal of providing 3.5 million people in the developing world with long-term, sustainable access to clean water by 2020 through its partnership with the organization, it says.

""This is just the beginning for Pour it Forward as we launch the program in a big way,"" said Lara Krug, vice president of Stella Artois, in a statement. ""Sarah Jessica Parker is the first, but we'll be recruiting other familiar faces to help spark a movement of people choosing Stella Artois in order to help make a difference.""

For millions around the world, access to funds stands between them and safe water and sanitation in their home. Water.org found that when given an opportunity to pay for water improvements with loans, families opt to finance long-term solutions versus struggle day-to-day to find that next liter of water. Water.org now is a leader in developing market-driven financial solutions to the global water crisis, it says.

""Our partnership with Stella Artois continues to offer easy ways for people to get involved and change lives,"" White said. ""The simplicity of taking action, coupled with Water.org's powerful solutions, enables us to make an even greater impact worldwide as we work towards the ultimate vision of providing access to safe water and sanitation for all.""

As part of the Anheuser-Busch family of brands, the partnership between Stella Artois and Water.org builds on the company's long-standing commitment to creating a cleaner and more sustainable world for future generations, it says. Anheuser-Busch drives progress across their supply chain to reduce environmental impact, preserve natural resources and act as a strong partner to their local communities, it adds. The company works closely with partners like Water.org to ensure their commitments and programs drive meaningful change for the environment and contribute to a shared objective of a better world.","Stella Artois, Water.org partner with Sarah Jessica Parker"

According to an Insights from New York-based Nielsen titled “The Evolution of Super Bowl Consumption,” the market research firm identified how today’s viewing experience has evolved.

Nielsen details that the female fan base remains substantial, noting that it has held steady at about 46-47 percent of total viewership from Super Bowl XLVII in 2014 to Super Bowl LII in 2018.

“Women contribute greatly to growing segments across the adult beverage landscape,” Nielsen states. “They control $4.3 trillion (73 percent) of U.S. spending, and they’re the sole breadwinners in 40 percent of U.S. households with children. Marketers in the adult beverage industry are shifting from a once male-dominated marketing mindset to one with a more balanced, female focus — and with good reason.”

Noting the on-premise (bar, restaurant) environment traditionally struggles on Super Bowl Sunday, Nielsen highlights that breakfast and brunch gained in popularity last year, as on-premise sales increased by 24 percent and 12 percent, respectively, it reports. The market research firm states that one factor could be that women are 32 percent more likely to drink cocktails on-premise than men, highlighting their awareness of low-alcohol, brunch and wine cocktail trends.

“Wine reigns supreme with women, remaining the most popular alcohol for off-premise sales among women,” Nielsen states. “Hard seltzer, the relatively new, low-calorie flavored malt beverage (FMB) entrant, is also increasingly relevant during the big game, as Super Bowl sales have more than tripled since 2016, rising from 0.3 percent to 1.3 percent in 2018.”

Defining the base female football fan as women aged 21 and older who watched (broadcast or cable) regular season NFL games or the Super Bowl, Nielsen details how this demographic has upped its ante when it comes to adult beverage consumption.

“With regard to wine, 11 percent of female football fans drink Pinot Grigio, compared with 7.8 percent of the broader over-21 female population,” Nielsen states. “But let’s not forget about beer, which is the top drink of choice for female football fans, as 38 percent choose the tried-and-true beverage. While the juicy/hazy craze has gotten plenty of attention, women are driving this more than men, as 63 percent enjoy it as a style, versus 60 percent of men.”

Nielsen also pointed the growing presence online alcohol sales for Super Bowl viewers — whether its men or women. “Online wine sales jumped 46 percent from $716,792 on Super Bowl Sunday in 2017 to $1,047,993 on Super Bowl Sunday last year,” the market research says.",Drinking habits for Super Bowl evolve

The digital campaign titled WHY #NOLIMEEMOJI? asks consumers to join Spindrift in the effort to give the citrus fruit the “limelight” by sharing why they love lime on social media using the hashtag #NoLimeEmoji.

""The launch of Spindrift Lime is a direct response to requests from the Spindrift community. Our fans are always submitting new flavor ideas and lime has long been one of the most popular requests,"" says Bill Creelman, founder and chief executive officer of Spindrift, in a statement. ""Lime is actually the most popular flavor in the flavored sparkling water category, but Spindrift is the first brand with scale to make it with real squeezed lime juice.""

In the excitement to tell the world about the new flavor release, the team noticed that there was a whole basket of fruit emojis but no lime. Even with the most recent release of emojis, there still is no lime emoji. Enlisting the help of their community, Spindrift looks to rally those on social media seeking to complete their citrus expression with the tiny lime emoji. To support Spindrift's commitment to giving back, during the WHY #NOLIMEEMOJI? campaign, Spindrift will donate $1 (up to $50,000) for every Instagram or Twitter post using the hashtag #NoLimeEmoji to Whole Kids Foundation now through March 31, 2019, 12:01 a.m. EST.

""As a brand that is making the transition from start-up to household name, we have relied heavily on social media to tell our brand story and keep our loyal fans in the loop on brand news. As we were developing plans for the lime launch and saw that the lime emoji didn't exist, we resolved to help fix the oversight, while highlighting one of our favorite non-profit partners,"" said Spindrift Senior Vice President of Marketing Caroline Kibler.

Kristen Bell, brand ambassador for Spindrift, added: “Up until today, if someone asked me to rate my love of Spindrift on a scale of 1-10, I would have said 10 immediately. But then they brought Lime to my table and now I have no choice but to rate it at a gajillion. Sometimes you don't know what's missing from your life (or fridge) until someone hands it to you. Spindrift has come up with a fun, creative idea for sharing their new Lime flavor and I'm totally on board with #NoLimeEmoji. How could there possibly be two apple emojis and no lime? That's just bonkers. But what I really love is their give back program for every #NoLimeEmoji hashtag that gets posted. It's good for your texts and good for your soul — win, win.”

Spindrift is asking that photos of guacamole, Margaritas, key lime pie, and more should be posted with the hashtag #NoLimeEmoji. Spindrift will use these submissions as part of their proposal to Unicode in the hopes of correcting this small injustice and bringing an official lime fruit emoji to the world in the next emoji release.

""While we want to create buzz around Lime and help lime earn emoji status — at the end of the day, the true focus should be on real ingredients. Whole Kids Foundation provides children across the country with access to healthy, fresh fruits and veggies. We're proud to support this cause because raising awareness for simple, real ingredients is always the most important thing to us,"" Kibler said.

Frito-Lay North America and each of our international sectors performed very well, and our North America Beverages sector made progress throughout the year,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ramon Laguarta in a statement. “While adverse foreign exchange translation negatively impacted reported net revenue performance, our underlying organic revenue growth accelerated in the second half, and we ended the year with 4.6% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, we are excited about the outlook for our business. We are well positioned in large, growing categories and have developed strong and relevant capabilities over the years. In 2019, we aim to capitalize on the momentum we have as we enter the year, and to continue to invest in the capabilities that will better position us for success for years to come.

“For 2019, we expect 4 percent organic revenue growth and approximately 1 percent decline in core constant currency EPS,” he continued. “Our 2019 EPS performance is expected to be impacted by incremental investments that are intended to further strengthen the business, lapping a number of 2018 strategic asset sale and refranchising gains and an increased core effective tax rate in 2019. Importantly, we expect to return to high-single-digit core constant currency EPS growth in 2020.”

For the fourth quarter, reported net revenue was even with the prior year. Foreign exchange translation had a 4-percentage point unfavorable impact on reported net revenue performance and acquisitions, and divestitures had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point. Organic revenue, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions, divestitures, structural and other changes, grew 4.6 percent, it says.

For the North America Beverages (NAB) division, operating profit declined 12 percent, reflecting certain operating cost increases, including increased transportation costs, a 9 percentage point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 4 percentage point impact of prior-year hurricane-related costs, it says.

For the full year, reported net revenue increased 2 percent. Foreign exchange translation and acquisitions and divestitures each had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point. Organic revenue, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions, divestitures, structural and other changes, grew 4 percent.

For NAB, operating profit decreased 16 percent, reflecting certain operating cost increases, including increased transportation costs, a 7 percentage point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings and net revenue growth. Higher gains on asset sales positively contributed 1.5 percentage points to operating profit performance.

According to recent Nielsen data, pear-flavored hard ciders were up 120 percent and Prosecco wines were up about 10 percent during the 52-week period ending Dec. 22, 2018.

The new in-depth study examined state-level alcohol tax receipts and per capita alcohol sales in Colorado, Washington state and Oregon for the two years prior to recreational marijuana legalization and up to three to four years post-legalization.

“Simply put, the data shows there has been no impact on spirits sales from recreational marijuana legalization,” said Distilled Spirits Council Chief Economist David Ozgo in a statement, noting that examining tax data and actual shipments provides the most accurate insight into what is happening in the marketplace.

“We now have four years of retail recreational marijuana sales history in Colorado and Washington state, and three years in Oregon, and each of these markets remain robust for spirits sales,” Ozgo added. He also noted that overall alcohol sales mirror national trends and there is no pattern of declining spirits sales in any of the markets analyzed.

“We did this study because there is a lot of misinformation circulating about the impact of recreational marijuana legalization on distilled spirits and the wider alcohol market,” he added.

The analysis shows that in the three states, per capita spirits sales increased between 3.6 to 7.6 percent since recreational marijuana legalization went into effect. Colorado was up 7.6 percent; Washington state was up 5.4 percent; and Oregon was up 3.6 percent, according to study data.

Additionally, no evidence was found that legal recreational marijuana has impacted total per capita alcohol sales in beer, wine and spirits as follows:
• In the case of per capital beer sales, sales in the three states declined between -2.3 to -3.6 percent, but this is consistent with the national trend in beer sales and is not isolated to just those states that have legalized marijuana sales, Orzgo said.
• In the three states, per capita wine sales were mixed. Colorado was up 3.2 percent; Washington state was down -3.1 percent; and Oregon was up 0.7 percent.
• Per capita total beverage alcohol sales (spirits, wine and beer) were roughly flat, also consistent with the national trend. Colorado was up 1.7 percent; Washington state was down -0.2 percent; and Oregon was down -0.5 percent.

Although the Distilled Spirits Council has taken no position on whether states should legalize recreational use of marijuana, it has established marijuana policy principles that it urges state officials to consider if they pursue legalization of the product.

“If states contemplate marijuana legalization, we urge lawmakers to ensure they fully consider comparable taxes and regulation, strong road safety measures and social responsibility standards when they examine the issue,” said Distilled Spirits Council President and CEO Chris Swonger in a statement.

In addition to Colorado, Oregon, Washington state and the District of Columbia, seven states have legalized sales of recreational marijuana: Alaska, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, and Vermont. In 2019, several states are considering legalizing recreational marijuana, including Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania.

The company's reported results were significantly impacted by the merger between Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc., which was completed on July 9, 2018.

Commenting on the announcement, Keurig Dr Pepper Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bob Gamgort stated: ""We finished 2018 on a strong note, successfully managing through the merger integration and achieving full year results in line with our 2018 targets. We also delivered strong in-market performance, growing market share in carbonated soft drinks, single-serve coffee and other key categories. Looking ahead, we are confident in our outlook for 2019 Adjusted diluted EPS growth of 15 percent to 17 percent, which is in line with our long-term merger target, despite the operating environment becoming more challenging.""

Net sales for the full year of 2018 increased 76 percent to $7.44 billion, compared with $4.23 billion in the year-ago period, primarily reflecting the impact of the merger. Adjusted pro forma net sales of $11.02 billion in 2018 grew 2.3 percent, driven by higher underlying volume/mix of 3.7 percent, with strong performances registered across most categories, partially offset by the net unfavorable impact of 0.5 percent related to changes in the company's allied brands portfolio during the year, which was expected, the company says. Also partially offsetting the growth was unfavorable net price realization of 0.8 percent, driven by continued moderation in strategic pod pricing investments in the Coffee Systems segment, which offset higher net pricing in the balance of the portfolio. Unfavorable foreign currency translation also impacted the year by 0.1 percent.

Retail market performance, as measured by IRI, remained strong for the year, it says. The company's CSD and enhanced flavored and premium unflavored water portfolios registered market share growth in units and dollars, driven by strong performances of Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, Core and Bai. Likewise, the coffee portfolio also performed well for the year, driven by single-serve pod category unit growth, combined with an increase in market share of pods manufactured by KDP, it says.

Since the merger close, KDP repaid approximately $940 million of bank debt, due to the strong operating profit results and ongoing effective working capital management, resulting in the pace of deleveraging in line with the Company's long-term merger target.

Net sales of the Beverage Concentrates division for the year totaled $669 million, reflecting results of the segment since the merger close. Adjusted pro forma net sales increased 3.8 percent to $1.33 billion in 2018, compared with $1.28 billion in the year-ago period, driven by higher net price realization of 3.2 percent and favorable volume/mix of 0.6 percent.

Dr Pepper fueled the growth in adjusted pro forma net sales for the segment, along with broad-based strength across the portfolio, particularly for A&W and, to a lesser extent, Squirt, Schweppes, Big Red and Canada Dry, partially offset by Crush and Sunkist. Shipment volume growth for the segment was led by Canada Dry, Big Red and Hawaiian Punch, partially offset by Crush and, to a lesser extent, 7UP.

Operating income totaled $430 million for the year, reflecting results of the segment since the merger close. Adjusted pro forma operating income increased 5.1 percent to $858 million in 2018, compared with $816 million in 2017, primarily reflecting the benefits of the adjusted pro forma net sales growth and lower marketing spending.

Net sales for the Packaged Beverages division for the year totaled $2.42 billion, reflecting results of the segment since the merger close. Adjusted pro forma net sales advanced 4.1 percent to $5.07 billion in 2018 compared to $4.87 billion in 2017, reflecting strong underlying volume/mix of 5.4 percent, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of 1.2 percent resulting from changes in the Allied Brands portfolio during the year, as expected. Slightly lower net price realization of 0.1 percent also impacted the comparison. Driving the adjusted pro forma net sales performance were Canada Dry, Core, Bai and BODYARMOR, as well as contract manufacturing, partially offset by declines in Fiji, Vita Coco and Hawaiian Punch.

""As we pursue our new vision to 'Be the Global Leader in Convenient Foods and Beverages by Winning with Purpose,' we have taken some important steps to reorganize our leadership team,” said PepsiCo Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ramon Laguarta, in a statement. “We believe these changes will enable us to better capture growth opportunities by getting closer to our consumers and deploying our global capabilities in a way that allows us to win locally in each of our markets.”

The following moves are effective immediately:

Laxman Narasimhan, currently chief executive officer of Latin America (LATAM), Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA), has been appointed to the newly created position of global chief commercial officer for PepsiCo, reporting to Laguarta. In this new role, Narasimhan will shape PepsiCo's integrated long-term growth strategy and lead the development of world-class commercial and marketing capabilities, the company says. Narasimhan will oversee PepsiCo's global category groups, insights, commercialization, design, global research and development (R&D), eCommerce and strategy.

Silviu Popovici, who has led ESSA reporting to Narasimhan now will be chief executive officer of ESSA and report directly to Laguarta. Narasimhan will continue to lead PepsiCo's LATAM sector on an interim basis.

Narasimhan has served several senior leadership positions with increasing responsibility during his tenure at PepsiCo. In his most recent role, he oversaw the company's food and beverage businesses across LATAM and ESSA, with a focus on unlocking new growth opportunities for the two organizations, harmonizing commercial strategies and operating practices, developing talent, and evolving culture, the company says. Prior to that, as LATAM chief executive officer, he successfully grew the business, transformed its operating model, strengthened relationships with franchise bottlers, and forged new collaborations with governments and NGOs in pursuit of the company's sustainability agenda, it says.

“Laxman is the ideal executive to take on this important new role with his vast operating experience, strategic acumen and successful track record unlocking growth opportunities across our businesses and sectors. He will be instrumental as we sharpen our integrated long-term growth strategy and execute our plans to deliver sustainable, attractive marketplace and financial performance,” Laguarta said.

At the same time, the company continues to delayer operating businesses with a goal of becoming faster and more locally focused. Following the recent moves that Frito Lay North America and PepsiCo Beverages North America will report directly into Laguarta, the following leaders of key businesses and geographies will now report to Laguarta:

The above changes will have no impact on PepsiCo's external financial reporting structure, the company says. The company also will continue to report segments as FLNA, LATAM, Quaker Foods North America, North America Beverages, ESSA, AMENA, consistent with current practice.

In addition, the company also announced a change in leadership in its R&D organization. Dr. Mehmood Khan, vice chairman and chief scientific officer of global research and development, will retire from PepsiCo this month. He will remain with the company in an advisory capacity.

During the past decade, Khan led research and development efforts for PepsiCo, driving innovation with new products, packaging and processes. During his tenure, PepsiCo became respected as a worldwide leader in science and innovation, attracting top talent in fields such as agronomy, nutrition, biology, food science and engineering, the company says. At the same, Khan was instrumental in defining PepsiCo's sustainability goals while being an active voice externally, urging others to join PepsiCo in its efforts to build a more sustainable food system, it adds.

Rene Lammers, currently senior vice president of category R&D, has been appointed to the role of chief science officer, reporting to Narasimhan. In this role, Lammers will be responsible for building R&D capabilities as the company looks to continue to expand its product portfolio. In his most recent role, Lammers was responsible for driving an integrated agenda across product, process, equipment and packaging technologies. Since joining PepsiCo in 2010, Lammers has held leadership roles across long-term research, global functions, governance and compliance and the global beverage category.

“Rene is a proven leader with a strong track record of success, and his vision and oversight of our R&D function will be critically important as we work to build a robust innovation pipeline to support our growth,” Laguarta said. “On behalf of our executive team and the entire PepsiCo organization, I would like to thank Mehmood for his tireless work at PepsiCo over the last decade building our global R&D technologies and capabilities, shaping our sustainability strategy, and recruiting top talent to our team. I appreciate his willingness to stay on as an adviser to me and the company. We wish him all of the best in his next chapter.”",PepsiCo announces senior leadership changes

RETHINK Juice Splash launches nationwide with two flavors — Watermelon and Fruit Punch — and two more — Kiwi Strawberry and Strawberry Lemonade — coming in the second quarter.

The product line will be available in Walmart and Kroger locations across in the country starting in mid-March. Retail availability will continue to grow with seasonal resets achieving more than 8,000 points of distribution by August 2019.

RETHINK Juice Splash will serve as a complement to their RETHINK Kid’s Water line, which launched in 2018, and brings the company one step closer to its ultimate company goal of developing a comprehensive product portfolio capable of satisfying both child and mom, in terms of health, function, and flavor, it says.

By replacing a single legacy juice box with RETHINK Juice Splash — comprised of 95 percent water, naturally sweetened with 5 percent organic juice concentrate, and enhanced with organic monk fruit — the product can eliminate up to 20 percent of a child’s daily intake of sugar, the company says. The beverage line is USDA Certified Organic, contains no added sugar and has only 5 calories in each serving.

“We have seen low/no sugar, better-for-you options developed in food and snacks for kids, including candy, baby food, chips, bars, frozen meals, Lunchables, smoothies, and even Popsicles, however, it hasn’t happened in the world of beverage,” said Matt Swanson, founder and chief executive officer of Rethink Brands Inc., in a statement. “Put another way, healthy options for a human’s most important daily consumable, beverage, don’t exist for our most important humans, children. That simply makes no sense.”

RETHINK Brands intends to continue its pursuit to improve the healthy beverage options available to children today. In terms of both form and functional benefit, RETHINK Brands aims to rebuild a $5 billion category, left to decline, despite its incredible impact on the health of future generations, it says.",RETHINK Brands makes splash in kid’s drink category

With Dos Equis as the No. 1 Mexican franchise on draft, according to a Nielsen volume report based on total U.S. sales for 4 weeks ending Dec. 29, 2018, and Tecate possessing 75 years of Mexican heritage and yielding 41 percent greater dollar lift versus import segment when promoted, according to a Nielsen 52-week sales report ending Sept. 22, 2018, these two brands are sure to bring some spice to Cinco this season, the company says. Additionally, earlier this year Tecate launched Tecate Titanium, a Mexican import with a high alcohol by volume.

In 1930, Elizabeth F. Lee founded Ocean Spray alongside two partners. At a time when the farming industry was predominantly male, Lee trusted her vision and strength to drive Ocean Spray forward. On International Women's Day, the farmer-owned cooperative is sharing its belief that teams are stronger with a diversified workforce.

Lee's passion for the cranberry helped establish Ocean Spray, a unique cooperative that has served farmers for nearly a century. Approximately 10 years before Rosie the Riveter's debut, Lee was striving to create her business and bring a tiny superfruit with a bold taste to mainstream America, according to the company.

With the shared goal of growing the cranberry market, Lee joined forces with two other cranberry titans to create Cranberry Canners Inc., the agricultural cooperative that would become Ocean Spray. As vice president of Cranberry Canners, Lee pioneered canned cranberry sauce, according to the company.

Following Lee's legacy, women play an important role on Ocean Spray's farms, generation after generation, it says. Ocean Spray farmer families diligently care for their cranberry farms year-round, growing nutrient-dense cranberries. Whether they are watching frost to ensure the superfruit is protected, or conserving water for re-use on the farm, these farmers are making a powerful impact for all families, it explains.

Off the farm, Ocean Spray also values its female leaders. In the past year, Ocean Spray promoted more than 70 women in its workforce, representing 67 percent of all promotions for the farmer-owned cooperative. ""Diversity and inclusion — of gender, race, sexual orientation, culture, experience, background, and so much more — is the heart of any successful organization,"" said Jane Borkowski, vice president of corporate affairs and chief people officer, in a statement. ""I have had the incredible opportunity to grow my career with Ocean Spray, making it particularly special for me to have a direct role championing our next generation of female leadership to spearhead our cooperative's future."" Ocean Spray will celebrate its women throughout the month of March with professional development seminars, networking breakfasts, community engagement, and the launch of its women's empowerment coalition.

On International Women's Day — a day to reflect on the social, cultural, economic and political achievements of women — it is important to honor women of the past for their foresight and fortitude, as well as the women of the present who continue to shatter glass ceilings with tenacity and intelligence, Ocean Spray says. Each woman's story today sets an example for all women of the future, it adds.","Ocean Spray highlights past, present for International Women's Day"

With the help of the party panel, Smirnoff hopes to find the most exciting, outrageous, silly and wild ideas to celebrate America — all with responsible drinking in mind, of course.

Contestant finalists 25 years and older will get the chance to pitch their patriotic party to a panel comprised of some of the most fun-loving people around:
• Comedian, actor and life of the party Nicole Byer

""The Smirnoff Party Pitch contest is all about bringing people together to celebrate inclusive, good times,"" said Stephanie Pavone, brand manager for Smirnoff, in a statement. ""As a brand dedicated to unpretentious fun, we believe that no matter who you are or who you are with — you can always enjoy quality, affordable vodka. This Fourth of July, we're taking that belief to the next level by equipping our fans with everything they need to fulfill their party vision with the drink of summer: Smirnoff Red, White & Berry.""

Smirnoff Party Pitch is the latest extension of Smirnoff's ""Welcome to the Fun%"" campaign. Now through March 27, party people across America ages 25 and older are encouraged to get into the summertime spirit early and submit their party pitches at www.smirnoff.com/contest/party-pitch. As part of the written entry submission, each contestant will need to share how they'd serve Smirnoff Red, White & Berry at their party.

Here's how it works: submissions will be reviewed by Smirnoff and an independent judging agency will select four contestant finalists and bring each of their party pitches to life in a video. Those videos will then be shared with the panelists who will select one grand-prize winner whose pitch is as lit as Fourth of July fireworks. Smirnoff will take that idea from imagination to ""IRL"" and create an epic celebration for the winner and a group of their friends (25 years or older). In addition to the grand-prize winner, three runner-up contestants will each receive $2,500 and some festive swag to help them celebrate the Fourth of July.

To showcase the most memorable moments, Smirnoff will share it all on their YouTube channel leading up to the Fourth of July holiday.

""Y'all know I love a good ole contest,"" said Alyssa Edwards, Smirnoff partner and reality TV star, in a statement. ""This go around, I'm thrilled to be on the other end as an official judge. I can't wait to see (and taste) the drop-dead gorgeous cocktails our contestants dream up. The thing about Smirnoff Red, White & Berry is that she's not only dressed in the season's best colors but her cherry, blue raspberry and citrus flavors scream America.""

Returning to shelves nationwide in April, Smirnoff Red, White & Berry is a limited-edition vodka specialty that's back by popular demand and captures the all-American spirit with its red, white and blue bottle. The limited-edition product is available for a suggested retail price of $12.99 for a 750-ml bottle and $19.99 for a 1.75-liter bottle.",Smirnoff gears up for summer with Party Pitch contest

The conference brings together 13,000 brewing industry professionals for more than 70 different educational seminars led by the top minds in the beer world and access to BrewExpo America, the largest brewing trade show in the U.S. featuring more than 700 vendors.

For 2019, the annual tradeshow and expo will take place April 8-11 at the Colorado Convention Center in Denver.

As small and independent craft brewers face unique opportunities and challenges in the marketplace, the CBC allows them to connect with their colleagues and comrades to share ideas and learn about relevant topics ranging from brewery operations to sustainability and government affairs, while shopping for the products and services they need to run their breweries, the association says.

The event will feature 84 educational seminars and attendees can choose from 12 educational tracks to personalize their schedules.

Attendees also will get a chance to hear from keynote speaker Bruce Dickinson. Dickinson is the lead singer of Iron Maiden, a commercial pilot, brewmaster, entrepreneur and creative business thinker. He was a pilot and marketing director for Astraeus Airlines, a company that leased aircraft to other carriers, and is the chairman and founder of Cardiff Aviation, which specializes in heavy maintenance of Airbus and Boeing commercial aircraft. Dickinson will share the parallels between his music and business careers, and the lessons you can take away from both success and failure, it says.

While reported net revenues declined because of refranchising and currency headwinds, the company delivered organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth within its long-term target for the sixth consecutive quarter, while also gaining value share globally, it said.

“I am pleased with our strong organic revenue and earnings growth in 2018. Our results demonstrate progress in our transformation as a consumer-centric, total beverage company and the power of a more strategically aligned system,” said James Quincey, chief executive officer of The Coca-Cola Co., in a statement. “Coca-Cola has established a strong foundation to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities and drive sustained shareowner value.”

Net revenues declined 6 percent to $7.1 billion for the quarter and declined 10 percent to $31.9 billion for the year. Fourth quarter and full year results were impacted by headwinds of 13 percent and 17 percent, respectively, from the combined impact of currency and the refranchising of company-owned bottling operations, it says.

The company continued to strengthen its sparkling soft drinks portfolio and build consumption rituals through innovation, premiumization and revenue growth management initiatives, it adds. In North America, innovation in the Diet Coke brand, along with the continued success of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, led to an 8-point acceleration in retail value growth for the no-calorie sparkling soft drinks portfolio for the year.

The company’s increased speed and agility, coupled with the strength of its distribution system, helped launch approximately 500 products across multiple markets through the lift, shift and scale strategy while also accelerating the elimination of underperforming SKUs during the year. The company also announced several key acquisitions in 2018, including Costa Limited, which provides a platform to build a global coffee business, and a strategic partnership with BODYARMOR, one of the fastest-growing beverage trademarks in the United States.

“Mini bottle is one of the most exciting innovations we’ve seen in packaging in a long time. We know that people want more drink options and mini bottle is just one way that we’re meeting that desire,” said Darlene Nicosia, president of Coca-Cola Ltd., in a statement. “And it’s not just smaller package sizes, we’re also working to bring more low- and no-calorie drinks to the market to help Canadians choose the package size and sugar content that makes sense for them.”

The new mini bottle packaging is the first of its kind in North America. Because its small size can affect the carbonation during the packaging process, the mini bottle uses an innovative coating called FreshSafe, which increases shelf life by as much as four months, the company says. The packaging is still 100 percent recyclable just like other PET plastic bottles. The company’s bottling partner, Coca-Cola Canada Bottling Ltd. invested $20 million to upgrade production line capabilities at the Brampton plant to support mini bottle production. The investment will create three new jobs to start and provides the potential to introduce other smaller packages in the future, it says.

“We are so proud that one of our first announcements as an independent bottling company is that we have invested back in our Brampton facility,” said Todd Parsons, president and chief executive officer of Coca-Cola Canada Bottling Ltd., in a statement. “Having a local spirit and supporting our communities is very important to us and our aim is to grow our capabilities in Canada, which will in turn, grow jobs.”

The investment follows an announcement last spring that Coca-Cola Ltd. is investing $85 million to build a new plant in Peterborough, Ontario, to support production of fairlife ultrafiltered milk. The new facility is on track to begin operations in spring 2020.

The mini bottle will be available in two packages nationwide: a 250 ml-single serving bottle and an eight-pack of 300-ml bottles.",Coca-Cola mini bottles enter Canadian market

Four Corners brings together the culture of craft brewing with Mexican-American bicultural heritage, creating flavorful, craft beers accompanied by vibrant, lotería-inspired branding, the company says. The brewery is perched at the intersection of the growing popularity of traditional Mexican import beers and the innovative nature of craft brewing. This blend results in a craft brewery with the ability to appeal to a wide range of culturally diverse beer drinkers, it adds.

""Four Corners Brewing Co. is a collective beer journey that has taken us from better-beer enthusiasts and homebrewers to launching and nurturing our brand with the people of Texas for more than seven years,"" said Co-Founder George Esquivel in a statement. ""We're proud and excited that our journey now provides the opportunity to brew our bold, delicious beers in San Diego and raise a pint with the people of Southern California.""

Four Corners will launch in Southern California with two flagship offerings: El Chingón IPA and new El Grito Lager. Both now are available throughout Los Angeles and San Diego in colorful seis-packs, priced around $9.99 for El Chingón IPA and $8.99 for El Grito Lager. The beers also will be available on draft at popular bars and restaurants. The brewery plans to introduce more beers from its line-up to SoCal over time, it adds.

""There are many IPAs but only one is 'El Chingón',"" Esquivel said. As the name indicates, the beer is aggressive with a chingón factor of 7.3 percent alcohol by volume (ABV) and 72 international bittering units (IBU), the company says. The brew profile is malt forward balanced with a badass blend of American C hops, it adds. The label artwork of a big hop cone is a symbol of reverence to the West Coast-style IPA movement, which served as its inspiration.

Currently, fairlife produces dairy-based beverages at its production plant in Coopersville, Mich., and distributes to beverage retailers across the United States and Canada. “I’m extremely proud that the demand for our milk has grown so much that we now need another manufacturing site,” said Chief Operating Officer for fairlife Tim Doelman, in a statement. “In choosing a new plant location, it is essential that the new facility be built in an area where dairy farms are willing and able to follow fairlife’s responsible animal care and sustainable farming practices while producing the highest quality milk. Not only are there amazing dairy farmers in and around Goodyear, its location enables competitive domestic and international production.”

The new $200-plus million facility, which is slated to begin operation in the back half of 2020, will house production lines that will play a key role in meeting the growing demand for fairlife, the company says. Working with the United Dairymen of Arizona (UDA) to source milk from numerous dairy farmers in Goodyear, the new fairlife plant will enable increased production of all fairlife products, including the different varieties of fairlife ultra-filtered milk, Core Power, fairlife YUP!, fairlife smart snacks and fairlife nutrition plan, it adds.

The new facility also is set to incorporate advanced manufacturing technologies and efficient, energy-saving equipment to reduce power consumption. It also will create more than 140 jobs locally and augment benefits within the local economy, from the development and construction of the facility to the continuous resources and suppliers needed to support daily operations, the company says.

“I am pleased with our strong organic revenue and earnings growth in 2018. Our results demonstrate progress in our transformation as a consumer-centric, total beverage company and the power of a more strategically aligned system,” said James Quincey, chief executive officer of The Coca-Cola Co., in a statement.

Net revenues declined 6 percent to $7.1 billion for the quarter and declined 10 percent to $31.9 billion for the year. Fourth quarter and full year results were impacted by headwinds of 13 percent and 17 percent, respectively, from the combined impact of currency and the refranchising of company-owned bottling operations, it says.

The company continued to strengthen its sparkling soft drinks portfolio and build consumption rituals through innovation, premiumization and revenue growth management initiatives, it adds. In North America, innovation in the Diet Coke brand, along with the continued success of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, led to an 8-point acceleration in retail value growth for the no-calorie sparkling soft drinks portfolio for the year.

The company’s increased speed and agility, coupled with the strength of its distribution system, helped launch approximately 500 products across multiple markets through the lift, shift and scale strategy while also accelerating the elimination of underperforming SKUs during the year.
